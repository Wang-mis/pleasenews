02EDICGONA_K82WE8DPGLFVRF1,Khan Younis: Israel says forces have encircled Gaza's second city,By David Gritten,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68074566,"The Israeli military says its ground forces have encircled Khan Younis, the southern Gaza Strip's largest city.
Troops have also reportedly advanced deeper into remaining parts of the city, where they believe Hamas leaders are hiding in tunnels with hostages.
Residents said tanks had shut the last road out of the city to the Mediterranean coast, effectively stopping them from fleeing southwards.
There was also intense fighting around the city's two main hospitals.
It came as funerals took place for some of the 24 Israeli soldiers killed on Monday on the deadliest day for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) since the start of its ground offensive in Gaza 12 weeks ago.
At least 195 Palestinians were also killed in Gaza over the previous 24 hours, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
The ministry says more than 25,400 people have been killed - mostly children and women - during the war between Hamas and Israel.
It was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,300 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 250 others taken hostage.
Israeli ground forces expanded their operation into southern Gaza in early December, after largely taking control of Hamas strongholds in the north.
Within days they were said to have reached the ""heart"" of Khan Younis, where hundreds of thousands of people who had fled northern areas were sheltering.
But the troops have since faced fierce resistance from Hamas's Khan Younis Brigade. It is considered to be one of the two strongest in the group, which is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other countries.
The Israeli operation has expanded and intensified in recent days, with dozens of people reported killed in air and artillery strikes on Monday alone as tanks pushed into the west and centre of the city.
On Tuesday, the IDF put out a statement saying that over the past day its troops had ""carried out an extensive operation during which they encircled Khan Yunis and deepened the operation in the area"".
The troops had ""engaged in close-quarters combat, directed [air] strikes, and used intelligence to co-ordinate fire, resulting in the elimination of dozens of terrorists"", it added.
The IDF also ordered residents of western Khan Younis to move immediately to the al-Mawasi area, on the Mediterranean coast, for their own safety.
However, some witnesses said tanks had blocked the road leading there, preventing them from joining the estimated million people currently sheltering to the south in Rafah, on the border with Egypt.
""I am trying to leave for Rafah but the tanks are now very near to the coast and are firing toward the west,"" Shaban, an electrical engineer with four children, told Reuters news agency.
The World Health Organization meanwhile said it was deeply concerned by reports of attacks on hospitals in Khan Younis.
On Tuesday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said a civilian had been killed by an Israeli drone at the entrance of Al-Amal Hospital, which it runs, and that others had been injured when shells struck its nearby headquarters.
""The situation remains extremely dangerous. Early this morning, there was direct artillery shelling of the Palestine Red Crescent's headquarters on the fourth floor. Israeli drones did not stop firing at people at al-Amal Hospital,"" spokeswoman Nebal Farsakh told the BBC from Ramallah.
""[There is] panic and fear among thousands of displaced people who are taking shelter inside our facilities.""
There was no immediate comment from the IDF, but it has previously accused Hamas fighters of embedding themselves among the civilian population and operating in and around medical facilities.
Ms Farsakh also said ambulances were ""facing significant challenges to reach wounded people and transport them to hospitals"", adding that they were now being told to take critical cases to Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza.
And she warned that Al-Amal and the nearby Nasser Medical Complex - the largest of the 14 hospitals still partly working in Gaza - were ""overwhelmed and overcrowded"".
Dr Haytham Ahmad, who works in Nasser's emergency department, told the BBC that multiple amputations were being performed, and that in some cases, patients were not being given anaesthetic because of a shortage of supplies.
""These cases have severe crush injuries and there is just some skin and muscle still connected. We try to use limited anaesthetic in this situation,"" he said.
A World Health Organization spokesman said Nasser was ""now basically besieged"" and that there was ""no way in and out"" for its 400 patients, as well as the medical staff treating them and displaced civilians.
Gaza's health ministry alleged that Israeli forces had fired ""heavily on the upper floors of the specialised surgery building and the emergency building"" of the hospital.
One video filmed by a Palestinian journalist appeared to show gunfire hitting the hospital's western corner, while in another clip smoke is seen rising from an area to the south.
The IDF told AFP news agency that it was ""not aware of the event"".
Later, UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was ""appalling"" and that the entire population was ""enduring destruction at a scale and speed without parallel in recent history"".
He also once again appealed for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman said it was ""engaging in serious discussions with both sides"" on a potential deal, and a Palestinian official told the BBC that a Hamas delegation had arrived in Cairo on Tuesday morning to ""discuss new proposals"" with Egypt's intelligence minister.
Israel has not denied that it has proposed a two-month truce, involving the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners. But there are reports that has already been rejected by Hamas, which demands a permanent ceasefire.

06G34D3AKN_RQUQJS0H872NGSR,Spanish triple murder linked to online romance scam,By Guy Hedgecoe,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68066311,"Spanish police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the murder of three elderly siblings and its connection to an online romance scam that two of them were caught up in.
The civil guard have arrested a 42-year-old man of Pakistani origin, identified as Dilawar Hussain F.C.
They said he handed himself in and confessed to the murders.
The bodies of siblings Amelia, 67, Ãngeles, 74, and JosÃ© GutiÃ©rrez Ayuso, 77, were found at their home last week.
They had been partially burned.
The three lived together in Morata de TajuÃ±a, a town of around 8,000 inhabitants south-east of Madrid.
The civil guard said the motive of the crime appeared to be a debt the siblings had with the suspect, linked to the sisters' apparent involvement in an online scam.
Friends and neighbours of the siblings have told local media of how Ãngeles and Amelia had been engaged for several years in online relationships with people claiming to be men from the US.
According to these reports, the two women had sent up to â¬400,000 (Â£340,000) to a man they knew as ""Edward"", supposedly in the US military, and a friend of his. At least some of their contact with these people was via Facebook.
JosÃ© GutiÃ©rrez Ayuso, who had a mental disability, was not involved in the sending of the money.
These relationships had exhausted the siblings' finances, causing the sisters to ask local people for money and approach informal lenders. They even asked the mayor and priest of Morata de TajuÃ±a for money, according to Spain's ABC newspaper.
Mr Hussain had got to know the siblings when he lived in their home as a lodger for several months. He told police that the sisters owed him a large sum of money which he had given them as a high-interest loan but which they had failed to pay back.
Mr Hussain attacked Amelia twice when still living in her home, the second time in February of 2023 with a hammer, causing her to require medical attention. He received a two-year jail sentence and a restraining order but was released after seven months last September.
Police entered the home of the three siblings on Thursday, after neighbours said they had not seen or heard from them for several weeks.
Enrique Velilla, a local man who was a friend of the siblings, said that the women's insistence on sending money to their supposed boyfriends had caused them to sell a property they owned in Madrid.
He also said that their requests for money had caused their bank to warn them about a possible scam.
""We told them that it was all a lie, that it was a scam,"" he said. ""But they didn't want to hear the word 'scam'.""
He added: ""Ãngeles was a teacher and Amelia had an education. They weren't stupid. They were ordinary people who fell in love.""

0874ZL8ALD_NHUCKGWHXXD64KX,In-N-Out Burger closes Oakland store over crime concerns,By Madeline Halpert,4 days ago,20230124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68084164,"In-N-Out Burger is closing its only store in Oakland, California due to concerns about crime, the company said.
It marks the first time in its 75-year history that the company has shut down a location, according to In-N-Out.
""Despite taking repeated steps to create safer conditions, our Customers and Associates are regularly victimized by car break-ins, property damage, theft, and armed robberies,"" it said in a statement.
The store will close on 24 March.
While data suggests several different types of crime - including murders - fell on a national level in 2023, burglaries, robberies and motor vehicle thefts rose in the city of Oakland on the east side of San Francisco Bay.
Violent crimes increased by 18% from 2019 to 2022, according to data from the police department. Robberies rose by 37% and burglaries by 24% in 2023, according to data reviewed by KPIX, a local affiliate of the BBC's US partner CBS News.
In just the area surrounding the In-N-Out near the Oakland International Airport, police have reported 1,335 incidents of crime since 2019, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.
The popular burger joint had served Oakland customers for over 18 years. In a statement shared with US media, the chain restaurant's Chief Operating Officer Denny Warnick said that while the company had relocated restaurants over the years, it had never before completely shut down a store.
The company said it recognised the shuttering would negatively affect employees and their families. All staff were offered the chance to transfer to nearby restaurants or receive a severance package, it said.
""[T]his location remains a busy and profitable one for the company, but our top priority must be the safety and wellbeing of our Customers and Associates - we cannot ask them to visit or work in an unsafe environment,"" In-N-Out said in a statement.
Several businesses have closed in the California city due to crime, including a Starbucks and several local businesses.
Several national corporations have also shuttered stores in other parts of the US, citing rising crime. Target, for example, announced in September it would close nine stores in four states over retail theft, despite data suggesting levels of crime were not necessarily worse at those store locations than others in the same city.
Nationally, the US murder rate fell by more than 12% last year, while violent crime also dropped substantially, according to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The Met Police said officers were alerted at 01:20 GMT on Monday and four people were seen running from the scene.
The paint was sprayed ahead of the International Armoured Vehicles conference, which began later on Monday.
Protest group Palestine Action said on its website that it was behind the move to protest arms sales to Israel.
A demonstration was held outside the conference
The phrase ""Free Gaza"" was written on the wall and police said paint-filled fire extinguishers had Palestine Action written on them.

0CGGS7EMHV_UGGKUHMYMDIFN76,Storm Isha forces UK flights to divert to France and Germany,By Jacqueline Howard,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68053499,"Storm Isha has forced a number of UK and Ireland flights to divert to France and Germany, with passengers finding themselves stranded in airports abroad.
Planes heading for Bristol, Dublin and London ended up in Paris, as Edinburgh-bound planes landed in Cologne.
Some on domestic routes had left their passports at home, meaning they had to sleep on terminal floors overnight.
One flight from Budapest returned to Hungary, via Manchester, after aborting several landings at Stansted Airport.
Parts of the UK have seen their strongest winds in 10 to 20 years.
Kerry Hamilton was returning home on an EasyJet flight from Edinburgh to Bristol after a weekend visiting her parents.
While other flights had been outright cancelled, this one suffered only an hour's delay.
But once it got off the ground, it was clear something was wrong.
""We got towards Bristol and were told the winds were too high for us to land safely, and we would try circling to see if they would reduce,"" Ms Hamilton told the BBC.
""They didn't, so we were told we were diverting to Paris because a lot of the UK airports were closed or not safe to land at.""
Since a domestic route had now become international, many passengers who had left their passports at home were unable to pass through immigration to access a hotel.
Ms Hamilton told the BBC the pilot informed passengers he ""hadn't considered"" the issue.
EasyJet said: ""As the weather was not set to improve, the flight was delayed overnight and we have been doing all possible to minimise the impact for our customers, providing hotel accommodation and meals.
""Some customers not carrying a passport have been required by the French authorities to remain in the airport and so we have been working with the airport to make them as comfortable as possible, ahead of the flight's departure today.
""While the circumstances are outside of our control, we are very sorry for the inconvenience this will have caused.""
Luke Bromage-Henry was also on a domestic flight that was diverted to Paris yesterday evening.
His plane was supposed to leave Jersey at 19:35 GMT, bound for London Gatwick, but instead took off at 23:35, after several hours sat on the runway.
A landing was attempted at Gatwick but due to strong winds the pilot announced a redirection to France, landing at 03:30 local time (02:30 GMT).
""Worst trip to Paris ever,"" he told the BBC.
""As soon as buses dropped us off at the transfer terminal, it was like every man for themselves,"" he added.
Both Ms Hamilton and Mr Bromage-Henry spent the night in the terminal at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport.
""I slept for about two hours underneath some chairs in the transfer terminal,"" Mr Bromage-Henry said.
He was automatically rebooked onto an EasyJet flight from Paris to Gatwick on Monday morning. Ms Hamilton was due to depart at 13:00 local time (12:00 GMT).
Meanwhile, Declan Cassidy had been on a flight from Manchester to Dublin when it was also diverted to Paris.
The pilot had aborted landing at the Irish capital's airport several times due to strong winds.
""It was crazy [and] like being on one of those bulls that throw you off,"" he said.
The flight eventually made its way to Dublin.
Other diverted planes include Ryanair flights from Tenerife and Seville headed for Edinburgh which ended up in Germany's Cologne Bonn Airport.
Passengers on a Ryanair flight from Budapest to London Stansted were flown back to Hungary after several attempts to land at the airport were abandoned.
Describing the aborted landings, Olivia Lynes told BBC News. ""It was really bumpy. It was like the worst rollercoaster turbulence you have, but you're trapped in a metal tube.
""It was swinging from side to side.""
The plane was then diverted and landed in Manchester, where she said passengers sat for three hours without information. Some passengers got off there but the flight then went on to try to land again at Stansted Airport but failed, and eventually flew back to Budapest getting in the early hours.
""It was awful. There was no information at any point, then it was 'just by the way we're half on the way to Budapest',"" she said.
""How am I going to get back I thought. We were supposed to be working today.""
Ms Lynes criticised Ryanair for the lack of communication and food offered. Eventually she managed to get on a Ryanair flight from Budapest to Stansted this morning.
She said that while ""you can't control the weather"" should would have expected ""a bit more humanity than we got"".
Ryanair said it ""sincerely apologises"" to passengers affected by the storm disruptions which were ""entirely beyond our control"".

Rhondda Cynon Taf council said this would save Â£495,000 a year, which would be put back into schools.
There will be a charge of Â£40-a-term for three days a week and Â£60-a-term for five days a week, despite hundreds of people opposing the plans.
The breakfast clubs themselves will remain free, and children entitled to free school meals will be exempt.
Only the first two children in a household that uses the service will have to be paid for.
The charge will come in at the start of 2024's spring term, or as soon as possible after.
Of 1,351 responses to a consultation on the matter 985 (73%) disagreed with the plan to introduce a charge while 254 (19%) agreed. A total of 106 (8%) said they didn't know.
Council leader Andrew Morgan said the two-child cap and making those eligible for free school meals exempt was the right thing to do.
He said the two-tier charge of Â£40 a term for three days a week and Â£60 a term for five days a week ""seems a lot fairer.""
The council is considering increasing the price of a range of its services, as part of a budget Mr Morgan described ""one of the most challenging"" he had been involved with.
The proposals include a 4.9% council tax hike, a rise which would bring in just over Â£1m.
Other possibilities include raising the price of meals on wheels and day service meals by 25p, from Â£4.55 to Â£4.80, and introducing a 25p fee for some bookings at Pontypridd Lido.

0NQRPE49UY_2GXKPM3JHRCEPMB,Mohammad Ghobadlou: Iran executes protester with mental health condition,By David Gritten,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68068233,"Iran has executed a man who was sentenced to death in connection with mass protests against the clerical establishment, the judiciary says.
Mohammad Ghobadlou, 23, was convicted of murder and ""corruption on Earth"" for allegedly running over a policeman with his car and killing him during a protest near Tehran in September 2022.
Rights groups said he faced an unfair trial marred by torture allegations.
Appeals to take into account his mental health condition were also rejected.
He is the ninth person to have been executed in relation to their involvement in the protests. At least four others are believed to be under sentence of death and 15 others are at risk of being handed the death penalty.
The nationwide unrest was triggered by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly wearing her hijab ""improperly"".
Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands detained in a violent crackdown by security forces, which have portrayed the protests as ""riots"".
The judiciary-run Mizan news agency said Mohammad Ghobadlou's death penalty was implemented on Tuesday morning, after being upheld by the Supreme Court.
Videos posted on social media showed members of his family - reportedly including his mother and aunt - crying out in anguish at the gates of Qazalhasar prison in Karaj, moments after he was hanged.
According to BBC Persian, one woman can be heard telling prison guards: ""You killed my Mohammed. He took to the streets for all of the young people.""
On Monday night, Ghobadlou's mother had made an emotional, videotaped appeal to the family of the policeman he was convicted of killing, asking them not to enforce the punishment of ""qisas"", or retribution in kind.
She had previously urged the judiciary to take into consideration that her son had been diagnosed bipolar disorder as a teenager and had stopped taking his medication two months before the protests, diminishing his responsibility.
Ghobadlou's lawyer, Amir Raesian, wrote on X on Monday evening that the execution would be illegal and amount to ""murder"". He argued that the Supreme Court had in July struck down the death sentence because of his client's mental health condition.
However, Mizan reported that Mr Raesian's claim was not true, saying the Supreme Court had twice rejected such appeals.
Amnesty International said last year that Ghobadlou had received two death sentences after ""grossly unfair sham trials marred by torture-tainted 'confessions' and failure to order rigorous mental health assessments despite his mental disability"".
According to information obtained by the human rights group, he was denied access to a lawyer by investigators following his arrest and that he was subjected to repeated beatings and not given his bipolar medication in order to force his ""confession"".
It said he was also denied an independently chosen lawyer at his trial before the Revolutionary Court, which consisted of two brief sessions in October and November 2022. At his two Criminal Court trial sessions that December, the lawyer he appointed was denied access to material evidence.
Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, director of the Norway-based group Iran Human Rights, denounced Ghobadlou's execution as ""an extrajudicial killing"".
""The Islamic Republic's leader Ali Khamenei and his judiciary must be held accountable for this crime,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
After learning on Monday that the execution was imminent, imprisoned human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi had called on Iranians to express their solidarity with Ghobadlou's family.
""The execution of Ghobadlou is a deliberate act of murder & a crime & in the face of murder, silence is betrayal,"" she wrote in a post on a Threads account run by relatives.
""Don't leave Mohammad's family alone. Let's stand with them tonight. Anyone in any way possible, shout: 'Do not execute!'""

Known as Mr Ibu, the 62-year-old had a leg amputated in November after fans had donated to a crowd-funding scheme.
His son Daniel Okafor and adopted daughter Jasmine Chioma are accused of hacking into his phone and taking $60,700 (Â£47,800) for themselves.
The pair have not commented since their arrest in the city of Lagos.
The police issued a statement about their arrest and their investigation into the alleged fraud after the siblings appeared at a bailing hearing on Thursday.
A court said the two could be freed if a $17,000 bond was posted. They remain in custody.
The police's criminal investigation unit said it had discovered that they had allegedly installed an app on their father's phone after the fund-raising began.
This allegedly enabled them to start transferring money out of his account.
They are expected to appear in court on 11 March for the next hearing.
Mr Ibu's health issues first came to public attention last October, when the family posted a video on social media of the Nollywood star celebrating in hospital. In the clip he asked his fans for help with medical bills, eliciting a huge response.
The actor became famous 20 years ago in the Nigerian comedy Mr Ibu - which became his nickname. It is still regarded as one of the best Nigerian performances in a comic role.
He went on to act in several other notable movies in Nollywood, as Nigeria's multi-billion-dollar film industry is known, in a career that has spanned more than two decades.
The star told a local newspaper a few years ago that he had a total of 13 children some of whom were adopted.

17UJP6TLH5_7UIJQXXHCFBBBIZ,New Hampshire primary: How did Joe Biden win despite not being on the ballot?,By Phil McCausland,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68077090,"President Joe Biden has easily won New Hampshire's Democratic primary, even though he was not on the ballot.
Enough voters wrote his name on their ballot papers, saving him the embarrassment of losing to Dean Phillips, a Democratic congressman.
Mr Biden skipped the primary because New Hampshire refused to move its vote, as ordered to by the Democratic National Committee (DNC).
South Carolina is officially first to vote in the primary race, next month.
The DNC decided to pick South Carolina as the first state to vote, because it said the southern state's diverse population was more reflective of the country. Both New Hampshire and Iowa, where the first Republican contest was held, have a higher percentage of white people than the average US state.
New Hampshire argued it would not move its primary, because it was bound by its state constitution to be first.
The DNC then stripped the state of its 24 delegates and Mr Biden did not register as a candidate, nor did he campaign in the state. Voting in primaries decides the number of delegates that in turn select the party's nominee at the national convention in August.
As the stand-off between New Hampshire and the national party went on, Mr Biden's supporters in the state organised a campaign for voters to put his name on the ballot, known as a write-in.
With 94% of votes in on Wednesday, Mr Biden had won 53% of the vote, far ahead of Mr Phillips on 19%.
Marianne Williamson, 71, an author and motivational speaker, garnered 4% of the vote, according to partial returns.
With Mr Biden off the official ballot, Mr Phillips, a Minnesota congressman, sought to cut into his lead.
Despite losing to the president in a landslide, Mr Phillips vowed to continue his campaign.
""I'm just afraid that Democrats are sleepwalking into disaster,"" the 55-year-old told the BBC. ""We did it in 2016. It is unforgivable and shameful to do the same thing knowingly this year.""
A moderate, Mr Phillips came to office in 2019. As the heir to his stepfather's Phillips Distilling Company empire, which owns major schnapps and liquor brands, he is one of the wealthiest members of Congress. He spent more than $5m on ads in the state, according to ad-tracking firm AdImpact. Mr Biden spent $156,000."

Victoria Poole says women's health is often ""put to the bottom of the list"" in Northern Ireland
A County Down woman has said not knowing where her case is in the ongoing review into cervical smears at the Southern Health Trust is adding to her distress.
Victoria Poole, 33, is one of 17,000 women who are affected by the review.
Thousands of women in NI are being recalled to attend for a repeat smear.
The Southern Trust has said it is working through cases as quickly as possible.
It is thought that thousands of slides will have to be re-checked.
To date, approximately 1,000 slides have been reviewed, with 800 of those women notified about their result.
Speaking to BBC News NI, Ms Poole said there had been no direct communication from the trust since a letter in October told her she was involved in the review.
The Southern Trust said it is in direct contact with women and provides numerous channels for communication, including a dedicated liaison support service and a free phone information line.
According to the trust, it prioritised cases thought to be most at risk.
The trust's medical director, Dr Stephen Austin, said while it was ""still early days"", so far a small number had revealed low grade abnormalities which is expected and not a concern.
He added there had been ""no high-grade abnormalities"" which were cases that could progress to cancer if left unchecked or untreated.
In July 2022, laboratory staff notified Southern Trust management that they had concerns about the performance of some screening staff.
The Royal College of Pathologists (RCPATH) were asked to carry out an independent assessment of the Trust's cervical screening service over 10 years.

What happens during a smear test?
It found that while most negative results were correct, a significant number of women were likely to have had negative screening results which would have been identified as potentially abnormal by other laboratories.
As a precautionary measure in October 2023 the Southern Trust announced a review of more than 17,000 women to double check that their previous smear result was correct.
Both the slide review and the repeat smear clinics are running simultaneously.
Tracey Bell, 44, has been invited to attend for a further smear test.
However, her request to have her smear history reviewed at the same time has been rejected.
Speaking about Mrs Bell's case, Dr Austin said women at this stage could not be part of the historic slide review as well as the smear test recall because at this stage they were trying to provide an outcome for every woman as soon as possible and a dual outcome would only slow the system down.
Dr Austin said those women who had been invited to attend for a new smear should do so as it would provide them with their most up to date cervical diagnosis.
He said he was not ruling out that in the future those women could access their smear slides but insisted at the moment it was either one or the other.
Mrs Bell, who also requested her cervical medical notes, said it was unsatisfactory that most of the information was redacted.
According to Dr Austin some information was redacted to protect the identity of the screeners who were involved in the review.
Mrs Bell said she was experiencing some symptoms which suggests there could be abnormalities and that's causing her concern.
She added that under those circumstances she wants her old slides reviewed as well as being given a new smear.
""I feel I have a right to know and to be given a full picture for peace of mind,"" she said.
Five members of her family have also received letters she said her biggest fear is that one of them is going to receive very bad news about their health.
""I have lost all faith in the system and feel let down. I feel the system wasn't working properly for 13 years and let all us women down.""
In December, Northern Ireland introduced primary HPV screening which tests the cervical cells for the HPV virus first.
It brought NI in line with the rest of the UK.
High risk HPV can cause cervical cells to become abnormal and potentially develop into cancer over time. .
Virtually all cases of cervical cancer are linked to high-risk HPV.
This newer HPV test is regarded as more accurate at detecting who is a higher risk of developing cervical cancer.
According to the Public Health Agency, the new process means women will get their results much quicker which will also help tackle the backlog of cervical smear tests.
Dr Tracy Owen, deputy Director at the PHA said the new system, which is a much better test also meant they are getting results out more quickly within a couple of weeks.
As well as the slide review repeat smear clinics are also running.
They began in November 2023 and the Southern Trust is continuing to contact women to offer appointment for repeat tests.
However according to the Trust uptake is ""disappointing"" as just 475 women have attended out of a potential 1,586 invited.
2016-2020
81 cases annually(On average)
21 deaths annually(On average)
The trust said while many smears were offered and booked, a very large number of women ""unfortunately"" did not attend their appointment.
Dr Austin said the trust still anticipated that a very small number of women would be adversely affected by what had happened.
Ms Poole said that was no consolation to the one or two women who may receive bad news.
Dr Austin said it was hoped the review would be completed and women informed by the end of June.
BBC News NI can also reveal that the Western Health Trust is now carrying out an ""external review of cytology slides"" that have been reported as serious adverse incidents (SAIs).
In October BBC News NI reported there had been 12 SAIs registered within the Western Health Trust since 2017 in relation to cervical screening.
In a letter from the Department of Health, and seen by the BBC, the permanent secretary at the Department of Health Peter May has written to the Social Democratic and Labour Party assembly member Mark H Durkan, who raised concerns about a number of cases, to say that an external review was being conducted by the cervical cytology service in Wales.
A spokesperson for the Western Health and Social Care Trust said that although the trust has had a higher number of cytology SAIs than other trusts, ""a recent unannounced inspection by UKAS [the United Kingdom Accreditation Schemes] stated the review of serious incidents reported showed due diligence by the laboratory in both reporting and recording keeping"".
""The laboratory are reporting SAIs at a higher threshold than the approved guidance, stating that 'this should be commended',"" the spokesperson added.
""As part of quality assurance checks, the Western Trust asked colleagues at a screening laboratory in Wales to carry out a peer review on the 12 SAIs reported. The purpose of this is to inform whether these are 'true' SAIs or if there has been some over-categorisation. This does not represent part of any wider review.""
The Department of Health said anyone who is concerned about potential signs of cervical cancer should contact their GP.
Signs and symptoms of cervical cancer can include:
New cervical cancer infection screening launched
17,500 cervical smear tests to be re-checked
Less than 2% of smear tests re-checked in review
Six month smear wait 'worrying and frustrating'"
1BS2V3FAWS_YCRAG7LRTZUGLR9,Measles vaccine campaign targets unprotected millions,By Philippa Roxby,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-68057317,"Millions of parents in England are being contacted by the NHS and urged to make an appointment to have their children vaccinated against measles, as cases rise across the country.
More than 3.4 million children aged under 16 are unprotected and at risk of becoming ill, NHS England says.
Areas with low uptake of the MMR vaccine, such as the West Midlands and London, are being targeted first.
A similar campaign last winter pushed up vaccinations by 10%.
UK health officials said last week that an outbreak of highly contagious measles in the West Midlands could spread rapidly in other towns and cities with low vaccination rates.
Dame Jenny Harries called for ""a call to action right across the country"" after hospitals in Birmingham reported a sharp rise in cases in children.
The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is given in two doses - the first around the age of one and the second when a child is about three years and four months old.
It is very effective at protecting against measles, but only 85% of children starting primary school in the UK have had both jabs - well below the target of 95% needed to stop it spreading.
In some cities, such as Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham and Nottingham, only 75% of five-year-olds are fully vaccinated, NHS figures show.
The current campaign will contact more than four million parents, carers and young adults by text, email or letter to tell them they or their children have missed out on one or both doses.
This includes more than one million children aged six to 11 across England, plus 330,000 11 to 16-year-olds and nearly one million 16 to 26-year-olds in London and the West Midlands.
Many young adults who were young children when a study falsely linked the vaccine and autism 25 years ago, are still unvaccinated.
Steve Russell, NHS England's director of vaccinations and screening, said the NHS was acting quickly to tackle the spread of measles.
""People who are unvaccinated can get catch-up jabs at MMR pop-ups in schools and other convenient places, while GPs, teachers and trusted community leaders are encouraging groups that are less likely to get their jab to come forward,"" he said.
One in five children with the disease are having to be admitted to hospital for treatment in Birmingham.
Babies who are too young to have their first dose, pregnant women and those who have weakened immune systems are most at risk from measles, which can be serious at any age.
During pregnancy, measles can lead to stillbirth, miscarriage and a baby being born small, so NHS England is encouraging young adults to catch up on missed doses too.
There are lots of different factors involved and experts say it is too easy to blame anti-vaccine attitudes.
With the NHS under huge pressure, child health experts say parents often struggle to get through to their GP and speak to the right staff to ask any questions they might have about the jab. Making a convenient appointment for their child during a busy working day can also be a challenge.
That is why head teachers in some areas are now working with the NHS to run clinics in schools, where children are.
Dr David Elliman, community paediatrician at Great Ormond Street Hospital, said parents' questions were understandable and they should be given time to talk to a trusted practice nurse, health visitor or GP for reassurance.
""There are very few parents who do not want their children immunised,"" he says.
However, there are those who were put off going to health centres during the pandemic for fear of catching Covid.
And there are also many parents who have not seen measles before, because it was nearly eliminated in the UK a few years ago.
""That means people forget about the dangers of it,"" says Prof Helen Bedford, child health expert from University College London.
Between one in 1,000 and one in 5,000 people who catch measles will die, so the worry is that there could be dozens of deaths from a disease that is easily preventable.
There are still some who believe the fake news around the MMR jab and autism, tied to a study from 25 years ago, which is known to be completely false.
Those myths have become worryingly embedded in some communities, health officials say.
The legacy of that study is that thousands of young adults in their 20s, who were born soon after it was published, missed out on vaccinations because of their parents' concerns at the time.

1D6EE5KNDT_1ECVOD5NWVURKD1,ExxonMobil sues investors to block climate petition,By Mariko Oi,7 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68052440,"Oil giant ExxonMobil has sued climate activist investors in a bid to prevent their climate proposal from going to a vote at its annual investor meeting.
The complaint is against Follow This and Arjuna Capital, which have called on Exxon to step up the pace of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
Exxon says the US and Dutch investors are driven by an ""extreme agenda"".
It is rare for companies to go to court to block shareholder motions and this is the first time Exxon has done so.
If the Texas-based firm wins the case, it would have a significant impact on future shareholder petitions.
Listed firms usually debate the merits of individual proposals with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
But critics say the US financial regulator varies its advice depending on which administration is in office.
For example, the number of motions by environmental activists has risen significantly in recent years, according to the SEC.
Follow This and Arjuna Capital want Exxon to set so-called Scope 3 targets to reduce emissions produced by users of its oil and gas.
Exxon currently aims to reach net zero by 2050 for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, which is the pollution from its production processes and the energy it consumes. However it is the only one of the five Western oil majors which does not have Scope 3 targets.
Exxon says the proposal by Follow This and Arjuna violates SEC rules for investor petitions.
The company has told the BBC that ""the breakdown of the shareholder proposal process, one that allows proponents to advance their agendas through a flood of proposals, does not serve the interests of investors"".
Exxon is asking a judge in the US district court in Texas to exclude the Scope 3 proposal by in its proxy statement.
The firm has asked for a decision by 19 March, in time for its annual shareholder meeting on 29 March.

1EYUJEKH3V_8UV9HM5HHBJYHJ0,Who could Donald Trump pick for vice-president if he wins nomination?,By Holly Honderich,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68064809,"Donald Trump hasn't won the Republican presidential nomination quite yet, but competition is already heating up for the number two spot on his ticket.
Allies and even some former rivals of the ex-president have started making regular appearances on the campaign trail, rallying support, pledging their loyalty and - seemingly - offering Mr Trump their auditions for vice-president.
Mr Trump himself has kept fairly quiet about his preferred candidate, saying on Fox News on Saturday there was ""no rush"" on his selection. ""It won't have any impact at all,"" he said.
""The person that I think I like is a very good person, pretty standard. I think people won't be that surprised, but I would say there's probably a 25% chance it would be that person,"" Mr Trump said.
While Mr Trump leaves us in the dark, here's a look at the possible Republicans who may be on the shortlist.
Near the top of the pack of the vice-presidential hopefuls is New York Representative Elise Stefanik.
Once a moderate, Trump-hesitant Republican, Ms Stefanik, 39, has drifted closer to the right wing of her party in recent years, growing into one of Mr Trump's most loyal defenders.
Now the highest-ranking woman among House Republicans, Ms Stefanik has also risen to modest conservative fame - first for her work on Mr Trump's first impeachment defence team in 2020 and, more recently, for her viral take-down of two Ivy League college presidents.
""Elise became very famous,"" Mr Trump told supporters last week of her contentious questioning of the college leaders. ""Wasn't it beautiful?""
Ms Stefanik certainly seems open to it, telling reports last weekend she would be ""honoured"" to serve in the Trump administration ""in any capacity"".
Tim Scott, an erstwhile competitor for the Republican nomination, is a senator and one of the most prominent black Republicans in the US.
He pitched himself as an optimistic conservative but his campaign failed to gain traction with voters. In November, after three lacklustre debate performances, he made a surprise exit from the race.
Mr Scott, 58, seemed to throw his hat in the vice-president (VP) ring this past weekend with his endorsement of Mr Trump - giving the cold shoulder to his fellow South Carolinian Nikki Haley, the woman who appointed him to the Senate in the first place.
But it was Mr Scott's rousing remarks at a Trump campaign rally on Friday that pushed his name firmly into the VP conversation. ""We need Donald Trump,"" Mr Scott told voters.
He then appeared on stage with Mr Trump during his New Hampshire victory speech on Tuesday evening, standing directly behind him in the television shot. At one point, he said to Mr Trump: ""I just love you."" The former president responded: ""That's why you're a great politician.""
JD Vance, 39, the junior senator from Ohio, was also in New Hampshire this past weekend, rallying support on behalf of Mr Trump.
A former venture capitalist, the Yale-educated Mr Vance first made headlines for his best-selling book Hillbilly Elegy, a memoir that followed his working class upbringing in the rust-belt Midwest.
Mr Vance, once a self-identified ""never-Trumper"", refashioned himself as a loyal disciple of Mr Trump when he launched his 2022 Senate bid. It paid off: Mr Trump's endorsement of Mr Vance gave his campaign a critical boost in both the crowded Republican primary and the general election.
Now in office, he has championed the hard-right issues that animate Mr Trump's base.
Mr Vance told reporters last week that he thought he could be better use to Mr Trump serving in the Senate for a second term. But doesn't seem to have ruled out a term as vice-president. ""I want to help him however I can,"" he said.
Kari Lake, a former TV anchor, gained a loyal following of Republican voters during her 2022 bid for Arizona governor, thanks to her camera-ready charisma and a devotion to Mr Trump's unfounded claims of election fraud in the 2020 election.
Ms Lake, 54, lost her election - a defeat she has refused to acknowledge - as well as a series of legal battles seeking to overturn the results of the Arizona race.
Late last year, Ms Lake announced would launch another campaign, this time for the US Senate.
She has remained one of Mr Trump's most energetic allies, making appearances for his campaign in both Iowa and New Hampshire.
So far, Ms Lake has said she plans to focus on her Senate run, but vowed she would ""crawl over broken glass"" to vote for Mr Trump and his eventual running mate - whoever that might be.
An alumnus of the Trump administration, Sarah Huckabee-Sanders, 41, served as White House press secretary for almost two years. She has been a reliable defender of the former president, praising his record and endorsing his current bid in November last year.
""The time has come to return to the normal policies of the Trump era which created a safer, stronger, and more prosperous America,"" Ms Sanders said at the time.
But while Ms Sanders appears to have maintained a friendly relationship with her former boss, so far she has hinted she is not interested in returning to the White House with him.
""Look, I absolutely love the job I have,"" she told CBS News last week. ""I think it's one of the best jobs I could ever ask for, and I am honoured to serve as governor, and I hope I get to do it for the next seven years.""

'Wigs gave me a sense of normality when I had cancer'
A cancer survivor and YouTuber says troll comments she received on social media about the wigs she wears made her feel ""tiny"".
In 2008, at the age of 17, Aimee Bannister was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, but was declared cancer free later that year.
Since receiving the all-clear she has continued to wear wigs even though her hair has grown back.
She said the wigs were now part of her identity.
""When I lost all of my hair I didn't recognise myself, I felt strange,"" said Ms Bannister, from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan.
""I didn't want people to look at me, and I didn't want anyone knowing. So I knew I needed a wig, and everything changed after that first one,"" Ms Bannister said.
""I do have hair now, I just couldn't grow it as fabulous as it is now, so I just love to wear wigs as they are now part of me, part of my identity.""
Replies left under a recent social media post include: ""Stupid wig, got something to hide?"" and ""Your wig is a joke"".
""I've been online for about 10 years and usually I don't get bad comments, which is why they hurt more when I do, and a lot are about the wigs,"" Ms Bannister said.
""They don't know my backstory, they don't know how hard I take those words.
""These people do make you feel tiny, they make you feel like you need to stop wearing wigs,"" she added.
Many people wear wigs while going through chemotherapy treatment for cancer, or after suffering from conditions like alopecia.
In Wales, the NHS provides wigs to patients through health boards, which make provision for their supply for people who meet their criteria. But wigs can also be bought.
""The prices of wigs that I buy can range from Â£35 to Â£700, it depends what budget you've got,"" she said.
Rebecca Morgan-Brennan, who owns Morgan's Hair, Beauty and Wigs, which has salons in Prestatyn, Chester and Cardiff, described the trolling as ""disgusting"".
Ms Morgan-Brennan said: ""It's barbaric that people think it's ok to comment about the way people look.
""People change their clothes every day, so why can't people change their hair every day?"" she said.
""It is a common thing, when people come to see me. Their main anxiety is how they're going to feel when they get reactions from people,"" she added.
Strictly Come Dancing star Amy Dowden has spoken about struggling with losing her hair to cancer treatment, admitting she could not bear looking in the mirror.
The reaction is something Ms Morgan-Brennan recognises.
""I hear of people that won't have a relationship with anyone because they've lost their hair,"" she said.
Her business was given an NHS contract in 2017, and her three salons now see about 60 clients a week.
Cerys Morris, counselling services manager at Tenovus Cancer Care, said: ""We are sorry to hear about Aimee's experience which must have been extremely traumatising for her on top her cancer diagnosis, treatment, and subsequent hair loss.
""Our counsellors work with the impact that hair loss due to treatment can have, the loss of self-esteem, the loss of identity.
""We work together with the person listening to the impact this has on relationships; it can sometimes increase anxiety and isolation.""

1HUN90LQSA_EGRKN48UPAQZF83,"Royal Blackburn Hospital: 'My dad, 80, spent 36 hours on corridor trolley'",By Lynette Horsburgh,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-68060190,"A woman has said she was ""horrified"" after her 80-year-old father with dementia spent 36 hours on a trolley in a hospital corridor after a fall.
Gail Myerscough said her dad, Brian, was taken by ambulance to Royal Blackburn Hospital's A&E department at about 14:00 GMT on Saturday.
She said dozens of patients were in the corridor with ""no privacy or dignity"".
East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust said staff were ""working as hard as they can to reduce waiting times"".
Ms Myerscough said it was ""very stressful and so upsetting"" to see her father who is from Blackburn in a corridor and looking ""so confused"" and she had been left ""traumatised"".
""I've never seen anything like it; I was horrified,"" the illustrator, from Manchester, said.
She said she had to change him in the corridor.
""He had no privacy or dignity and he couldn't sleep because it was so busy and there was nowhere for us to sit,"" she said.
Ms Myerscough added that the patients ""didn't get fed properly"" and were only offered pre-packed sandwiches.
She said ""several corridors"" were filled with patients on trolleys who looked ""in pain"".
The 52-year-old said she was ""really shocked"" to see a sign on her father's trolley which read ""corridor care"" and felt it was ""being normalised"".
""Something has to be done,"" she added.
Patients were warned last week that wait times at the hospital's accident and emergency department were more than 12 hours, due to a ""steep rise"" in people attending.
The trust said it was facing one of its busiest winters.
Sharon Gilligan, deputy chief executive at ELHT, added: ""It means the department is very crowded and many patients are having to wait over 12 hours which is not what any of us want.""
Ms Myerscough praised the staff who tried to help her dad, saying she could not fault them, but felt the hospital was ""under-staffed and under-resourced"".
""The staff did everything they could under difficult circumstances,"" she said.
Ms Myerscough said she was relieved when her father was finally placed in a ward in the early hours of Monday.
Ms Gilligan, who is also chief operating officer at the trust, said everyone was ""working as hard as they can to reduce waiting times"".
Apologising to everyone ""who finds themselves or their family waiting for long periods of time in our urgent or emergency care treatment centres"", she said the A&E department was one of the busiest in England.
""We are regularly breaking records for the number of people who come in for treatment each week and this includes a lot of very poorly people who need to be admitted for further care,"" she said.
""Unfortunately when all cubicles are full with patients, it does mean we need to use corridor space.
""Please be assured that whilst patients are waiting for a bed, they are being cared for, reviewed, assessed and supported by colleagues and we provide hot and cold drinks, soup and sandwiches to them.""
She said the team had shown ""ongoing hard work and resilience"" and could not be doing ""any more to support patients and their families in an extremely pressured and challenged environment"".
She added that people could help ""by only attending urgent or emergency centres if you have medical needs that are life-threatening"" and using the NHS 111 phoneline to be guided to the ""most appropriate place for help, including GP surgeries and pharmacies"".

1MYXBYBHRY_CKYALPNHNY8Y0L0,NI weather: Storm Jocelyn causes 'major disruption' to road network,_,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-68079158,"Storm Jocelyn has caused ""major disruption"" across the road network in Northern Ireland, a Department for Infrastructure official has said.
The main road to Belfast International Airport was closed on Tuesday evening due to the storm but reopened on Wednesday.
A yellow warning for wind ended on Wednesday morning.
""Since yesterday, the beginning of the storm, we have had over 200 additional reported incidents,"" Colin Sykes said.
The department's director of road maintenance added the impact had not been as widespread as Storm Isha.
However, ""coming on the back of the previous storm we still do have a number of obstructions across the road network and I would just ask people to be very careful if they are travelling this morning"".
High winds and fallen trees due to Storm Jocelyn resulted in a number of road closures on Tuesday evening, with some train journeys and flights also affected.
Jocelyn followed Storm Isha which blew in on Sunday causing power cuts that are still affecting 1,400 customers.
Power has already been restored to more than 52,000 customers since Sunday evening.
NIE Networks had estimated the number of customers affected by outages would rise again as Jocelyn brought strong winds over Tuesday night and into Wednesday.
The company said it would continue working to restore supplies where it is safe to do so.
Alex Houston of NIE Networks said it had 600 engineers ""out in the field"" and it would be able to bolster its service on Wednesday with a helicopter and more engineers from Great Britain.
""We are set up to work through to the end of the week, there will be a small number of customers who may be off until Friday, but we are doing everything in our power to bring in those additional resources to try and speed that up,"" he told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster.
He thanked customers for their ""patience and resilience"" and said work would continue ""until the last customer"" has power restored.
In the Republic of Ireland, about 19,000 homes and businesses remain without power.
Uisce Ãireann said reservoirs had run low due to power outages.
Storm Jocelyn was not expected to be as severe as Storm Isha and the highest gusts in both Northern Ireland and the Republic stood at 71mph.
The Met Office said following the impact of Storm Isha ""resilience is expected to be lower"", which could hamper ongoing recovery and repair efforts.
There could be further damage to buildings, power cuts, and disruption to transport, it said.
Some flights to and from George Best Belfast City Airport were cancelled on Tuesday.

BBC News NI weather presenter Barra Best explains how the naming system works and what some of the chosen names are.
Just two days after Storm Isha, Storm Jocelyn has brought another stormy night causing disruption with trees down and power outages in places again.
Highest gusts reached 71mph and Castlederg and Orlock Head.
Although the worst has passed there is still a risk of disruption, especially at first on Wednesday morning before the wind gradually moderates.
After that brief lull, the wind will still become a feature at times as head through the tail end of the week but thankfully nothing as strong.
Quite a windy day on Thursday, with rain at times, but mild.
Bright and breezy on Friday and after a colder start, a bit fresher as it will be for the weekend when it will be breezy and often cloudy but mainly dry until Sunday.
Damage to the roof of Titanic Belfast has also caused the visitor attraction to close on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The site's operations director Siobhan Lynch said pre-booked customers will be notified and refunded and has apologised for the inconvenience.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland reported it had 670 call-outs related to Storm Isha between 15:00 on Sunday and 03:00 on Monday.
In County Londonderry, a motorist died after a tree hit his car in Limavady.
Multiple trees, including three of the famous Dark Hedges beeches, were damaged in the storm leaving some roads impassable.
Storm Jocelyn, which has been named by Irish weather service Met Ãireann, is the 10th this season.
It was named after County Armagh-born astrophysicist Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell.
It is the first time there has been a storm beginning with J since Storm Jake in March 2016.

1NMKC02VUV_MUBLZPM0D7FSEFY,Donald Trump must pay E Jean Carroll $83.3m for defamation,By Brandon Livesay and Madeline Halpert,1 day ago,20230126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68109999,"This video can not be played
The BBC's Nada Tawfik explains why Trump must pay $83m to E Jean Carroll
A New York jury has decided Donald Trump should pay $83.3m (Â£65m) for defaming columnist E Jean Carroll in 2019 while he was US president.
The penalty in the civil trial is made up of $18.3m for compensatory damages and $65m in punitive damages.
Mr Trump was found in a previous civil case to have defamed Ms Carroll and sexually assaulted her in the 1990s.
He vowed to appeal the latest ruling, calling the case a witch hunt and the verdict ""absolutely ridiculous"".
In the latest trial, the jury was only required to decide how much compensation, if any, should be awarded to Ms Carroll.
The compensatory damages are meant to account for the harm that the jury found his comments had done to her reputation and emotional wellbeing.
The panel also had to come up with a punitive penalty intended to stop Mr Trump from continuing to speak out against her.
It took the jury of seven men and two women less than three hours to reach a verdict on Friday afternoon.
Mr Trump, who looks likely to be the Republican candidate in November's presidential election, also faces four criminal cases for a total of 91 felony counts.
He is the first president in US history to be charged with a crime, but has pleaded not guilty or denied all the charges.
""This is a great victory for every woman who stands up when she's been knocked down, and a huge defeat for every bully who has tried to keep a woman down,"" Ms Carroll said in a statement after the jury's decision on Friday.
Her attorney, Robbie Kaplan, said in a statement: ""Today's verdict proves that the law applies to everyone in our country, even the rich, even the famous, even former presidents.""
Mr Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, or even that he has ever met Ms Carroll, including on Friday morning.
But following the verdict he refrained from attacking her directly when he slammed the outcome of the case in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social.
""I fully disagree with both verdicts,"" he wrote, ""and will be appealing this whole Biden Directed Witch Hunt focused on me and the Republican Party.
""Our Legal System is out of control, and being used as a Political Weapon. They have taken away all First Amendment Rights. THIS IS NOT AMERICA!""
A civil trial last year found Mr Trump sexually assaulted Ms Carroll, a magazine columnist, in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in the 1990s.
That jury also found him liable for defamation for calling her accusations a lie - and he was ordered to pay her about $5m in damages.
The case that ended on Friday focused on different defamatory comments by Mr Trump in 2019.
Ms Carroll has yet to receive any money from Mr Trump.
The former president has paid a deposit to the court while the appeal process on the first defamation suit plays out, former federal prosecutor Mitch Epner said.
The same rules will apply to these much higher damages, Mr Epner added, where Mr Trump will have to put up an extra $83.3m - in either cash or an appeal bond - as a deposit.
Mr Trump, who abruptly left court earlier in the day with his Secret Service security detail, was not present to hear the verdict.
His departure came moments after Judge Kaplan threatened to jail Mr Trump's lawyer, Alina Habba, for continuing to speak after he had told her to be quiet.
""You are on the verge of spending some time in the lockup. Now sit down,"" he told Ms Habba.
The judge had threatened to eject Mr Trump earlier after he muttered about the case being a ""con job"" and a ""witch hunt"" in court. Before the verdict was read, the judge warned: ""We will haveÂ noÂ outbursts.""
During closing arguments earlier on Friday, a lawyer for Ms Carroll told the court her reputation had been severely harmed by the former president's comments denying he sexually assaulted her.
""This case is also about punishing Donald Trump... This trial is about getting him to stop once and for all,"" she said.
Ms Carroll's attorneys previously told the court that Mr Trump's statements unleashed a torrent of death threats, rape threats, and online vitriol towards her.
Mr Trump's lawyer had argued that he should pay no further damages to Ms Carroll as her claims have ""more holes than Swiss cheese"".
Ms Habba said that her client was not to blame for the threats that Ms Carroll received.
Earlier in the trial Judge Lewis Kaplan (no relation of the plaintiff's lawyer) advised jurors not to use their real names with each other due to the sensitive nature of the case.
As it concluded, he advised them that they were free to discuss their experience. But he added that in his opinion they should not tell anyone they worked on this case.
Mr Trump has repeatedly claimed the various legal cases he faces are being orchestrated by allies of US President Joe Biden, a Democrat.
As the Republican party's White House frontrunner, Mr Trump looks set for a rematch against Mr Biden in the November 2024 general election.

Watch: ""I just screamed"" - Nottingham victim's sister on hearing of killing
The son of Ian Coates, one of three people stabbed to death in Nottingham, said his father's killer was the ""most evil person on this planet"".
The school caretaker was killed along with students Barnaby Webber and Grace O'Malley-Kumar, both 19, on 13 June.
James Coates described Valdo Calocane as cold, calculated and brutal.
Calocane is being sentenced after pleading guilty to three counts of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility.
Mr Coates, 65, was driving his van in Magdala Road when he was repeatedly stabbed, suffering wounds to his abdomen and chest. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
Calocane has also admitted three counts of attempted murder after driving Mr Coates's van, which he had stolen, at three people following the killings.
Mr Coates worked at the Huntingdon Academy in Nottingham and was four months from retirement at the time of his death.
Speaking exclusively to the BBC, James Coates talked about his hatred for his father's killer.
""To me, he [Calocane] is the most evil person on this planet,"" the 38-year-old said.
""He went out and brutally massacred three people then attempted to kill another three.""
James added the catastrophic events of that day would have been something ""Nottingham or this country have never seen"", had Calocane not been caught.
His brother Lee, 37, said: ""The guy is a coward. He honed in on weak and vulnerable young students, weak and vulnerable old people.""
In a statement, Nottinghamshire Police's Assistant Chief Constable Rob Griffin said he had reviewed the force's involvement and found ""we should have done more to arrest"" Calocane prior to the killings.
Prosecutors accepted a plea of manslaughter from Calocane on the basis of diminished responsibility after he denied murder charges in November.
Calocane was suffering ""serious"" mental illness, Nottingham Crown Court has heard.
Prosecutor Karim Khalil said three psychiatrists had assessed Calocane, concluding that despite suffering paranoid schizophrenia, he would have understood the nature of his conduct in attacking three of his victims with a dagger described in court as ""a double-edged fighting knife"".
Mr Khalil said the families of the victims had been consulted before the prosecution decided to accept the pleas entered.
But the families of Ms O'Malley-Kumar and Mr Coates have expressed disappointment with the way the case concluded.
Lee added: ""The way this case has gone shows the flaws in the justice system because the evidence is there that it was calculated, pre-meditated and therefore should it be murder.
""I think it is disgusting. He has to spend the rest of his life behind bars, otherwise we have been let down by this country and the judicial system.""
Mr Coates's sister, Susan Coates, said: ""[Calocane] took three lives and attempted to take three others. However they term it, to me it wasn't manslaughter, he slaughtered and for that I can't forgive him.""
Paying tribute to her brother, the 68-year-old added: ""He was such a kind man and all he was doing was going to work.
""What he did leave was a legacy of love, a legacy of kindness. I am really proud that in the life he did have, he made a massive impact and that he impacted on everybody.""
The judge is due to hand down his sentence on Thursday.

1RDXFLKBZ2_P8WVY69H5F6XVFI,Asante Gold: UK to loan back Ghana's looted 'crown jewels',By Katie Razzall,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-68066877,"The UK is sending some of Ghana's ""crown jewels"" back home, 150 years after looting them from the court of the Asante king.
A gold peace pipe is among 32 items returning under long-term loan deals, the BBC can reveal.
The Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A) is lending 17 pieces and 15 are from the British Museum.
Ghana's chief negotiator said he hoped for ""a new sense of cultural co-operation"" after generations of anger.
Some national museums in the UK - including the V&A and the British Museum - are banned by law from permanently giving back contested items in their collections, and loan deals such as this are seen as a way to allow objects to return to their countries of origin.
But some countries laying claim to disputed artefacts fear that loans may be used to imply they accept the UK's ownership.
Tristram Hunt, director of the V&A, told the BBC that the gold items of court regalia are the equivalent of ""our Crown Jewels"".
The items to be loaned, most of which were taken during 19th-Century wars between the British and the Asante, include a sword of state and gold badges worn by officials charged with cleansing the soul of the king.
Mr Hunt said when museums hold ""objects with origins in war and looting in military campaigns, we have a responsibility to the countries of origin to think about how we can share those more fairly today.
""It doesn't seem to me that all of our museums will fall down if we build up these kind of partnerships and exchanges.""
However, Mr Hunt insisted the new cultural partnership ""is not restitution by the back door"" - meaning it is not a way to return permanent ownership back to Ghana.
The three-year loan agreements, with an option to extend for a further three years, are not with the Ghanaian government but with Otumfo Osei Tutu II - the current Asante king known as the Asantehene - who attended the Coronation of King Charles last year.
The Asantehene still holds an influential ceremonial role, although his kingdom is now part of Ghana's modern democracy.
The items will go on display at the Manhyia Palace Museum in Kumasi, the capital of the Asante region, to celebrate the Asantehene's silver jubilee.
The Asante gold artefacts are the ultimate symbol of the Asante royal government and are believed to be invested with the spirits of former Asante kings.
They have an importance to Ghana comparable to the Benin Bronzes - thousands of sculptures and plaques looted by Britain from the palace of the Kingdom of Benin, in modern-day southern Nigeria. Nigeria has been calling for their return for decades.
Nana Oforiatta Ayim, special adviser to Ghana's culture minister, told the BBC: ""They're not just objects, they have spiritual importance as well. They are part of the soul of the nation. It's pieces of ourselves returning.""
She said the loan was ""a good starting point"" on the anniversary of the looting and ""a sign of some kind of healing and commemoration for the violence that happened"".
UK museums hold many more items taken from Ghana, including a gold trophy head that is among the most famous pieces of Asante regalia.
The Asante built what was once one of the most powerful and formidable states in west Africa, trading in, among others, gold, textiles and enslaved people.
The kingdom was famed for its military might and wealth. Even now, when the Asantehene shakes hands on official occasions, he can be so weighed down with heavy gold bracelets that he sometimes has an aide whose job is to support his arm.
Europeans were attracted to what they later named the Gold Coast by the stories of African wealth and Britain fought repeated battles with the Asante in the 19th Century.
In 1874 after an Asante attack, British troops launched a ""punitive expedition"", in the colonial language of the time, ransacking Kumasi and taking many of the palace treasures.
Most of the items the V&A is returning were bought at an auction on 18 April 1874 at Garrards, the London jewellers who maintain the UK's Crown Jewels.
They include three heavy cast-gold items known as soul washers' badges (Akrafokonmu), which were worn around the necks of high ranking officials at court who were responsible for cleansing the soul of the king.
Angus Patterson, a senior curator at the V&A, said taking these items in the 19th Century ""was not simply about acquiring wealth, although that is a part of it. It's also about removing the symbols of government or the symbols of authority. It's a very political act"".
The British Museum is also returning on loan a total of 15 items, some of them looted during a later conflict in 1895-96, including a sword of state known as the Mpomponsuo.
There is also a ceremonial cap, known as a Denkyemke, richly decorated with gold ornaments. It was worn by senior courtiers at coronations and other major festivals.
The British Museum is also lending a cast-gold model lute-harp (Sankuo), which was not looted, to highlight its almost 200-year-old connection with the Asantehenes.
The sankuo was presented to the British writer and diplomat Thomas Bowdich in 1817, who said it was intended as a gift from the Asantehene to the museum to demonstrate the wealth and status of the Asante nation.
Can you loan objects back to a country that says you stole them?
It's a solution to UK legal restrictions that may not be acceptable to countries which say they want to right a historic wrong.
The issue of the Parthenon Sculptures, or Elgin Marbles as they were named in the UK, is the best-known example.
Greece has long demanded the return of these classical sculptures that are displayed in the British Museum. Its chair of trustees, George Osborne, recently said that he was looking for a ""practical, pragmatic and rational way forward"" and was exploring a partnership that, in essence, puts the question of who actually owns the classical sculptures to one side.
This agreement with the Asantehene is another version of that; a compromise that works for the Asante king and is possible within the parameters of British law.
Just as Nigeria would be unlikely to accept a loan of the Benin Bronzes, it would have been difficult for Ghana's government to accept this kind of agreement.
But Mr Hunt said the deals between the V&A, the British Museum and the Manhyia Palace Museum ""cut through the politics. It doesn't solve the problem, but it begins the conversation"".
Ms Oforiatta Ayim, the Ghana culture minister's adviser, said ""of course"" people will be angry at the idea of a loan and they hoped to see items eventually returned permanently to Ghana.
""We know the objects were stolen in violent circumstances, we know the items belong to the Asante people,"" she said.
The British government has a ""retain and explain"" stance for state-owned institutions, which means contested objects are kept and their context is explained.
Neither the Conservative nor Labour parties have signalled any interest in changing current legislation. The British Museum Act of 1963 and the National Heritage Act of 1983 prevent museum trustees at some high-profile institutions from ""deaccessioning"" items in their collections.
Mr Hunt is advocating a change in the law. He would like to see ""more freedom for museums, but then a kind of backstop, a committee where we would have to appeal if we wanted to restitute items"".
Some have raised concerns this would mean British museums losing some of their most prized items in future. Or as a previous culture secretary, Michelle Donelan, put it to me in relation to a return of the Parthenon Sculptures, that it would ""open the gateway to the question of the entire contents of our museums"".
But Mr Hunt said the ownership of very few of the V&A's collection of 2.8 million items has been disputed.
Another fear is that contested items that go on loan will never be returned.
Ghana's chief negotiator Ivor Agyeman-Duah scotched that. ""You stick to agreements that you have, you don't go against them,"" he said.
There are other beautiful Asante gold items in the UK. The Wallace Collection includes the trophy head which is among the most famous Asante treasures. It too was taken by British forces and bought at the 1874 auction.
The Royal Collection also holds objects including another gold trophy head in the form of a mask. This type of item represented defeated enemies; the trophies were attached by a hoop to ceremonial swords in the state regalia.
Will they ever be on show in Ghana in future? Mr Agyeman-Duah is taking it one step at a time.
But as Britain is increasingly confronting the cultural legacy of its colonial past, these types of agreements may be a diplomatic and practical way to address the past and create better relationships in the future - if both sides can accept the terms.

1T7JCOHAQM_V48CXIGEFRAD4P2,Tahir Ali: Labour MP apologises over PM 'blood on hands' remark,_,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68086232,"This video can not be played
Watch Labour MP's question to Rishi Sunak at Prime Minister's Questions
A Labour MP has apologised after saying Rishi Sunak had ""the blood of thousands of innocent people on his hands"" over the Israel-Gaza conflict.
Tahir Ali made the comment in Parliament, as he challenged the prime minister about the UK's stance on the war.
He apologised shortly afterwards, after being asked to do so by Labour's chief whip.
But he added he did not ""resile from my strongly held views"" on the conflict.
In a social media post, Mr Ali, the MP for Birmingham Hall Green, said he was sorry for ""the way in which I described"" Mr Sunak in his question.
The Labour leadership has publicly distanced itself from his remarks, with a party spokesman telling reporters they were ""clearly inappropriate"".
Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Ali said ""recently released documents"" revealed the Foreign Office had concerns over Israel's compliance with international humanitarian law in its ongoing military campaign in Gaza.
It appeared to be a reference to documents that have emerged as part of a legal challenge to the business department's decision to continue arms export licences to Israel.
The Guardian reported last week that an internal Foreign Office assessment in late November had raised concerns over Israel's bombing campaign, and how it was deciding whether to grant access to aid workers.
The licences were eventually continued after Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron advised they should, but be kept under review.
Mr Ali said the documents had been ""hidden from Parliament"" whilst Mr Sunak had ""boldly stated his confidence in Israel's respect for international law"".
He added that South Africa's case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which alleges Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians, had revealed ""the scale of Israel's war crimes in Gaza"".
""Is it now not the time for the prime minister to admit that he has the blood of thousands of innocent people on his hands, and for him to commit to demanding an immediate ceasefire and an ending of UK's arms trade with Israel?"" he asked.
But in a post three hours later on X, formerly Twitter, he issued an apology over his intervention. It is understood Labour's chief whip Sir Alan Campbell spoke to him after PMQs and asked him to apologise.
Mr Ali added: ""While I do not resile from my strongly held views on the situation in the Middle East, I would like to apologise for the way in which I described the prime minister in my question"".
""We all have a responsibility to be respectful in the language that we use, even when discussing difficult and, at times, sensitive issues.""
Israel launched its bombing and ground offensive in Gaza with the declared aim of destroying Hamas, after its gunmen killed 1,300 people - mostly civilians - and took about 250 others hostage in an unprecedented attack in October.
At least 25,700 people have been killed in the Israeli military campaign in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

1TKAL9TGHE_ILTF8Y1H12D8PWP,Australia: 'Golden visa' scheme for wealthy investors axed,By Hannah Ritchie,7 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-68052626,"Australia has axed its so-called ""golden visa"", which granted wealthy overseas investors the right to live in the country.
Designed to attract foreign business, it was cut in an immigration overhaul after the government found it was ""delivering poor economic outcomes"".
Critics have long argued that the scheme was being used by ""corrupt officials"" to ""park illicit funds"".
It will be replaced with more skilled-worker visas.
Thousands of significant investor visas (SIV) have been granted through the program since 2012, with 85% of successful applicants coming from China according to government data.
Marketed as a way to drive foreign investment and stoke innovation, candidates had to invest more than A$5m (Â£2.6m;$3.3m) in Australia to be eligible.
After multiple reviews, the government found that the scheme had failed to meet its core objectives. In a policy document from December, it announced that it would scrap it, focusing instead on creating more visas for ""skilled migrants"" capable ""of making outsized contributions to Australia"".
""It has been obvious for years that this visa is not delivering what our country and economy needs,"" Minister for Home Affairs Clare O'Neil said in a statement on Monday.
The move has been welcomed by Clancy Moore, the chief executive of Transparency International Australia, who told the BBC: ""For far too long corrupt officials and kleptocrats have used golden visas as a vehicle to park their illicit funds in Australia and arguably hide their proceeds of crime.""
The program had already come under intense scrutiny for its alleged ""loopholes"" and ""vulnerabilities"". Bill Browder, who is widely credited as being responsible for the creation of the Magnitsky Act - a US law designed to target individuals for abuses committed overseas, has also criticised the scheme.
In 2016, a government inquiry raised concerns that it had the ""potential for money laundering and other nefarious activities"", while in 2022 The Australian newspaper reported that members of Cambodia's Hun Sen regime were among the bad actors who had exploited the system.
The government inquiry also found that the visas were bringing people into Australia with ""less business acumen"" than would have otherwise arrived, while offering tax concessions that were costing the public.
Some asset managers have pushed back on those assessments, arguing that the follow-on investment from SIVs has ended up being significantly more than the A$5m buy in.
Australia now joins the UK, which scrapped a scheme offering fast-track residency to the mega rich in 2022, due to concerns about the inflow of illicit Russian money.
So-called golden visa schemes have also come under scrutiny in Malta, which has been granting speedy citizenship to wealthy non-European Union nationals. In 2022, an investigation discovered the visas being granted after people spent just days in the island nation, while the EU had raised concern over risks of money laundering, tax evasion and corruption.

Harri, five, spends his free time after school reading to residents in Pendine Park's Highfield care home in Wrexham.
His mum Laura said it was his love of reading that inspired her to bring the book fanatic to the care home where she works.
Harri has become a firm favourite among residents and his mum said their faces ""light up"" when he arrives.
Laura, a senior care practitioner at Highfield, added: ""Staff also have got to know him well and always shout out 'hello Harri' on his arrival.
""They all know him and enjoy hearing how well he is progressing with his reading.""
Harri added: ""It's great. I like to make them smile and it's nice when they help me if I get stuck on anything.""
Harri's favourite books are the Biff, Chip and Kipper series of adventures.
Resident Betty Newcombe - one of Harri's new friends - said his visits were a highlight in the home.
""Seeing him walk into the room always brightens up an afternoon. He is very clever and an excellent reader, considering his young age.""
Highfield manager Tracey Smith described Harri as a ""little ray of sunshine"".
""He's a very charming little boy and he has melted the hearts of the residents and staff alike,"" she said.
Laura has since reached out to teachers at Harri's school to arrange for pupils to visit the care home.
She said: ""It's always a good idea bringing older and younger generations together. They easily enjoy each other's company and can learn so much from each other.""

Greater Manchester Police said a 30-year-old man died in hospital after being attacked when the cars stopped at lights on the A34, Kingsway, in Manchester at about 01:40 GMT.
An 18-year-old man been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Det Insp Alex Wilkinson said the motive for the attack was ""not clear"".
A force representative said the man who died and his attacker were ""travelling in separate vehicles along Kingsway"" before the attack between the Parrs Wood Lane and Queensway junctions.
They said the man was taken to hospital but died from his injuries a short time later.
They said his attacker did not stop at the scene and left ""in their vehicle"".
""Following an immediate investigation and extensive enquiries, an 18-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody for questioning,"" they added.
Det Insp Wilkinson said an ""incident of such seriousness"" would cause ""shock to the local community and further afield"", but an investigation had been launched ""to understand what has happened fully and identify all those responsible swiftly"".
""Whilst the motive for this murder is not clear at this stage, we do believe the incident to be isolated,"" he added.
The attack led to the road, a major commuter route into the city, being closed by police to allow an investigation to take place.
As a result, rush hour traffic was severely impacted.
Bus services around the East Didsbury area have been delayed by about 60 minutes, but the tram stop close to the incident remains open.
Det Insp Wilkinson said the road closure would remain in place for several hours and urged road users to show ""patience"".
""I appreciate the road closures in place are impactful on people's travel, particularly for those going to and from work or school on this route, but would ask the public for their patience and understanding,"" he said.
Urging anyone with information about the attack to get in touch, he said the force's thoughts were ""with the victim's family who have been woken up to such tragic news this morning"".
""They are being supported and have asked for privacy whilst they come to terms with what has happened,"" he added.

2BP24IUBZ5_DIW68LPRSOXYSY9,Zambia mine: Chinese nationals among miners trapped in flooded shaft,By Wycliffe Muia,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-68053674,"Seven miners, including two Chinese nationals, have been trapped in a flooded mine in Zambia's Copperbelt province since Monday.
They were among staff working at the Chinese-owned Macrolink copper mine in Ndola city, near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The miners were trapped underground after water entered the mine, which is still under construction.
The Chinese embassy in Zambia said it was mobilising rescue specialists.
Macrolink had temporarily suspended operations at the mine, Zambia's state broadcaster reported.
The incident comes barely a month after landslides buried dozens of other miners at Seseli Mine in Chingola, about 400 km (250 miles) north-west of the capital, Lusaka.
The fate of around 30 miners who went missing in the mudslide remains unknown after emergency services were unable to locate them.
Augustine Kasongo, a senior government official in Copperbelt province, said one person had so far been rescued from the mine that flooded on Monday, local media reported.
Rescue teams are trying to pump out water from the mine. Reports say the seven are trapped about 235m (771ft) below the surface.
The two Chinese trapped are the mine supervisor and a controller, while the five Zambians are said to be staff who were working at the shaft bottom of the mine, according to local media.
In a statement, the Chinese embassy said it was providing ""dewatering equipment and other necessary assistance, to complement the efforts of the Zambian authorities"".
Zambia is among the world's top copper producers. A significant number of its mines are run by foreigners.
Last week, President Hakainde Hichilema said new stringent laws would be introduced to regulate the industry and to stop Zambians from selling mining licences to foreigners.

He made a flying visit to the capital two years before his iconic ""I have a dream"" speech.
Camden Council and the Nubian Jak Community Trust collaborated on the plaque, which is also the first to be put on a place of worship.
The event was attended by the US ambassador to the UK, Jane Hartley, who said the world needs Dr King's message today as much as then.
The 1961 sermon urged people to live lives of ""equal length, breadth, and height"".
A ""long"" life was one where a person's talents are developed to the full, a ""broad"" life had a concern for the welfare of others, and a life of ""height"" recognised the need for God as the pinnacle of a complete life.

2O98H8GS8I_E0VI4EGFH8QUVEQ,Iraq condemns 'irresponsible' US air strikes on Iran-backed groups,By Lipika Pelham,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68077560,"The Iraqi government has strongly condemned US strikes which targeted sites used by Iranian-backed groups in Iraq on Wednesday.
A spokesperson for Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said they ""blatantly"" violated his country's sovereignty.
The US said its ""proportionate"" attacks had targeted ""Iran-affiliated groups"".
The paramilitary Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) said the ""treacherous"" US action killed one of their fighters.
The PMF, which is dominated by Iran-backed Shia Muslim militias, said a number of other fighters were injured in strikes on their bases in al-Qaim, a town on the Syrian border in western Anbar province, and in Jurf al-Nasr, in the central province of Babil.
US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said the strikes on three facilities belonging to the Kataib Hezbollah militia and other groups were ""in direct response to a series of escalatory attacks"" against US and other international forces in Iraq and Syria.
Major General Yehia Rasool, a spokesman for Prime Minister Sudani, said in a statement that the US action was ""contributing to a reckless escalation"".
""This unacceptable act undermines years of co-operation... at a time when the region is already grappling with the danger of expanding conflict, the repercussions of the aggression on Gaza,"" he added, referring to the war between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas.
He added that Iraq would treat the US operations ""as acts of aggression"" against its people on their land, and urged the international community to help restore peace.
Writing on X, formerly Twitter, Iraq national security adviser Qassem al-Aaraji said the US action would ""not help bring calm"".
He added that ""the US should pile on pressure for a halt to the Israeli offensive in Gaza rather than targeting and bombing the bases of an Iraqi national body"".
Last week, four US military personnel were injured in a ballistic missile and rocket attack on Iraq's Al Asad air base, in Anbar province.
The Pentagon said on Tuesday that they had returned to duty and that there was no significant damage to facilities.
The US military's Central Command (Centcom) said an Iran-backed militia targeted the air base, which hosts American troops.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed it was behind that attack.
The umbrella group emerged in late 2023 and is comprised of several Iran-affiliated militias operating in Iraq. It has claimed other attacks against US forces in recent weeks.
Mr Austin said: ""We do not seek to escalate conflict in the region. We are fully prepared to take further measures to protect our people and our facilities.""
""We call on these groups and their Iranian sponsors to immediately cease these attacks.""
In a separate statement, Centcom said the strikes were carried out at 00:15 local time on Wednesday (21:15 GMT Tuesday).
""These strikes targeted [Kataib Hezbollah] headquarters, storage, and training locations for rocket, missile, and one-way attack UAV capabilities,"" it added, without mentioning their locations.
Kataib Hezbollah, or Brigades of the Party of God, is a powerful Iraqi Shia militia that receives financial and military support from Iran.
It is believed to have strong links with Iran's Quds Force, the overseas operations arm of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps.
Since 2009, the US has designated the group as a terrorist organisation, accusing it of attacking US and Iraqi forces in Iraq on behalf of Iran, and of threatening Iraq's stability.
Saturday's attack on Al Asad air base followed a US drone strike in Baghdad earlier this month in which a high-ranking PMF commander was killed.
US troops in Iraq and Syria have been attacked dozens of times by Iran-aligned fighters since the war in Gaza started in October.
The US and UK have also carried out strikes on Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi movement in response to its missile and drone attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.
Meanwhile, Iran has carried out a number of missile strikes over the last week against targets in Syria, Iraq and Pakistan, which it claimed were linked to the Islamic State group, Israel and a Baloch separatist group respectively.
Last Saturday, Iran accused Israel of carrying out an air strike in the Syrian capital, Damascus, which killed five senior members of Iran's security forces.

Two-year-old Boer goats Pickle and Pepper were stolen overnight on Monday from the Bridport area of west Dorset.
They were found loose in the road in Charles Lane, Ringwood, the next day by officers after they stopped a vehicle on the A31 in St Leonards.
The teenage driver and two men from Poole were arrested on suspicion of stealing the goats.
Dorset Police said the teenager had since been released on bail.
Officers said they had arrested the same two men at an unauthorised encampment in Yarmouth Road in Poole earlier the same day on suspicion of theft over another pair of snatched goats.
Pygmy goats Margoat and Robbie were taken on 11 January from the Marshwood area of west Dorset.
The eight-month-old family pets were found two days later in Yeovil, Somerset, and returned to their owner.
Both men have since been released on police bail over the thefts of both sets of goats as officers from the Dorset Police Rural Crime Team continue their investigation.

32EBC6MP4G_44VJMQB9RYK8YAD,Elon Musk visits site of Auschwitz death camp,By Shiona McCallum & Chris Vallance,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68055368,"Tech billionaire Elon Musk has visited the site of the Auschwitz death camp.
The visit comes after intense criticism of how X, formerly Twitter, tackles antisemitic posts and just weeks after Mr Musk apologised for endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory.
Prominent Jewish leaders called for Mr Musk to see for himself one of the most symbolic sites of the Holocaust.
Later he will address online antisemitism at a conference hosted by the European Jewish Association (EJA).
Nazi Germany murdered at least 1.1 million people in the Auschwitz death camp in occupied Poland during World War Two. Almost one million were Jews. The museum notes more than 200,000 were children and young people.
Mr Musk laid a wreath and participated in a memorial service, including lighting a candle, during a private visit to the site.
Photos showed him there with his son on his shoulders and standing next to Holocaust survivor Gidon Lev.
As a result of the fall-out over Mr Musk's enthusiastic agreement with an antisemitic post, Apple, Disney and IBM paused ads on X.
In response, the entrepreneur has accused advertisers of attempting to ""blackmail"" him with money, and used expletive filled language to express his disdain for their actions.
The Tesla boss, who took over the platform in October 2022, faced accusations of antisemitism in November when he replied, ""You have said the actual truth"" to a post on X that made the false claim that Jewish communities push hatred against white people.
The White House immediately condemned his post, which drew anger online.
Mr Musk said the endorsement was a mistake, describing it as ""one of the most foolish"" things he had done on the platform.
Later in November Mr Musk joined Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a tour of the Kfar Aza kibbutz targeted by Hamas as part of the 7 October attacks in which 1,300 people were killed and about 240 taken back to Gaza as hostages.
Today, senior political figures from European countries and Mr Musk will meet in Krakow, Poland ""to discuss and find solutions to the astronomical rises in antisemitism affecting Europe,"" the EJA said.
""This troubling trend"" had been escalating since the war in Gaza, it said.
During a live discussion broadcast on X in September, EJA chairman Rabbi Menachem Margolin invited Mr Musk to visit Auschwitz.
Rabbi Margolin said it would be ""a very strong statement"" and ""could contribute a lot to Holocaust awareness and the struggle to combat antisemitism"".
They were gassed, starved, worked to death and killed in medical experiments.
The Memorial and Museum Auschwitz-Birkenau has previously been critical of X.
In August, the museum criticised the platform after it had initially failed to remove a post denying the Holocaust, saying it did not break its rules.
The offensive post was a reply to one from the museum about a three-year-old Jewish girl murdered in the camp's gas chambers.
The post called her death a ""fairy tale"" and used antisemitic tropes.
According to a post on X by the museum, it had reported the offensive reply but received a response saying that after viewing the ""available information"" the platform had decided no rules had been broken.
That initial response to the museum's complaint, according to X, was down to a mistake during the first review - it was escalated and removed in a second review.
X's policies state that Holocaust denial is prohibited.
Shortly after publication of an article about the incident, a museum spokesperson told the BBC that moderation was vital in tackling antisemitism but there seemed to be ""a problem on X in the quality of moderating and responding to reports"".
But the Tesla boss has strongly defended his record in combating online hate.
In his discussion with Rabbi Margolin, Mr Musk said it was absurd that he was accused of antisemitism ""when all the evidence points the other direction and my entire life story is in fact pro-semitic.""
He previously threatened to file a suit against the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy group, over its claims that problematic and racist speech has soared on the site since his takeover.
X is also currently suing non-profit Media Matters after it accused the site of allowing antisemitic posts next to advertising. X's lawsuit alleges it used ""manipulated"" data in an attempt to ""destroy"" the platform.

The landslide in Zhaotong occurred at 05:51 local time (21:51 GMT) on Monday, trapping dozens of people.
Rescuers are racing against time and working through sub-zero temperatures to find those still missing, state news agency Xinhua said.
Preliminary investigations show the landslide resulted from a collapse in a steep cliff, it reported.
The collapsed mass measured approximately 100m (328ft) in width, 60m in height, with an average thickness of around 6m, Xinhua said, citing city authorities.
More than 500 people were evacuated from their homes and nearly 1,000 rescue workers dispatched to the site. President Xi Jinping has ordered an ""all-out"" rescue in the area, while Chinese vice-premier Zhang Guoqing reportedly led a group to the site to guide rescue operations.
""Search and rescue efforts persisted through the night,"" firefighter Li Shenglong told state news outlet Xinhua.
One of the villagers told local media that most of the residents were either elderly or children. Another resident told local news outlet Jimu News that the landslide happened while many people were still asleep on Monday morning.
""It was very loud, and there was also a shake, it felt like a big earthquake,"" she said.
Video clips shared on social media showed rescuers walking on piles of rubble against a backdrop of snow-covered mountains. Personal belongings are seen scattered among the collapsed masonry.
The remote, mountainous region in southwest China is prone to landslides. In January 2013, at least 18 people were killed in a landslide in the same county.
Separately, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit Wushi county in China's Xinjiang at about 02:00 local time on Tuesday. State broadcaster CCTV said no casualties have been reported, but some homes have been damaged and some areas had their power supplies cut.

37AQ1SBR0F_4PJHAGGN0LQ38PL,French protests: Female farmer and daughter killed as car hits French protesters,By Chris Bockman in Toulouse & Paul Kirby in London,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68066310,"A French farmer in her thirties and her 12-year-old daughter have died after a car crashed into a roadblock during a nationwide protest by French farmers.
The accident, which left the farmer's husband badly injured, happened an hour south of Toulouse as the protest grew.
Farmers have cut off key roads for days in the south-west, one of France's most important agricultural regions.
Early indications suggested the accident was not deliberate, the local prosecutor said.
Agriculture Minister Marc Fesneau said it was a ""tragedy for all of us"".
Tuesday's accident came as farmers across France expanded their roadblocks after a meeting with Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, to address complaints about new environmental regulations and rising energy costs.
Public prosecutors said the car ""struck bales of straw and mowed down three people"" while driving on a stretch of dual carriageway on the main N20 national route at Pamiers 70km (43 miles) south of Toulouse, while it was still dark at around 05:45 (04:45GMT) on Tuesday morning.
The farmer who died was named as Alexandra Sonac, 35, who bred cattle and grew corn on a farm in the nearby village of Saint-Felix-de-Tournegat.
Her 12-year-old daughter later died of her injuries in hospital. The farmer's husband, who is 40, is being treated in intensive care.
The three people in the car were all detained. They had reportedly been driving from Toulouse to Andorra, another two hours' drive to the south.
An investigation has been opened into aggravated manslaughter although local prosecutor Olivier Mouysset said the incident did not appear to be deliberate.
The young farmer who died was a member of the main FNSEA farmers' union, whose president Arnaud Rousseau said that ""in this particular moment that [French] agriculture is dealing with, this kind of tragedy is difficult to cope with"".
""I'd like to tell the people on the ground first of all that they have the full support of French farmers.""
Ms Sonac, who had two children, told a local radio station earlier this week that her family was protesting to defend their profession.
""I've got two girls to look after and we live for them. We don't go on holiday, we don't get a day off,"" she told Radio Transparence.
As the farmers' protests spread across France, the head of the Jeunes Agriculteurs (Young Farmers) union, Arnaud Gaillot, said he had never seen such widespread determination.
""If necessary we'll blockade Paris... some [of our members] have nothing else to lose, their survival is at stake,"" he told RTL radio.
Tractors and lorries blocked the A7 motorway in south-east France, with the slogan ""we're dying to feed you"" daubed in red on one of the vehicles.
The most recent protests started in the south-west last week. Although it is one of the most important agricultural regions in the country, the FNSEA says farmers in this part of France have the lowest incomes within the profession.
They are already being nicknamed ""gilets verts"", or green jackets - a reference to the broader gilets jaunes civil protests that swept across France over rising fuel prices.
More than 400 tractors last week blocked the centre of Toulouse, home to around 800,000 people. Over recent days, several key motorways in the south west have been cut off entirely by farmers who have installed sleeping quarters in the middle of the highways.
Motorways were cut off on Tuesday between Toulouse and the Basque Country and Toulouse and Bordeaux. On Wednesday morning taxi drivers in Toulouse joined the strike in a show of support for the farmers.
Aware of how politically sensitive the situation is, the French interior minister said on Monday he would not order police to break up the blockades.
Prime Minister Gabriel Attal responded to news of the accident on Tuesday by paying tribute to the family and friends of those involved in the accident. The nation was ""overwhelmed and united"" and all of France's farmers were in mourning, he said on social media.

While details of her new role are unclear, she will continue official duties with the imperial family.
The 22-year-old princess is not in line of succession as Japanese law allows only men to ascend to the throne.
Japan has the oldest continuing hereditary monarchy in the world.
In a statement, Princess Aiko said that she has ""always had an interest"" in the Red Cross, while her new employer added that it wants ""to thoroughly make preparations so that the princess can work at ease"".
The organisation has close ties with the imperial family, with previous empresses serving as honorary presidents.
In October, Princess Aiko visited the society with her parents to observe an exhibition on its relief activities following the 1923 Tokyo earthquake. In recent years, she has also expressed her sympathies to victims and survivors of natural disasters in Japan.
She is currently in her final year of study at Gakushuin University's Faculty of Letters, majoring in Japanese language and literature. The princess is generally well regarded by the Japanese public, many of whom have welcomed her new role.
Princess Aiko's mother, Empress Masako, is known as a ""career woman"" princess and empress in Japan.
Educated at Harvard and Oxford, the empress is a former diplomat fluent in several languages.
In 1993, she became only the second commoner, after former Empress Michiko, to marry the first in line to the Japanese throne.
But once married, speculation raged over if and when she would produce a male heir.

From 2019 - An explainer on why Princess Aiko, the only child of Japan's Crown Prince Naruhito, will not ascend the throne because she is female
The birth of Princess Aiko in 2001 was much celebrated but did not resolve the succession issue.
The Japanese government then began debating whether to change the law to allow women to ascend to the throne.
Five years later, Emperor Naruhito's younger brother welcomed a baby boy, Prince Hisahito, to avert the succession crisis.
But the pressure on then Crown Princess Masako was evident as she disappeared from public view for more than a decade.
In 2004, then Crown Prince Naruhito told journalists in unusually strong comments that his wife had ""completely exhausted herself"" trying to adapt to palace life.
The palace then announced that the princess was suffering from an ""adjustment disorder"", widely assumed to be a reference to depression.
In recent years, the family of Prince Hisahito, who is second in line to the throne after his father, has attracted much coverage by Japanese tabloids.
His older sister, former princess Mako, married a commoner, Kei Komuro, and moved to the US after leaving the imperial family.
An alleged money dispute between Mr Komuro's mother and her former fiancÃ©, who claimed mother and son had failed to repay a debt to him, almost threatened their marriage as public perception of the couple soured.
Mr Komuro's New York state bar exam results were treated as breaking news in Japan until he passed on his third try in 2022.
The tabloid spotlight on the Akishino family has meant that local media often makes comparisons between the princesses.
When Princess Aiko was asked about her cousin Mako's marriage in 2022, she said: ""For me, marriage still seems far in the future and I haven't really thought of it. I have no particular thought of my ideal partner, but (the ability to) make each other smile seems perfect.""

3Z0XMWOU3E_KEKMHVBXDRUZH56,"Russia risked lives in downed plane, Volodymyr Zelensky says",By Laura Gozzi & Paul Kirby,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68083739,"This video can not be played
The BBC has verified this video showing the moment a Russian aircraft crashed in the Belgorod region
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Moscow of ""playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners"", after a deadly plane crash in western Russia.
He demanded an international inquiry after Wednesday's crash in the Belgorod region near Ukraine's border.
Russia said there were no survivors after Kyiv had downed the Il-76 plane with 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war, six Russian crew and three escorts.
Moscow claimed the Ukrainians were being flown for a prisoner exchange.
Ukraine's military intelligence (GUR) said it had not been told to ensure safe airspace, as on previous occasions.
The GUR comments have been seen as a tacit acknowledgement that Ukraine shot the military transport plane down, although it stressed it had no reliable information about who was on board and warned the incident may have involved ""planned and deliberate actions by Russia"".
In his video address late on Wednesday, President Zelensky said it was ""obvious that the Russians are playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners, with the feelings of their relatives and with the emotions of our society"".
The Ukrainian leader, who has cancelled a planned regional trip linked to his birthday on Thursday, stressed that ""all clear facts must be established"".
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov condemned the downing of the plane as a ""monstrous act"", according to Russian news agencies. He told reporters that if Mr Zelensky meant an international inquiry into ""the criminal actions of the Kyiv regime"", it was definitely needed.
Video shared on social media showed a plane going down followed by an explosion and a fireball near the village of Yablonovo, 70km (44 miles) to the north-east of the city of Belgorod, at about 11:00 local time (08:00 GMT).
Belgorod regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said the plane crashed in a field near a residential area and that everyone on board had died.
Ukraine's general staff, quoted by the Ukrainska Pravda website, said initially that the plane was transporting missiles for Russia's S-300 air defence systems. It made no mention of PoWs.
None of the details surrounding those on board can be independently verified, but Ukraine's military intelligence said it was Russia's responsibility ""to ensure the safety of our defenders under the agreements that had been reached"".
On this occasion it said it had not been informed that the airspace had to be safeguarded ""at the defined time, which is something that had happened on numerous occasions before"".
""This can point to Russia's deliberate actions aimed at putting the lives and safety of the PoWs under threat,"" it added.
Ukraine and Russia have taken part in a number of prisoner swaps since the start of the war.
Ukrainian air force chief Mykola Oleschuk warned that throughout Wednesday Russian propaganda had tried to discredit Ukraine internationally. Ukraine had the right to destroy Russia's means of aerial attacks, he said.
Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine's second city Kharkiv with S-300 guided missiles from the Belgorod region in recent days.
Eight people were killed in a series of missiles strikes on Tuesday and another attack was launched overnight into Thursday.
Ahead of Wednesday's planned prisoner exchange, Ukrainian officials said the captured Russian military servicemen were ""delivered to the agreed location in time to be exchanged, and they were safe there"".
Russia's defence ministry said the swap had been due to take place on Wednesday afternoon at a border checkpoint 100km (60 miles) to the west of Belgorod.
The ministry said a military transport plane had taken off from Chkalovsky air base north-east of Moscow en route to Belgorod, alleging that Ukraine's air force had fired two anti-aircraft missiles from the Lyptsi area south of the Ukrainian border.
The Ukrainian government body in charge of PoWs warned that Russia was ""actively carrying out special information operations against Ukraine, which are aimed at destabilising Ukrainian society"".
Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine's parliamentary human rights commissioner, appealed to Ukrainians to trust only official sources: ""Do not be fooled by provocations. More detailed information will be provided later.""
Andrei Kartapolov, chairman of Russia's parliamentary defence committee, claimed there had been a second plane in the air transporting 80 Ukrainian prisoners, although that plane had then changed course.
""There can now be no talk of any other [prisoner] exchanges,"" Mr Kartapolov told Russian TV.
The biggest prisoner exchange since the start of the war took place earlier this month, when Ukraine freed 248 Russian prisoners of war and Russia released 230 people in a deal mediated by the United Arab Emirates.
More than 8,000 Ukrainians, both civilian and military, are still being held by Russia, according to Ukraine's Coordination HQ on the Treatment of PoWs, which says tens of thousands of others are still missing.
Belgorod, which is located approximately 25 miles (40km) north of the border with Ukraine, has suffered dozens of casualties from air strikes and drones since the war in Ukraine began.
In December, 25 people were killed and 100 were injured following an air strike - although Ukraine insisted that only military infrastructure had been targeted and blamed Russian air defences for fragments falling on the city.
Russia's war in Ukraine is grinding on as it approaches its third year.
Last week, Russia claimed to have captured a village close to the devastated city of Bakhmut, in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region. Kyiv has not confirmed the claim.
Meanwhile, Russian air attacks have intensified in recent weeks. On Tuesday, 18 people were killed and 130 were injured in missile attacks on Ukrainian cities.

48U6ANGNB8_Q68AKCSD4MNYNRU,King Charles 'doing well' after prostate treatment,By Sean Coughlan,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68055575,"King Charles has had his treatment for an enlarged prostate, after being admitted to hospital on Friday morning.
Queen Camilla said the King is ""doing well"". He is expected to spend at least one night at the hospital.
The procedure was carried out at the London Clinic private hospital, where Catherine, the Princess of Wales had surgery last week.
The King visited his daughter-in-law in the hospital on Friday morning, ahead of his own treatment.
Queen Camilla left the hospital in Marylebone in central London on Friday evening, having arrived with the King this morning.
Before leaving the hospital, she said of her husband: ""He's doing well, thank you.""
King Charles had made his health problem public as a way of sending a message to other men to get their prostates checked.
Following the disclosure, the NHS website saw a surge in searches about enlarged prostates, an interest welcomed by doctors and charities.
A statement from Buckingham Palace said the King was ""delighted to learn that his diagnosis is having a positive impact on public health awareness"".
He also thanked those who had ""sent their good wishes"".
The plan for King Charles, aged 75, to have ""corrective procedure"" for his enlarged prostate was revealed by the palace last week. He travelled on Thursday from Sandringham to London to have the operation.
A benign prostate problem, which is non-cancerous, is common in older men, according to the NHS.
About one in three men over the age of 50 will have some symptoms of an enlarged prostate, which is a gland that sits just below the bladder.
The medical treatment is not significant enough to require any constitutional changes for the King's role as head of state. There will not be a need for ""counsellors of state"" who can stand in when a monarch is seriously ill.
A spokeswoman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he had sent best wishes to the King for a ""speedy recovery"".
The King is being treated in the same hospital where his daughter-in-law Catherine had ""abdominal surgery"" last week.
When she leaves the hospital it is expected that she will spend several months recuperating at home in Windsor. It means the princess will not be taking part in any official duties until after Easter.
There was a third royal health story this week, when it was revealed that Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, had been diagnosed with malignant melanoma, a form of skin cancer.
It had been discovered during treatment for her breast cancer, which had been diagnosed last summer.
""Naturally another cancer diagnosis has been a shock, but I'm in good spirits and grateful for the many messages of love and support,"" said the duchess, who was formerly married to Prince Andrew.
A spokesman for the duchess said she will have further investigations to ensure the melanoma has been caught in the early stages.

Lily-Rae, from Nottingham, was diagnosed with a rare genetic condition called Stargardt disease in December.
Doctors told the schoolgirl that her sight is constantly deteriorating, but it is hoped she will keep some of her peripheral vision.
Her mum Emma has launched a fundraiser to make her ""dreams come true"".
Lily-Rae started losing her eyesight when she was about five years old, but was initially told she just needed glasses by opticians.
Emma said she noticed her daughter was having more sight problems when she picked her up from school, with Lily-Rae only realising her mum was there when she was directly in front of her.
The youngster says she dreams of seeing Paris from the top of the Eiffel Tower, and would like to go on safari in Africa.
""I want to see the Northern Lights, even if it's just one time,"" Lily-Rae told BBC Radio Nottingham. ""They are the most beautiful things. I love space and I even know how [the lights] are formed, which is very interesting.
""I want to go up the Eiffel Tower; I am horrified of heights but I would not care if I can see the beautiful view at night.""
She added: ""I would like to go on a safari in Africa; I also want to learn a few languages on my way. I definitely want to try and learn German, Russian and Thai - I just want to learn languages all over the place.""
Stargardt disease, which affects one in 10,000 people, is caused by a tiny alteration in a single gene, according to the Macular Society.
Lily-Rae, who has started learning braille at school, says she wants to be a scientist when she is older, so she ""can help find a cure for [her] condition"".
A target of Â£2,500 has been set in an effort to fund Lily-Rae's bucket list adventure.
Emma added: ""I worked in the corporate industry and career was my thing, but I'm a mum and that's what I have to put first. Even if I was working, I wouldn't be able to pay for all of the things she'd like to do.
""I felt quite bad about reaching out to people, knowing how difficult everyone has it at the moment, but [the appeal] has given me that verification and validation from people that it's something that's out of the ordinary.
""As a mum you want to protect your child and being able to take her to these places and putting those memories in the bank would be really special to both of us.""

4GXWZRWVWC_SZ51OYU3UIG7W1V,"MrBeast reveals he made $250,000 from X video",By Imran Rahman-Jones & Natalie Sherman,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68061020,"The world's most popular YouTuber, MrBeast, has revealed he made more than $250,000 (Â£197,000) from posting a video on X, formerly known as Twitter.
He had previously said it was not worth posting on the social media site as creators only got a small amount of advertising revenue.
However, after a U-turn last week, he posted an old video - which has generated more than 155 million views.
The stunt has been closely watched as X's business struggles.
Elon Musk, the owner of X, has tried various strategies to boost engagement on the platform since buying it in October 2022.
These include sharing advertising revenue with high profile creators, something that other sites, including YouTube, already do.
But the plans have faced doubts, as traffic to the site has declined.
X's advertising revenue has also plunged as Mr Musk's feud with advertisers over issues such as hate speech and misinformation rumbles on.
MrBeast - real name Jimmy Donaldson - had previously said that even a ""billion views"" would not make it worth his while to post videos on X.
But he said he was ""super curious"" to see how much advertising revenue he could make from the video.
He said on Monday that the big sum seemed ""a bit of a faÃ§ade"".
""Advertisers saw the attention it was getting and bought ads on my video (I think) and thus my revenue per view is [probably] higher than what you'd experience,"" he wrote in the post, adding that he planned to choose 10 ""random people"" to give the money he made.
Analysts said an equivalent haul would be hard to repeat without MrBeast's massive profile.
""He said he made $250,000, so not bad for one video,"" said Karsten Weide, principal at W Media Research. ""It's good numbers but you have to have a massive amount of traffic.""
The amount so-called influencers can make varies from person to person. The terms of individual deals are kept confidential, although it is thought the biggest names online may be able to negotiate special rates.
In November 2022, Forbes estimated that MrBeast made $54m in a year from his YouTube channel.
Since then, he has gained millions of subscribers on his main channel, to make a total of 233 million.
The size of his audience has prompted courtship from companies looking to boost their platforms.
MrBeast, who has claimed his videos cost millions of dollars to make, is reportedly working on a deal for a show with a huge streaming platform.
He had previously posted the same video, where he tries out cars of differing valuations, on YouTube in September 2023.
It currently has over 215 million views on YouTube, where MrBeast makes most of his money.
A MrBeast video can earn more than $1m onYouTube over time, according to estimates from influencer analytics platform WeArisma.
But on X, where new content dominates, a similar post may not have the same staying power, said Jenny Tsai, founder and chief executive of the firm.
""It would be interesting to see how the monetisation potential stacks up over time,"" she told the BBC.
In the screenshot shared by MrBeast, he reported $263,655 in revenue from nearly 156.7 million ""impressions"" or about $1.68 per 1,000 impressions.
Dave Wiskus, chief executive of Nebula, the largest independent premium streaming platform, said it was not clear what counted as an impression on X.
But he said the performance of the video suggested that creators might not want to simply write off X as a platform for sharing their work, noting that even for MrBeast, making more than $250,000 was ""not nothing"".
""If you're a creator who can pull in any kind of numbers and if you're already making the video and you can post it over there too, then sure, why not?"" he said.
But he said he did not think less famous people would be able to bring in equivalent sums.
""This was a one-off from the biggest YouTuber on earth that got international media attention,"" Mr Wiskus added.
""I don't think another creator who pulls in 1% of those impressions is going to put in 1% of that money.""
MrBeast's experiment is fairly unique.
Most creators would not attract anywhere near those viewing numbers, or indeed the global media attention that went along with it. As he said himself, the final sum his video earned him is not reflective of the experience for most of X's users.
It will undoubtedly please X chief executive Linda Yaccarino, who joined the firm last year following a stellar career in advertising. She is said to have privately struggled with the reputation of X, so it will be encouraging for her to see that ads can still perform well on the platform.
The company's owner Elon Musk visited the site of the Auschwitz death camp on Monday, following intense scrutiny of the way in which the social network handles anti-Semitic content on its platform. This is one of the big issues which troubles many of X's users and potential advertisers. It is one which Mr Musk must continue to address both in terms of words and actions.
There are also rumours that MrBeast may be negotiating his own show with one of the large video streaming platforms. If this is indeed the case, his experiment on X is a loud signal as to just how much he is worth.

4I182XA9QP_KIA2JUCPQFVO97R,Photographer Rankin reflects on his career and charity work,By Leisha Chi-Santorelli,6 days ago,20230123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-68035756,"Over the last 20 years, British photographer Rankin has profiled the world's most famous people ranging from David Bowie to the late Queen Elizabeth II. Supermodels and fashion shoots helped make his fortune. But it is charity projects that continue to keep him grounded.
Rankin, who was once labelled a 'bad boy' celebrity photographer, has mellowed since the Britpop heydays of the noughties and becoming a father. In an interview with the BBC, the Glasgow-born creative reflected on his journey from a working class background to the dizzying heights of fame.
""When my kid was born, and they started to grow up, I was very concerned that I needed to correct that balance of having this incredible job where you do get paid extraordinary amounts of money to do what you love. You need to balance the art of giving something back.""
Rankin, full name John Rankin Waddell, has used his profile to support numerous charities ranging from women's health issues and combating plastic waste, to recognising the contributions of NHS workers.
His latest campaign is for the Acid Survivors Trust International (ASTi) where his images are used in the book 'Tear Couture' which aims to bring attention to the continued risk of acid attacks as a form of gender-based violence.
ASTi, which counts the Princess Royal as its patron, estimates that more than 10,000 attacks take place globally each year, mostly on women and children. The charity found a large proportion occur in South Asian countries where garment and jewellery industries operate.
Anecdotal evidence shows attacks using corrosive liquids of hydrochloric, sulphuric and nitric acid occur at higher rates in locations where these substances are easily accessible, and where factories use acids in their manufacturing processes.
Some 710 acid attacks were recorded in England and Wales last year, an increase from 421 in 2021, according to ASTi which compiled the data by submitting a Freedom of Information (FOI) request to 43 police forces.
Rankin said taking on the ASTi charity project adds to his body of work in rethinking beauty standards.
The Belgian activist 59-year-old Patricia Lefranc, his model, has undergone countless surgeries after an ex-lover threw sulphuric acid on her. Few acid attack victims are willing to be photographed.
""I look at these pictures of Patricia and I think they're beautiful,"" Rankin told the BBC. ""I want to empower her through those pictures. She was very brave in showing me how extensive her acid attack was.""
""You have to have an empathy for anybody that's in front of the camera. It can be rather daunting,"" he added. ""I'm not taking something from them, I'm making something with them together. That's how I approach every single picture I take.""
""My idea of beauty was very influenced by growing up photographing beautiful people all the time,"" Rankin admits.
""So to challenge that, which I've been doing since the early '90s, I felt like it was my duty to not just buy into the beauty of the beauty industry or the movie industry. It's to buy into my own version of that.""
The 57-year-old said he wants to be able to ""take pictures that are unexpected and turn people's heads"".
""I'm trying to change the whole idea of what is beauty. That is the kind of thing that you're aiming for with these types of pictures"".
Rankin does not take a personal fee for charity work, instead using an expenses-based approach. Reflecting on his success, Rankin said photography remains his favourite medium.
""I own an ad agency. I've directed movies, I've made commercials, but I come back to photography and it's the thing that I love the most.""
He warns that younger people need to realise the industry has become even tougher in a digital age where everyone has a camera in the form of a smartphone.
""It's a very difficult career to manage,"" he said. ""You've got to reinvent yourself again and again and again.""
""You've got to remain current and it is a struggle. You have to kind of sacrifice quite a lot in your working life. I don't think that's changed.""
Rankin also holds the honour of having photographed all the top royals including an iconic image of Queen Elizabeth II marking her Golden Jubilee. At the time, he said in an interview that he worked hard to get her to smile.
Last year, he photographed King Charles III for the Big Issue magazine which helps the homeless and shared that the monarch was ""delightful to photograph and it was very easy to make him laugh"".
Below is a selection of images from charity campaigns Rankin considers close to his heart.
""I really love that picture because I feel there's a resilience to the image that maybe people haven't seen before. And I think what I'm always looking for is the person behind the Crown, not the Crown.
""I was looking for the person who has been in the wings and has that resilience and has got an opinion,"" Rankin told the BBC.
""To be really honest, I think we need some leaders like that in our lives.""
Cambodian genocide survivor Sokphal Din BEM had a way of looking at the lens ""as though he was reassuring the audience it was OK to talk about such tragedies,"" Rankin said in an interview for the Holocaust Day Memorial Trust.
For the charity, Rankin made five images: four of men and women who survived the Holocaust or genocide, and one of the teddy bear who accompanied Holocaust survivor, John Hajdu MBE, through the Budapest ghetto.
""I wanted my portraits to do something different. The West has been anesthetised to traditional pictures of disaster zones,"" Rankin said in a 2010 interview with Oxfam.
""My style of portraiture is always about bringing people out of themselves, getting them to share something. I chose to photograph the people against a stark white background instead of in their physical environment. The expressions in their eyes and on their faces - their humanity - was what I wanted people to notice and relate to.""
""You don't realise the scale of support that's out there - they fund research and new technologies, accommodation and support for patients, and extra services so more of us can access better care,"" Rankin said about his exhibition celebrating 75 years of NHS charities.
""I used to work in the NHS but honestly had no idea, and it really has been eye opening.""

Thabi Leoka said that the London School of Economics (LSE) awarded it but Business Day and Daily Maverick journalists said they have not been able to find a record of the degree.
Last week, Ms Leoka denied misrepresenting her qualification.
On Monday, she resigned from the boards of two prominent companies.
Mining firm Anglo American Platinum Limited said Ms Leoka stepped down from her position as a non-executive director ""in order to attend to her health and the questions she has been facing in relation to her academic qualifications"".
Mobile phone company MTN SA released a similar statement.
On the same day, she was informed about ""the immediate termination of her membership in the Presidential Economic Advisory Council"", Mr Ramaphosa's spokesman Vincent Magwenya told the BBC.
Membership of the body ""does not require formal vetting"", he said.
The council advises on ""economic policies that spur inclusive growth"", according to the presidency's website.
In earlier comments to South Africa's Daily Maverick news site, which had asked for evidence of her qualification, Ms Leoka had said that she had been busy and not had the time to get hold of her degree certificate.
""I'm not based in [South Africa] full time... I have been at the Miami Bascom Palmer Eye Hospital as I have glaucoma and have since lost sight in my right eye,"" she said to the online publication.
""You also don't have my names as reflected on my degrees,"" she added.
Last week, she said she was about to undergo surgery.
When the BBC asked the LSE whether it had a record of Ms Leoka's doctorate it said: ""We have checked our files and can find no record of 'Thabi' or 'Bathabile' Leoka being awarded a PhD from LSE.""
She had changed her name from Bathabile in 2018, according to South Africa's News24 website.
Ms Leoka agreed to appear on local station Radio 702 after the story was published in the Business Day newspaper last week.
When asked ""have you misrepresented your qualifications?"", she responded: ""The answer is a straight no.""
Ms Leoka has become a well-known commentator and economist in South Africa, serving on several boards as well as advising the government."
4O3V8YXUZN_36UKLAAADAAMX50,Saint Dwynwen's Day: The story of Wales' Valentine's Day,By Zara Morgan,4 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-47000509,"There's a 5th Century girl from Wales to blame for why people are getting unseasonably loved up on 25 January.
Saint Dwynwen might be the Welsh patron saint of love, but she did not have much luck in that department.
Legend has it, she had an arranged marriage gone wrong, a frozen man to deal with and ended up as an agony aunt.
Here's everything you need to know about Saint Dwynwen and what people in Wales do to celebrate.
Well, scrap Saint Valentine and his miracle-working skills. This girl - whose face you might have seen on a stained glass window in a church - has had a rough old time of it.
Brecon girl Dwynwen, one of 36 daughters of an Irish king, fell in love with Maelon Dyfodrull from north Wales.
But her dad, Brychan, didn't like the look of this northern boy and wouldn't let the loved-up pair get married.
Maelon lost his temper with Dwynwen and threatened to rape her when she wouldn't marry him, according to SiÃ¢n Lewis, author of Dwynwen: Santes Cariadon Cymru.
So she prayed to God, and he was turned to ice - to freeze his passion. An angel also gave her three wishes.
First she wished to be free of Maelon, and he vanished. Second, to never marry and finally to help other lovers in pain.
Dwynwen settled down after all that drama (worse than Love Island) in a convent in Anglesey, Llanddwyn church.
Just to finish Dwynwen's weird fortune in love, according to folklore, a sacred fish swam by the church, predicting the future relationships of couples with its movements.
Quite a few people apparently, especially if you search #SaintDwynwensDay on Twitter and Instagram.
And many people still visit the scenic Llanddwyn church, as part of the Anglesey Coastal Path.
Also it's a good day to give someone a spoon. Love spoons have been exchanged by Welsh lovers since the 17th Century.
Photographer Mathew Browne, from Carmarthen, said that the church is a ""hotspot"" for photographers because it is so scenic.
""It is rare to have the island to yourself with the age of social media, everyone is trying to get that shot for Instagram,"" he said.
Mr Browne, 34, added that he hopes to celebrate St Dwynwen's day with his wife and visit the church again.
""I haven't got a card or anything today, but I will do a cwtchy dinner in with my wife tonight,"" he added.
St Dwynwen's Day 'not a big earner'

4RZAFDZV59_7RRZLXM1B85SXNZ,Post Office accused of cover-up over secret Horizon documents,By Andy Verity,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68079300,"Post Office bosses secretly decided in April 2014 to sack forensic accountants who had found bugs in their IT system, documents obtained by the BBC show.
They also reveal the government had knowledge of the decision, taken by a Post Office board sub-committee, codenamed ""Project Sparrow"".
Former sub-postmaster Alan Bates said it was further proof of a ""total cover-up"".
The Post Office said it would be inappropriate to comment.
Downing Street said it was taking the reports ""extremely seriously"".
The independent forensic accountants Second Sight played a key role in exposing the scandal, finding flaws in the Horizon computer system which generated false evidence of cash shortfalls at sub-post offices, leading to wrongful prosecutions of sub-postmasters.
Post Office bosses kept insisting their systems were robust.
But they made a concession following pressure from MPs, offering to set up a mediation scheme to deal with what they said was a small number of cases.
The documents reveal the Post Office planned to pay a total of only Â£1m in ""token payments"", or compensation, to sub-postmasters as it suppressed evidence of computer bugs in 2014.
But it was a vast underestimation of the eventual cost of the scandal, which is now expected to be more than Â£1bn.
Details of the Project Sparrow discussions were not disclosed in evidence to sub-postmasters as they challenged the Post Office through the courts in 2017-2019.
""It's been a cover-up from start to finish,"" said Alan Bates. ""That's coming out now. It's undeniable.
""And this is what we've been up against all the way. We've always known they were covering up - it's just been very difficult to find proof,"" he added.
The secret plan to sack Second Sight is revealed in the minutes of two Project Sparrow meetings in April 2014.
The minutes were released in heavily redacted form in 2021 after former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells disclosed the existence of Project Sparrow.
Now the BBC has obtained the unredacted minutes, showing what the Post Office didn't want the public to see.
The Project Sparrow sub-committee was led by Post Office chair Alice Perkins and included chief executive Paula Vennells, alongside the Post Office's most senior internal lawyer, general counsel Chris Aujard, and Richard Callard, a senior civil servant at UK Government Investments, then a division of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.
The unredacted minutes for 9 April 2014 show the sub-committee asking for a paper to be prepared on the role of Second Sight and ""options to support them or reduce their role"".
Three weeks later, on 30 April 2014, they agree on a plan to bring the investigation of sub-postmasters' cases ""within the control of the Post Office"", removing Second Sight from its role of investigating sub-postmasters' cases independently.
However, that decision was kept secret from Parliament and the public as the Post Office claimed Second Sight's independent review supported its approach to sub-postmasters' complaints. The Post Office was then seeking to defuse the scandal through a mediation scheme, which excluded many victims from compensation.
Your device may not support this visualisation
Nine months before the committee met, Second Sight submitted a report on 8 July 2013 identifying computer bugs that raised doubts over the reliability of Horizon data used to prosecute sub-postmasters.
A week later, on 15 July 2013, the Post Office was warned in formal advice written by its own lawyer Simon Clarke that it was in breach of its legal duties because sub-postmasters who had been prosecuted should have been told about the bugs.
The next day, 16 July 2013, the Post Office board expressed concern that Second Sight's review exposed the business to claims of wrongful convictions.
Yet the Project Sparrow minutes from April 2014 show Paula Vennells, Alice Perkins and the other members discussed closing or speeding up the mediation scheme and planning to pay minimal compensation to sub-postmasters.
That followed advice from lawyers Linklaters that they had only ""very limited liability in relation to financial redress"".
The minutes show the committee asking for a paper to brief them on making ""token payments"" to sub-postmasters applying to the mediation scheme, trumpeted in public at the time by ministers as a solution to sub-postmasters' complaints.
""The cost of all cases in the scheme going to mediation would be in the region of Â£1m,"" the unredacted minutes state.
Members of the committee knew sub-postmasters wouldn't be happy and that there was a ""real risk"" that ""many applicants will remain dissatisfied at the end of the process"".
On 30 April 2014, following advice from Chris Aujard, the committee decided not to make any ""ex gratia"" payments - meaning payments to struggling sub-postmasters to help them while their cases were examined.
They also asked for a paper to be prepared on options for closing or speeding up the mediation scheme.
Second Sight's interim report in 2013 did say that it had found no systemic flaws in the Horizon system. But the word ""systemic"" had a specific meaning - that no flaws could be found in every single post office branch.
What the Post Office didn't say was that it also made an unwelcome finding, identifying incidents where defects or bugs in the Horizon software ""gave rise to 76 branches being affected by incorrect balances or transactions which took some time to identify and correct"".
On 17 December 2014, Jo Swinson, the former Liberal Democrat MP who served as Postal Affairs minister in the coalition government at the time, answered a parliamentary debate on the scandal. She pointed to the independent role of Second Sight.
The following year, in March 2015, as it prepared to submit its full report, 11 months after the decision had been taken, Second Sight's contract was terminated and the Post Office brought investigation of the sub-postmasters' cases in-house.
Lord Arbuthnot, a former MP and vocal critic of the handling of victims in this scandal told the BBC that the government has to take responsibility ""for everything that went wrong"" in relation to the sub-postmasters.
""It's a distinctly corrupt, murky story that goes right the way into government and it's deeply worrying,"" he said.
The prime minister's spokesperson said on Friday it was ""right"" that there was an inquiry ongoing and pointed out that the reports related to a previous administration.
""It is for the inquiry to establish culpability and to look at what lessons have to be learned. For the government's part we are co-operating and supporting the inquiry fully,"" the spokesperson added.
Alice Perkins and Paula Vennells didn't respond to requests for comment.
Linklaters also did not comment.
Chris Aujard and Richard Callard said through public relations advisers that they would not comment while the inquiry was ongoing.
UK Government Investments declined to comment.
Jo Swinson said: ""The latest revelations about the Project Sparrow meetings and decisions show the extent of the cover-up by Post Office Ltd - they were kept secret from Parliament and the public, and from ministers too.
""Not only did the Post Office directors, including the government official, choose not to tell ministers, they instead briefed the opposite. Repeatedly they told me that Post Office Ltd had never seen anything that would undermine any of their prosecutions, something that we now know is simply not true.""
A Post Office spokesperson said: ""We never discuss individuals and it would be inappropriate to comment on allegations being made outside of the Inquiry, whose role it is to consider all of the evidence on the issues it is examining and independently reach conclusions.
""We fully share the Public Inquiry's aims to get to the truth of what happened in the past and accountability.""

4TKWN20NYH_SMJKFNA50Q1H9NS,Market Weighton horse breeder given indefinite ban,By Kevin Shoesmith,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-68102165,"A breeder who kept horses in such squalid conditions that 10 had to be put down has been banned from owning more indefinitely.
Jane Moore, 66, of Jemoon Stud Farm in Long Lane, Market Weighton, pleaded guilty to 10 offences of causing unnecessary suffering to 17 horses.
She also admitted a charge of failing to meet the needs of 36 horses.
On 17 January, Moore was sentenced at Hull Magistrates' Court to 26 weeks' imprisonment, suspended for two years.
Of the 36 horses kept on the farm, 22 were underweight and most were suffering from dental issues and overgrown hooves, the RSPCA said.
RSPCA inspector Natalie Hill told how she visited the farm on 14 February 2023 after welfare concerns were raised.
An equine vet found one horse to be in such a poor state of health that it was decided to put it down immediately, the RSPCA said. Six other horses were seized.
In a statement given to the court, Ms Hill said: ""All the horses were living in extremely dirty stables with little food or water.
""Within one stable block there was a very strong smell of urine and the horses' rugs were found to be very dirty and extremely heavy. It appeared to me that all the horse stables had not been cleaned in some time.""
The court heard, at the time of the RSPCA's visit, Moore was in hospital and had left the horses to be cared for by friends.
When it became clear those friends were unable to meet the needs of the remaining horses, all of the animals were removed, the RSPCA said.
After the hearing, Ms Hill said: ""In all 10 of the 36 horses have had to be put to sleep and the others have got long-term health issues from being neglected for such a long time, such as ligament and joint problems.""
She added only a ""small number"" would be able to be rehomed.
In addition to the suspended sentence, Moore was ordered to pay Â£13,099.27 costs and a victim surcharge of Â£154.

51QY7QUU30_HAI5F3XUH14S1GL,Saudi Arabia to get first alcohol shop in more than 70 years,By Graeme Baker,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68085190,"Saudi Arabia has said it will open a shop in Riyadh selling alcohol to a select band of non-Muslim expats, the first to open in more than 70 years.
The clientele will be limited to diplomatic staff, who have for years imported booze in sealed official packages known as diplomatic pouches.
Saudi officials said the shop would counter ""the illicit trade of alcohol"".
Prohibition has been law since 1952, after one of King Abdulaziz's sons drunkenly shot dead a British diplomat.
The new store will be located in Riyadh's Diplomatic Quarter west of the city centre, according to a document seen by the AFP and Reuters news agencies.
A source familiar with the plans told Reuters the shop was expected to open within weeks. There will be limitations, however:
However - according to the document seen by AFP - these will not be particularly stringent.
Patrons will be limited to 240 ""points"" of alcohol per month. One litre of spirits will be worth six points, one litre of wine three points and one litre of beer one point.
There are also no suggestions that the clientele will be widened to ""ordinary"" foreigners in the kingdom without diplomatic privileges, who officially have no access to alcohol.
While alcohol will become part of Riyadh life, drinkers would be wise to be mindful of where they drink and how they behave afterwards.
Under current Saudi law, penalties for consumption or possession of alcohol can include fines, jail time, public flogging and deportation for unauthorised foreigners.
The document also said authorities are planning a ""new regulatory framework"" that would also allow ""specific quantities"" of alcohol to be brought in by diplomats to ""put an end to... an uncontrolled exchange of such goods"", it added.
For years diplomatic staff have had to use their ""pouches"", which cannot be tampered with by authorities in their host country, to bring in limited amounts of alcohol.
The moves are the latest in a series of initiatives known as ""Vision 2030"" to liberalise Saudi society under the crown prince and de facto ruler of the country, Mohammed bin Salman.
Other Gulf states operate similar alcohol regimes.
However, the UAE and Qatar also allow the sale of alcohol to non-Muslims over 21 in hotels, clubs and bars.
There is no suggestion from the Saudi document that the government there is considering doing the same.
While alcohol is forbidden under Islam, Saudi Arabia had until 1952 held a conciliatory attitude to its presence inside the kingdom.
That changed after Mishari bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, a prince, shot dead Cyril Ousman, the British vice-consul in Jeddah, in 1951 for refusing to pour him another drink at a function.
A year later, King Abdulaziz imposed a total ban on alcohol. Mishari was convicted of murder.
Why is Saudi Arabia spending so much on sport?

5210U33LRH_16AFS3QATY7H3SU,Boeing boss faces Washington grilling after blow-out,By Natalie Sherman & Tom Espiner,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68082728,"The head of Boeing is facing questions from lawmakers in Washington as pressure mounts to explain the mistakes that led to a panel breaking off one of its planes this month.
Boss Dave Calhoun told reporters ahead of the meetings that he was prepared to share ""everything I can"".
But he declined to comment on a report that said the part had been improperly installed at one of the firm's plants.
The anonymous account was posted online and reported by the Seattle Times.
The post, from someone claiming to work at Boeing, described the production of Boeing's 737 planes as ""a rambling, shambling, disaster waiting to happen"".
It said the firm's records showed that the four bolts meant to hold the door plug in place were not installed when Boeing delivered the 737 Max 9 plane to customer Alaska Airlines.
On 5 Jan, just eight weeks later, the panel blew off shortly after take-off, terrifying passengers, and forcing an emergency return to the Portland, Oregon airport.
No serious injuries were reported but lawsuits have been filed by customers since the incident, accusing the company of negligence.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has grounded 171 other 737 Max 9 planes with similar designs for inspection, forcing the cancellation of thousands of flights.
It also recently recommended airlines inspect Boeing's older 737-900ER models, which use the same door design as Max 9s, though it did not order the planes out of service.
The whistleblower account said Boeing should have halted 737 manufacturing due to an ""alarming"" number of issues surfacing on the planes during inspections.
In the case of this particular plane, it said Boeing and Spirit staff at a Boeing factory in Washington worked to identify and repair issues ahead of the delivery. The whistleblower says that in the course of that work, the bolts were removed.
But according to the post, a final inspection of the door never occurred, which the account blames on a breakdown in communication, in part due to Boeing's use of two different computer systems to report and sign-off on issues.
Boeing staff were the ones who removed the bolts, according to The Seattle Times, which said the information was from a different anonymous source.
Mr Calhoun referred questions to the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the incident.
Leaders at Alaska Airlines and United Airlines, which have two of the biggest 737 Max 9 fleets, have expressed major frustration with Boeing as the groundings create chaos and added costs.
In an interview with NBC News, Alaska Airlines boss Ben Minicucci said there was ""no doubt"" that the aeroplane came ""off the production line with a faulty door"". He said airline inspections since the incident found ""many"" loose bolts.
""I'm more than frustrated and disappointed,"" he said. ""I am angry.""
The comments underscore the difficult task ahead of Boeing to restore confidence among its airline customers and the flying public, which had already been shaken after fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving its planes killed 346 people.
The FAA is currently investigating Boeing's manufacturing process and reviewing its current system for approving planes, which delegates some of those powers to Boeing.
Online travel agent Kayak recently reported that searches from users trying to avoid Boeing 737 Max planes had jumped 15-fold since the accident.
Mr Calhoun told reporters that he recognised the seriousness of the concerns.
""We fly safe planes - we don't put [aeroplanes] in the air we don't have 100% confidence in,"" he said. ""I'm here today in the spirit of transparency.""
The incident has drawn attention to other issues cropping up on Boeing planes, including the nose wheel of a different Boeing plane model, a 757, which popped off as it was lining up for takeoff in the US on Saturday.
None of the 184 passengers or six crew members were hurt when the wheel fell off the Delta Air Lines flight from Atlanta and rolled down a hill, the FAA said in a notice.
The plane had been scheduled to fly to Bogota in Colombia, and passengers were put on a replacement flight, Delta Air Lines said.
It apologised to customers, and said the ""event remains under investigation"".
Boeing, which ended 757 deliveries in 2004, declined to comment on the incident.
Responding to the ongoing situation with Max 9s, Boeing's Stan Deal, its chief executive of commercial aeroplanes, said the plane maker had ""let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers"".
A spokesman said the firm had ""announced a series of immediate actions to strengthen quality"" including more inspections.
Boeing has also named a retired US Navy admiral, Kirkland H. Donald, to lead a comprehensive quality review of its commercial aeroplane operation.

52FLJIA46K_VRZQQHT8B5K13B4,South Korea: First lady's Dior bag shakes country's leadership,By Kelly Ng,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-68090638,"The controversy over South Korean First Lady Kim Keon Hee allegedly accepting a luxury bag gift has thrown its ruling People Power Party (PPP) into disarray.
Spy camera footage released late last year appeared to show a pastor presenting a Dior bag to her.
Some analysts say the scandal threatens the prospects of President Yoon Suk Yeol's party in April's elections.
Voters want an explanation from Mr Yoon, polls show, while the opposition has used the issue to attack him.
The video, published by left-wing YouTube channel Voice of Seoul, is reported to have been secretly filmed by the pastor Choi Jae-young using a camera embedded in his watch.
It appeared to show Mr Choi walking to a store to purchase the greyish-blue calfskin bag, with a receipt putting its cost at 3m won ($2,200; Â£1,800). Mr Choi then visits Covana Contents, a company in Seoul owned by the first lady, where Ms Kim then asks the pastor, ""Why do you keep bringing me these things?""
The bag was allegedly given to the first lady in September 2022, according to local media.
While the video does not explicitly show Ms Kim accepting the gift, the Korea Herald reported that the presidential office confirmed receipt of the bag and said that it was ""being managed and stored as a property of the government.""
Mr Yoon's office is reportedly planning to address the issue ""as early as this month"", Yonhap news agency reported, citing unnamed sources.
A recent poll showed that 69% of the country's eligible voters want an explanation from the president about his wife's actions. An earlier poll in December showed 53% of respondents believed her behaviour was inappropriate.
The scandal is blowing up just three months before South Korea's legislative elections. It also comes as Mr Yoon's approval ratings have been inching up after dropping steadily over the past year.
Seoul-based political analyst Rhee Jong-hoon has described it as a ""political bombshell"".
""The Kim Keon Hee risks are only going to get bigger,"" he told Reuters news agency.
South Korean law makes it illegal for public officials and their spouses to receive gifts worth more than 1m won in one go, or a total of 3m won within a fiscal year.
The opposition Democratic Party has also seized on the issue to attack Mr Yoon and his party.
""It makes no sense for the presidential office and the ruling party to continue to ignore this and talk as if an apology will end the matter,"" said opposition leader Hong Ik-pyo.
And last week, Kim Kyung-yul, another PPP leader, compared the first lady with Marie Antoinette, the notorious French queen known for her extravagant ways.
It is the latest in a string of controversies surrounding South Korea's 51-year-old first lady.
The opposition has long accused Ms Kim of being involved in stock price manipulation. Earlier this month, Mr Yoon vetoed a bill calling for his wife to be investigated over these allegations.
Last year, Seoul's government scrapped an expressway project amid allegations that its construction would financially benefit Ms Kim's family by raising the prices of land that they own.
The scandal has also caused rifts within Mr Yoon's party.
The president is said to have pushed for his party's leader Han Dong-hoon to resign after Mr Han commented that the controversy ""can be a matter of public concern"".
""Basically, the matter was a planned set-up using a spy cam. However, there were several misdeeds in handling the issues,"" the Korea Times quoted Mr Han as saying.
Both men appear to have mended their relationship and Mr Han remains in the party.
Mr Yoon's initial reaction could have been politically costly, Sogang University political science professor Kim Jae-chun told The Straits Times.
""Did he, in a fit of pique, call his chief of staff, and say, 'Just go' to that guy... I mean, you only have 77 days left to the election [as at Jan 24],"" he said.
Mr Han is widely considered a protÃ©gÃ© and close associate of Mr Yoon and is tipped to be a presidential candidate in 2027.

52GJQCFQ5M_QTWCJYFWJOIK7DQ,Amazon's record drought driven by climate change,By Mark Poynting,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-68032361,"One of our planet's most vital defences against global warming is itself being ravaged by climate change.
It was the main driver of the Amazon rainforest's worst drought in at least half a century, according to a new study.
Often described as the ""lungs of the planet"", the Amazon plays a key role in removing warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
But rapid deforestation has left it more vulnerable to weather extremes.
While droughts in the Amazon are not uncommon, last year's event was ""exceptional"", the researchers say.
In October, the Rio Negro - one of the world's largest rivers - reached its lowest recorded level near Manaus in Brazil, surpassing marks going back over 100 years.
As well as being a buffer against climate change, the Amazon is a rich source of biodiversity, containing around 10% of the world's species - with many more yet to be discovered.
The drought has disrupted ecosystems and has directly impacted millions of people who rely on rivers for transport, food and income, with the most vulnerable hit hardest.
One trigger for these dry conditions is El NiÃ±o - a natural weather system where sea surface temperatures increase in the East Pacific Ocean. This affects global rainfall patterns, particularly in South America.
But human-caused climate change was the main driver of the extreme drought, according to the World Weather Attribution group, reducing the amount of water in the soil in two main ways.
Firstly, the Amazon is typically receiving less rainfall than it used to between June and November - the drier part of the year - as the climate warms.
Secondly, hotter temperatures mean there's more evaporation from the plants and soils, so they lose more water.
The researchers used weather data and computer simulations to compare drought conditions in two scenarios: one with human-caused warming, and one without.
In a world where humans hadn't heated up the planet by around 1.2C, such an intense 'agricultural drought' - where a lack of rainfall and high evaporation dry out the soils - may only have happened around once every 1,500 years, the study suggests.
Climate change has made a drought of this severity around 30 times more likely, according to the researchers, and one is now expected to happen every 50 years under current conditions.
""This really is something quite exceptional,"" says Dr Ben Clarke, a researcher with the World Weather Attribution group.
As the map below shows, drought hit almost all of the Amazon basin. This scale - and intensity - makes it different to previous droughts, Dr Clarke told BBC News.
And if warming continues, such extreme droughts could become even more common.
""If we continue burning oil, gas and coal, very soon, we'll reach 2C of warming and we'll see similar Amazon droughts about once every 13 years,"" says Dr Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London.
More frequent and intense droughts test the Amazon's resilience. That has already been stretched by deforestation - around one-fifth of the rainforest has been lost over the last 50 years.
Trees help the area retain and release moisture, fuelling their own clouds, and they also help to cool temperatures.
While the effect of deforestation was not directly tested in this latest study, previous research has shown it increases the vulnerability of the rainforest to drought.
The world's largest rainforest is seen as crucial in the battle to limit global warming.
""The Amazon could make or break our fight against climate change,"" says Regina Rodrigues, a professor of physical oceanography and climate at the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Brazil.
In a healthy state, it takes up more carbon dioxide (CO2) than it releases.
This limits CO2 increases in the atmosphere from human activities, keeping a lid on temperatures.
But there is evidence that this may be changing, as trees die back due to drought, wildfires and deliberate clearance to make room for agriculture.
There is concern that if climate change and deforestation continue at their current pace, the Amazon could soon reach a ""tipping point"".
If crossed, this could lead to the rapid and irreversible dieback of the whole rainforest - potentially leading to the region becoming a significant source of CO2 emissions.
It's not known exactly where such a threshold might sit.
""I don't think that [tipping point] is what we are seeing [yet], at least in all but the driest part of the Amazon forest,"" says Yadvinder Malhi, a professor of ecosystem science at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the latest study.
Despite the latest record drought, there has been some encouraging progress.
The rate of deforestation fell in 2023 compared with the year before, according to the Brazilian space agency, with President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva pledging to halt it completely by 2030.
This - alongside urgent action to slash the greenhouse gas emissions that are fuelling global warming - can still help to protect what's left of the Amazon, researchers say.
""The loss of the Amazon forest is far from inevitable in the short-term,"" as long as fire and deforestation can be controlled, Prof Malhi told BBC News.
""But we do need to get to grips with stabilising global climate, as the risk increases with every fraction of a degree the planet warms.""

The concentration of certain chemical compounds in Irish drinking water exceeds European Union safety levels, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled
THMs are found in water treatment systems that use chlorine to remove bacteria and contaminants
They can be harmful to humans and the environment
The ECJ said Ireland failed to take measures ""as quickly as possible"" to restore the quality of drinking water
The highest European court has ruled that the level of specific compounds in Irish drinking water exceeds EU safety levels.
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that the Republic of Ireland failed to meet its obligations under the EU's main law on drinking water, Irish national broadcaster RTÃ reports.
It said the chemical compounds trihalomethanes, known as THMs, found in drinking water, are at an unsafe level.
THMs are found in water treatment systems that use chlorine to remove bacteria and contaminants and are harmful to humans and the environment, the court said.
The Republic was taken to court by the European Commission (EC).
It said that the Republic had failed to adopt the necessary measures to be in compliance with the directive, relating to the concentration of THMs.
It said the Republic had failed to restore the quality of drinking water ""as quickly as possible"".
The ECJ said that in January 2014 Irish Water was tasked with ensuring the quality of drinking water met EU standards established by Directive 98/83 on the quality of water intended for human consumption.
In 2015, the Irish authorities provided the EC with information on the levels of THM concentrations in drinking water but the EC said that it did not comply with the directive.
Subsequent orders were made in 2020 and, according to a court statement, the commission was not satisfied with those responses between September 2020 and June 2021 so it began an infringement proceeding.
Unsafe water failures 'put 900,000 people at risk'
On Thursday, the ECJ stated that although the Republic was free to define how it implemented the directive within its own legal system, it still had an obligation to respect all its provisions, including those related to THM concentrations.
The country could not ""fully justify"" the existence of a persistent failure to fulfil its obligations, the ECJ said.
High levels of THMs in drinking water had been observed over a considerable period of time, the court heard.
The Republic failed to contest facts alleged by the commission and the court held that the EC, based on the information provided, had provided ""sufficient evidence to support Irelandâs alleged breach"".
The ECJ therefore ruled that the Republic had failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 4 of the safe drinking water directive."

Birmingham's 500% rise in referrals between 2022 and 2023 topped the list of 280 councils that replied to a File on 4 Freedom of Information request.
Figures suggest there is Â£500m of uncollected public debt each year, adding to councils' strained finances.
One bailiff said he was incentivised to use underhand tactics.
This is despite industry claims that it has cleaned up its act.
The BBC's Freedom of Information (FOI) request asked councils for the number of referrals made between April and October 2023, compared with the same period the previous year.
Recently ""bankrupt"" Birmingham made 43,283 referrals over the seven-month period in 2023.
That was nearly six times the equivalent figure for the same period in 2022 of 7,875 (adjusted for comparison).
The responses from all the councils who came back to us suggest more people are struggling to pay essential living expenses, such as council tax, during the cost of living crisis.
The debts also include parking fines, non-payment of business rates and housing arrears.
The amounts are made worse because once a bailiff is involved fees mount up. But with many councils across England and Wales in financial dire straits every penny is needed to maintain essential services.
For Paul Crichton, the debt spiral was devastating. He could not pay his council tax and considered taking his own life, following the pressure he felt from debt collectors sent by Stockport Council.
The former Army medic told the BBC he fled his house to avoid bailiffs. ""They were so antagonistic that I would get up out of the house and basically stay out during normal working hours. My strategy was to stay out of their way,"" he told File on 4.
Stockport Council said it only takes enforcement action as a ""very last resort"".
However, Joe Cox, senior policy officer for charity Debt Justice, believes the way public sector debt collection is structured is problematic.
""The collection process pushes people further into debt, which means that it's harder for them to get back on their feet and it's harder for them to repay the original debt and reset their lives.""
Enforcement companies are not paid by councils and only make money if a debt is successfully recovered by the bailiff or ""enforcement agent"".
Bailiffs Behaving Badly
Councils are increasingly using bailiffs to recover debts on behalf of local authorities. Mark Lobel speaks to those working in the industry about their tactics.
Listen on BBC Sounds
But the industry's new regulator said she had reservations about this approach.
""I do have concerns that bailiffs are only paid if they collect,"" Catherine Brown, chair of the Enforcement Conduct Board, told the BBC. ""If I could wave a magic wand, I'd take those cases out where people don't act with humanity.""
But whistleblowers within the enforcement industry, including working bailiffs, revealed some colleagues do break the rules, to ensure they collect and get paid, even if debtors are vulnerable.
Kevin, not his real name, is one of 1,600 enforcement agents who has worked for one of the largest collectors of council debt.
Five years ago the Ministry of Justice planned to make the use of body cameras for bailiffs compulsory. There is still no legislation but the industry has adopted them as standard.
However, Kevin told the BBC: ""They were encouraging me to let the debtor ask me to turn the camera off, so that something untoward could possibly happen or an enforcement agent could possibly break the rules and say something they shouldn't say.""
He explained that certain goods are protected but without camera footage agents would ""say that they could take it"".
He added agents would also ""aggravate the debtor"" potentially leading to a physical assault and an arrest, ""so they could carry on removing goods"".
Kevin's former employer told the BBC it terminates the employment of any rule breakers.
However, one council in north-west England has chosen to follow a different route, with remarkable results.
The FOI data showed there were 73 bailiff referrals in Chorley from April to October 2023, down 80% compared with the same period in 2022.
""Rather than simply going to enforcement, we look at 'how do we support them?'"" said the council's deputy leader Peter Wilson.
""If we think they're vulnerable we refer them into our social prescribing team which actually works with GPs and other agencies to assist people.""
Mr Wilson explained the approach did not harm the council's finances, despite it initially costing more to run.
""If you get to the root cause early on, we can actually save the taxpayer money in the long term,"" he added.
However, most councils continue to outsource enforcement to the private sector, where it has been handled for around 400 years, although laws were updated in 2014.
But the civil enforcement trade association CIVEA, which represents the industry, said the reforms had been hampered by a series of missed government targets.
""The Ministry of Justice hasn't managed to keep up with the the one-year, two-year and five-year review that it was proposing,"" CIVEA's chief executive Russell Hamblin-Boone said.
However, the Ministry of Justice said it was ""committed to ensuring that all enforcement agents treat people in debt fairly and operate in a responsible and proportionate way"".
Meanwhile, Mr Crichton was able to overcome his situation - his bailiffs had signed the Armed Forces Covenant and his debts were passed back to the council once he was identified as vulnerable.
""I got breathing space while things were put on hold. Then an order was put in place to make sure that this didn't reoccur,"" he said. ""There's definitely better days ahead.""

5ESP9HDZAR_P61M2W3CCZL2W5F,Henry Okello Oryem: Uganda minister says people dying of hunger are 'idiots',By Swaibu Ibrahim & Gloria Aradi,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-68090485,"A Ugandan government minister is facing criticism after calling those who have died of hunger in his country ""idiots"".
Many have deemed Henry Okello Oryem's comments tone-deaf.
In 2022, more than 2,200 people died of starvation and related illnesses in north-east Uganda, a report by an official human rights body said.
But Mr Oryem argued that given Uganda's favourable climate and fertile land, people should be able to grow food for themselves.
""It's only an idiot, a real idiot, that can die of hunger in Uganda,"" the state minister for foreign affairs told the NTV Uganda television channel.
""If you work hard, there is land in Uganda. The climate is right in spite [of] climate change. If you make a double effort to make sure that you go out in the morning, you till your land, you plant the seeds, you maintain your plantation, surely, how do you fail then to get food?""
As well as killing many people, the food shortage in the north-east left nearly half-a-million people in ""acute hunger"", said the report by the Uganda Human Rights Commission, which was established by the constitution.
The minister's comments have sparked outrage.
Moses Aleper, a legislator for Chekwii county, which is part of the affected Karamoja region, told the BBC that Mr Oryem's views were ""not right"" and ""unfortunate coming from a minister who knows what goes on in this country"".
""I'm from one of the most productive parts of Karamoja where there is adequate rain and we produce food. But in situations where weather fails us, the weather vagaries set in, we definitely fail to get food. And normally people definitely get famine and eventually hunger strikes.""
Mr Aleper also said that hunger in the region is often caused by ""other issues beyond even human control"", such as the way that the climate is changing.
Prominent Ugandan author and journalist Charles Onyango-Obbo also hit out at Mr Oryem, saying that the minister failed to grasp ""that hunger in a country like Uganda is a distribution/market problem"".
Official data on the current food situation in Karamoja is unavailable, but it often experiences hunger during dry seasons due to the region's semi-arid climatic conditions.

5H9TX7DKGR_7585LM0JPVGR4AH,The mystery of the crumbling Edinburgh tenement,By Richard Forbes,1 day ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-68109162,"The first sign there was something wrong came in early December.
At a residents' meeting in the block of flats in Edinburgh's Newhaven, one of the neighbours told the others about a 3cm crack that had appeared on the external wall of their bay window.
An independent engineer was asked to come and take a look at the damage.
He told the city council he was concerned and the following week every one of the 12 flats received a letter saying the local authority would have to put up scaffolding at some point to make sure the building was safe.
Christmas came and went, the year turned, and that that was the last the residents heard about it.
Until Monday evening, when they were told the building was no longer safe and they had to leave immediately.
The sandstone block has stood at the corner of Lindsay Road and Archerfield since the 1890s. It faces a busy main road which links the port of Leith with the city's north-western suburbs.
This was once a heavily industrialised area dominated by train lines, engineering sheds and ship-building yards.
Over the decades, much of that has been stripped away and to some extent the area now mirrors the new Edinburgh.
What industry remains sits alongside expensive new flats, shopping centres, hotels, gyms and restaurants.
And right in front of the block is the latest part of the city's tram network. The Newhaven end of a 2.9 mile extension which opened in June 2023 after four years of construction.
A traditional sandstone tenement flat in the heart of such a neighbourhood is now prime property in a city whose council has declared a ""housing emergency"".
But the people who live there now find themselves in a crisis of their own.
A dozen households were made homeless in Monday's evacuation. They were given an hour to leave, with council officials going from door to door breaking the bad news.
The main road outside has been completely closed and none of them has been allowed to return.
Thimo Lam, 30, is a classroom assistant who lives in one of the flats with his wife and daughter. They bought their home two years ago.
""We got the keys on 1 April. It feels like a joke now,"" he says.
When they bought, a survey said there were no structural issues. After they moved in, hairline cracks started to appear on the internal walls and on the walls of neighbouring flats.
Then on Monday evening he received the message.
""Our neighbours contacted us to say the flats were being evacuated. We rushed home and managed to get some things out because we have an 18-month-old and we need clothes and nappies.
""We are very lucky that my wife's parents live locally so we can stay with them. Some of our neighbours were not as lucky,"" he says.
Christopher Milton was another of those who had to move out on Monday evening. The 34-year-old project manager has spent the last week sleeping on a friend's kitchen floor.
""It's been a complete nightmare. It's been stressful having to keep working through this. Even my car is stuck inside the cordon. I'm trying to get that out before the building potentially falls on top of it,"" he says.
Also affected are the three businesses that take up the ground floor of the corner block - a laundrette, a takeaway and a pub.
The Prom Bar used to be the kind of place referred to as an old man's pub. It was taken over and refurbished by its new owner just two years ago and now attracts a younger, more prosperous clientele, in keeping with the changing demographics of the area.
He had no idea there were any issues with the building until Monday, when staff were given 10 minutes to clear the bar.
It has been closed ever since and he has not been allowed back in. He has to wait while his tills stay shut and his stock goes off.
Some of the residents have looked across the road to the tram stop and wonder whether the construction works may have caused the ground under their property to be disturbed.
The City of Edinburgh Council says an investigation into the cause of the crack is ongoing. It says given the serious concerns about the structure of the building, the safest course of action was to evacuate all households without delay.
For those who cannot stay with friends and family, the council says it will make sure they have somewhere safe to stay.
Emergency scaffolding is due to go up this weekend then further inspections will be carried out to see whether it is safe for the families to return.
In the meantime, the road outside remains closed to traffic and pedestrians but the trams continue to run."
5IZC5C7RAU_AFY99FX7APTFA7R,Myanmar's army is losing - and facing fire from a militant monk,By Jonathan Head,5 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-68038513,"Last Tuesday, a noisy crowd of several hundred people stood in the small main square of Pyin Oo Lwin, a popular Myanmar hill town, to hear a bespectacled monk make a startling suggestion.
Min Aung Hlaing, the country's military ruler, should step aside, he said, and let his deputy General Soe Win take over.
The man who led the 2021 coup against the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, provoking a catastrophic civil war, has faced plenty of international censure, and is loathed by much of Myanmar's population.
This though was criticism from an unusual quarter. The monk, Pauk Ko Taw, is part of an ultra-nationalist fringe of the Buddhist clergy, which has until now been staunchly behind the military junta.
But a series of crushing defeats suffered by the army at the hands of ethnic insurgents in recent weeks has prompted Min Aung Hlaing's one-time cheerleaders to reconsider.
""Look at Soe Win's face,"" Pauk Ko Taw said to the crowd. ""That's the face of a real soldier. Min Aung Hlaing is not coping. He should move to a civilian role.""
It is not clear what kind of backing Pauk Ko Taw has in the armed forces. But his comments echo those made by other junta supporters, who are increasingly frustrated by the seeming inability of Myanmar's military leaders to turn the tide against their opponents. Pauk Ko Taw declined to be interviewed by BBC Burmese.
That he chose to give his speech in Pyin Oo Lwin will have added weight to it. The one-time British colonial hill-station is now home to the prestigious Defence Services Academy, where the army's top brass are trained. They could hardly miss the thinly-veiled warning: that they are running out of friends.
The nexus between the military and monkhood is nothing new.
Burmese monks have a long tradition of political, often anti-authority activism, from the anti-colonial movements of the 1930s to uprisings against military rule in 1988 and 2007. Many opposed the 2021 coup, some abandoning their robes to take up arms against the junta.
But some have worked with the generals, sharing with them a belief that both Buddhism and Burmese culture need defending from outside influences.
Following violent clashes between local Buddhists and Muslim Rohingyas in Rakhine State in 2012, one militant monk, Wirathu, helped set up a movement known as Ma Ba Tha, or the Association for Protection of Race and Religion.
It encouraged a boycott of Muslim-owned businesses, claiming that Burmese Buddhism was in danger of being wiped out by Muslims. But they make up just 8% of the Myanmar population. The movement was officially disbanded in 2017, but has continued to enjoy military support.
Wirathu, who had earlier been jailed for inciting racial conflict, was jailed once again in 2020. But less than a year later he was freed by the military - and Min Aung Hlaing showered him with honours and cash.
Min Aung Hlaing's coup in February 2021 provoked a huge public backlash, with massive rallies demanding a return to democratic rule, which were brutally put down. The 67-year-old general has since sought to bolster his legitimacy by presenting himself as a champion of Buddhism.
State media puts out a continuous stream of reports showing the diminutive dictator lavishing gifts on temples, and as a pallbearer at the funerals of senior abbots.
He has also been seen laying the foundation stone of the world's largest seated Buddha statue in the capital Nay Pyi Taw, funded by his military administration.
Myanmar's top religious body, the governing Buddhist council or State Sangha, has said little publicly about the coup. Some of its members are believed to have quietly urged restraint on the generals. But one senior monk in the Sangha, Sitagu Sayadaw, has openly supported the military, and even travelled with Min Aung Hlaing on an arms-buying trip to Russia.
Other monks have gone even further. One of Wirathu's followers, Wathawa, has been helping set up armed militia groups in his home state of Sagaing, to challenge the volunteer People's Defence Forces, which have sprung up all over the state to fight the junta.
Photos posted on social media carry the jarring image of saffron-robed monks being shown how to fire rifles.
The militias - named Pyusawhti after a mythological Burmese king - have been accused of forcibly recruiting local men, and of multiple atrocities against civilians. But they have taken root only in the small number of communities where the military's own party is traditionally strong. They also appear to have been ineffective in countering the now extensive and organised opposition to military rule.
One man contacted by the BBC in the area where Wathawa has been mobilising since early 2022 said he had only been able to recruit a maximum of 10-15 men in each village, and then only by threatening to burn down their homes.
He said many of the recruits had run away, and were being helped by other villagers to hide from Wathawa and his gun-toting monks.
Now the shambolic performance of the army in its recent battles with ethnic armed groups is sowing doubts in the minds of its supporters.
One prominent blogger recently called Min Aung Hlaing ""incompetent"", saying that under him the country had experienced loss and shame of historic proportions, for which he should pay the price and step down.
He was referring to the huge swathes of territory in northern Shan State taken by insurgents from the Brotherhood Alliance, three ethnic armies which now control much of the border with China.
They launched their operation in October last year, culminating in the surrender of thousands of soldiers, and all their equipment. The bloody two-year stalemate, between the well-equipped armed forces and the hundreds of volunteer groups which had risen up and joined the ethnic insurgents to fight the junta, appeared to have been broken.
The army has continued to retreat in the first weeks of this year. On the other side of the country near the Bangladesh border, the Arakan Army, one of the three groups in the alliance, has taken over several military bases, giving it control of large areas of Chin and Rakhine States.
It has posted videos showing bedraggled troops in tatty uniforms being led away handcuffed with cable ties, and huge caches of captured weapons and ammunition.
Unable to secure the roads from ambush, the military is relying on its limited number of helicopters to re-supply surrounded bases, and on air strikes to defend them, causing extensive civilian casualties. Insurgents in Kachin State say they have shot down one helicopter and one combat jet this month.
Some of the capitulating soldiers have turned out to be mixed units with little combat experience. The fact that many were also living in these bases with their families suggests they were unprepared to fight.
Hundreds chose to flee over the border to India; thousands have surrendered without a fight. Six generals defeated in Shan State were pictured afterwards drinking toasts with their captors, and looking more relieved than humiliated. After being handed back to the army three of them were sentenced to death, and the other three given life sentences, presumably in the hope of deterring others from giving up.
Such reverses are unprecedented in the 75-year-long history of the Myanmar military's campaigns against insurgents. Morale in the ranks has crashed. Recruitment in these circumstances is proving difficult.
So should Myanmar's coup leader be worried about these disaffected voices?
Pauk Ko Taw's bold criticism from the stage last week appears to have struck a nerve. Afterwards he was detained by soldiers and questioned, but quickly released, suggesting he does have some powerful backing. While his rally was reported in state media, his comments about Min Aung Hlaing were not.
Gen Soe Win, the man Pauk Ko Taw was urging to take over command of the army, is reported to be unhappy about the poor performance of his troops.
But he has shown no signs yet that he is prepared to usurp his boss's role. For the moment that seems unlikely to change.
Min Aung Hlaing has also proved adept at promoting and then sidelining potential rivals. Last September the general once thought to be his most likely successor, Moe Myint Tun, was suddenly arrested and later sentenced to life in prison for corruption.
For all of the dreams of the junta's most ardent fans - of a knight in shining armour coming to restore morale in the ranks - there is no successor in view.
Even in the wake of shocking battlefield defeats, Min Aung Hlaing has continued to preside over official functions, more in the fashion of a monarch than a military commander.
Whether this is down to his confidence, or his isolation from reality, is not clear. But the military cannot afford more losses on the scale of the past three months.
The collapse of the junta's forces in either Lashio, the main town in northern Shan State which is now surrounded; in Rakhine State in the west; or in Karenni State on the border with Thailand, where insurgents are close to taking the state capital Loikaw, might lead to a much wider breakdown in military morale - and the eventual implosion of the regime.

5L34EZYU7M_7GIS7702TOUTMFY,Newport Wafer Fab: Staff warn sale delays could risk jobs,By Shelley Phelps and Sanjana Idnani,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-68087178,"Staff at the UK's largest microchip plant have urged ministers to speed up approval for the facility's sale to a US company.
Its current owners were forced to sell over national security concerns.
Vishay agreed to acquire Newport Wafer Fab for $177m (Â£139m) after UK ministers ordered Chinese-owned Nexperia to sell its stake in the firm.
Staff at the site warned that ""procrastination"" over signing off the deal risked further job losses.
The UK government said it was ""committed"" to growing the semiconductor industry in the United Kingdom, including south Wales.
A dozen members of the Nexperia Newport Staff Association travelled to Westminster on Wednesday.
Principal engineer Denis Knight said they want the sale finalised swiftly to secure the future of the site.
""The only hold up now is the government,"" he said.
""We understand the complexities of it, and the due process, but we wouldn't want to see anymore job losses, or even the potential site closure, just because of any procrastination or delays that are avoidable.""
He said workers had experienced ""extraordinary uncertainty"" since March 2022.
""We've come up to Westminster today to urge the government to get this done as quickly as possible,"" explained Mary Curtis, who works as a programme manager.
""We want to be excited by the future of a new multi-billion company taking ownership of the site but at the moment there's some nervousness obviously relating to whether or not and when that sale is actually going to conclude.""
The delegation was hosted by Newport West Labour MP Ruth Jones, who claimed legal timescales for a decision on the matter had been missed.
""I've approached cabinet ministers, DSIT [Department for Science, Innovation and Technology] ministers and DCMS [Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport] ministers,"" she said.
""None of them can give me an answer about when the decision is going to be coming out.""
""We don't anticipate any issues but the longer it drags on the more the new company will get anxious and maybe itchy feet and move on. We will lose vital investment into Newport West.""
The delegation addressed the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on semiconductors, chaired by former Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns.
""We're almost there, I've been raising it with ministers to ensure that everything is being done to get it over the line, I'm really optimistic,"" said the Conservative Vale of Glamorgan MP.
""This is an exciting American company that wants to invest in the UK and give reassurance to the staff.""
Mr Cairns said Nexperia's acquisition was one of the first to be called in under new national security legislation.
""It's new legislation so the government are learning the process as they go through with it,"" he said.
""As you can imagine, as the staff recognise, national security has to come first.""
The UK government was concerned about national security over the Chinese-owned Company for two reasons.
The first related to Nexperia's development of the Newport site, which the government said could ""undermine UK capabilities"" in producing compound semiconductors.
Secondly, the plant's location as part of a semiconductor cluster on the Duffryn industrial estate, could ""facilitate access to technological expertise and know-how"".
Semiconductors, or chips, made at the site are used in millions of electronic products, from smartphones to household equipment and cars.
A UK government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to ensuring that the UK semiconductor industry continues to grow and thrive across the UK, including in south Wales.""
""Our ambitious Semiconductor Strategy, which was published earlier this year, is providing investment of up to Â£1bn in the sector over the next decade.""

Every week, the Must Watch podcasters review the biggest TV and streaming shows.
This week, Hayley Campbell and Scott Bryan join 5 Live presenter Nihal Arthanayake to review Murder Trial: The Killing of Dr Brenda Page.
It is a two-part documentary allowing viewers to see inside of one of Scotland’s most high-profile murder trials.
Nihal: “Scott, is this a Must Watch?
Scott: “It is, but not in the way that you might expect. This is a fly-on-the-wall documentary about a husband being accused of brutally murdering his ex-wife 45 years ago.
“But the series is more of an explanation into how courtrooms work, with cameras in there. The series is a deep dive into how the system works together. So, for example, you see the purpose of the defence, the prosecution, both parts saying exactly what they are there to do, but also - more importantly - what they are not there to do.”
“You learn that it is not about speculation: it's all about hard evidence. Even if you've seen countless true crime documentaries, you'll learn so much about this through this programme.”
“I think it is incredibly thorough. It's all about facts and the people in their process. I think this ended up being not so much a true crime series at all.”
Nihal: “Hayley, is this a must watch for you?”
Hayley: “Yes, it is. Like Scott said, it’s a fly-on-the-wall documentary, which I think may turn some people off because it's not filled with dramatic twists and turns and dramatic music to tell you how to feel. It's a real trial, and real trials don't work like that. For me, it's brilliant because of that.
“I've been a juror once in my life. It was an inquest, and I just found it completely fascinating being there. I was also really conscious of the fact that each juror was a completely different kind of person with different backgrounds, ages and cultures. They bring that up in this documentary: the fact that they don't know the personal sensitivities of each juror sitting there in that trial. Each of them is required to be there by law, so do they show them horrific images that will stay with them in their minds forever? If they choose not to, the pathologist will have to describe these wounds that killed the person anyway. I think it really shows how difficult a trial is for everyone, and how big a deal it is to serve as a juror.”
“I also really like how they show that because this murder went unsolved for 45 years, it really ate at the police who were working on it. Some of them are interviewed in this documentary now. They're old men, still thinking about it.”
“It also shows how attitudes have changed to domestic violence and abusive relationships. There are testimonies that may have been regarded differently back in the late 70s based on attitudes alone. Things that would be important now in any case may have been cast aside in the 70s.”
“I think it's a massive privilege to be able to see inside this trial for a whole bunch of reasons, and I'm sure none of this would have happened without the approval of the family. So we have them to thank.”
Nihal: “Wow. A resounding must watch.”
Both episodes of Murder Trial: The Killing of Dr Brenda Page are available to watch on BBC iPlayer now.

5XUMQ8DUFF_RY9NQ32S8SIY5K9,Kim Jong Un: Is North Korea's leader actually considering war?,By Frances Mao,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-68052515,"North Korea experts - by nature, a cautious group who seek to avoid sowing panic - have been left reeling by two of their own.
Last week, the two eminent analysts dropped a bomb - so to speak - in stating their belief that the pariah state's leader is preparing for war.
Kim Jong Un has scrapped the bedrock goal of reconciling and re-uniting with South Korea, they said. Instead, he's presenting the North and South as two independent states at war with each other.
""We believe, that like his grandfather in 1950, Kim Jong Un has made a strategic decision to go to war,"" wrote Robert L Carlin, a former CIA analyst and Siegfried S Hecker, a nuclear scientist who's visited the North several times, in an article on specialist site 38 North.
Such a pronouncement set off alarm bells in Washington and Seoul, and a massive debate in North Korea watching circles.
Most analysts, however, disagree with the war theory; the BBC spoke to seven experts across Asia, Europe and North America -  none of whom supported the idea.
""Risking his entire regime on a potentially cataclysmic conflict is not on-brand for the North Koreans. They have proven to be ruthlessly Machiavellian,"" says Christopher Green, a Korea watcher from Crisis Group based in the Netherlands.
He and others note the North often acts out to bring Western powers to the table for dialogue; and there are political pressures at home too.
But they do agree that Mr Kim's increased bluster can't be ignored and his regime has grown more dangerous.
While most argue war may still be unlikely, some fear a more limited attack could yet be on the cards.
Close watchers of North Korea's Kim Jong Un are used to his nuclear threats, but some say the latest messages from Pyongyang are of a different nature.
Six days on from his New Year's Eve declaration that ""it is fait accompli that a war can break out anytime on the Korean peninsula"", his military blasted artillery across the border.
North Korea has also claimed a test of a new solid-fuelled missile, and its underwater attack drones, which can supposedly carry a nuclear weapon, since the start of January.
They follow on from two years of near-monthly missile launches and weapons development in blatant contravention of UN sanctions.
However, it was his announcement of formally abandoning the goal of unification that last week furrowed brows.
Reuniting with the South had always been a key - if increasingly unrealistic - part of the North's ideology since the inception of the state.
""This is a big deal. It fundamentally alters one of the regime's core ideological precepts,"" says Peter Ward, a senior researcher at Kookmin University in Seoul.
Kim Jong Un would now be tearing down that legacy - literally. Along with shutting diplomacy channels and cross-border radio broadcasts, he has announced he will demolish the Reunification Arch, a nine-storey monument on the outskirts of Pyongyang.
The arch, showing two women in traditional Korean dress reaching towards each other, had been built in 2001 to mark his father's and grandfather's efforts towards the goal of reunification.
Satellite pictures released by Planet Labs on Tuesday appear to show the arch may already have been destroyed, although there's no official confirmation of this.
Kim Il Sung had been the one who went to war in 1950, but he was also the one who set the idea that at some point North Koreans would be united with their southern kin again.
But his grandson has now chosen to define South Koreans as different people altogether - perhaps to justify them as a military target.
Mr Carlin and Dr Hecker, the analysts who predicted war, have interpreted all of this as signs that Kim Jong Un has settled on actually pursuing a fight.
But most analysts disagree. Seong-Hyon Lee, from the George HW Bush Foundation for US-China relations, points out the country is due to reopen to foreign tourists next month, and it has also sold its own shells to Russia for war - something it could ill afford if it were preparing for the battlefields.
The ultimate deterrent, however, is that were the North to launch an attack, the US and South Korea armies are just so much more advanced.
""A general war could kill a lot of people in the South, but it would be the end of Kim Jong Un and his regime,"" says Kookmin University's Mr Ward.
Instead, he and others warn the conditions are building for a smaller action.
""I'm much more concerned, in general, about a limited attack on South Koreaâ¦ an attack of that sort would take aim at South Korean territory or military forces but be limited in scope,"" says analyst Ankit Panda, from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
This could even be in the form of shelling or attempted occupation of contested islands west of the Korean peninsula.
In 2010, the North struck the island of Yeonpyeong killing four South Korean soldiers, infuriating the South.
A similar provocation again could be done to test the South Korea's limits, analysts suggest, and to push the buttons of President Yoon Suk Yeol, a defiantly hawkish leader who has vowed to respond to a North Korean attack with punishment ""multiple times more severe"".
""North Korea may expect to draw out a disproportionate retaliatory attack from Seoul,"" says Mr Panda, something that might spark a broader escalation in fighting.
Others say war fears should also be put in the context of Kim's operating patterns.
""Looking at the history of North Korea, it has often used provocation to attract the attention of other countries when it wants to negotiate,"" says Seong-Hyon Lee.
The regime continues to suffer from economic sanctions and 2024 is an election year for its enemies - with the US presidential vote and South Korean legislature poll.
""This presents a good opportunity for Kim Jong Un to provoke,"" explains Dr Lee.
The current US administration under President Joe Biden - tied up with Ukraine and Gaza - hasn't paid North Korea much heed and Pyongyang has also typically had most engagement with Republican administrations.
Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump famously had a bromance in 2019 before the denuclearisation talks soured - and the North Korean leader may be waiting for the former US president to return to the White House, where he might weaken the alliance with South Korea and be open to dialogue again.
North Korea's closer friendship with Russia and continued economic support from China in the past year may have also boosted its audacity, analysts suggest. It's received technical help from Russia to achieve a long-term goal of launching its spy satellites and the two states had several high-profile meetings including a leaders summit last year.
""Much of what we're seeing is a result of broader North Korean confidence in its own capabilities and its geopolitical position given Russian, and to a lesser degree, Chinese support,"" says Mr Panda.
And others say Kim Jong Un's behaviour is all aimed at stabilising his own regime.
""This appears to be an ideological adjustment for regime survival,"" argues Professor Leif-Eric Easley from Ewha University in Seoul. ""North Koreans are increasingly aware of their Communist country's failings compared to the South.""
He suggests a policy focused on defining the enemy is intended to justify Mr Kim's missile spending during a difficult time. There are reports of starvation across the country.
Presenting the South as the enemy also makes it easier to resolve ""cognitive dissonance at the heart"" of the North's view on South Korea, points out Mr Ward.
""Previously it was an indelibly evil state that was supposed to be the object of unification with a hopelessly corrupting culture that should not be consumed under any circumstances but with people who need to be liberated from their evil government,"" says Mr Ward.
""Now the country and its culture can just be branded evil and that justifies the continued crackdown on South Korean culture.""
The BBC last week published rare footage showing two North Korean teenagers sentenced to 12 years hard labour for watching K-dramas.
""He doesn't actually want a war - a huge gamble where he would have nothing to gain and everything to lose"", says Sokeel Park, from Liberty in North Korea, an NGO helping North Korean refugees.
His threats are instead aimed at cementing his new North and South policy, designed ultimately to shore up his power at home, he says.
While it's important for South Korea, the US and allies to prepare for the worst-case scenario, it is also worth a thorough examination of the internal situation in North Korea and the wider geopolitics, analysts say.
At the end of the day, the best way to find out what the North's leader is thinking is to engage with him, argues Dr Lee.
""The international community does not see the US talking to Kim Jong Un as surrendering to Kim Jong Un's threats. It is seen as a necessary means to achieve a goal,"" he says.
""If necessary, one should consider meeting with the leader of an enemy nation to reduce misjudgements and prevent war.""

Brisbane Heat won the Big Bash for the first time in 11 years with a comfortable 54-run victory over Sydney Sixers.
Josh Brown's half century and Matthew Renshaw's 40 off 22 balls helped Brisbane set a competitive total.
Spencer Johnson took a career-best 4-26 as Sixers were all out for 112 in front of a record crowd at the SCG.
""Unbelievable - I feel like we were the best team all year so we deserve the medal,"" said the 28-year-old.
""I owe Heat everything, they brought me here last year and I didn't know where my career was going, so this is pretty cool.""
It is a second BBL title for Brisbane Heat, who had topped the standings during the regular season.
Johnson's figures are the best ever in a BBL final and included the key wicket of Josh Philippe for 22, as well as a brilliant caught and bowled to dismiss Hayden Kerr for seven.
""We're going to enjoy this one tonight. To get a couple of wickets and win, it's pretty special,"" added Johnson.
Brisbane reached the final last year but lost against five-time winners Perth Scorchers.
This year they lost the qualifier to Sixers and had to beat Adelaide Strikers to reach the final, before turning the tables to secure a first title since 2012-13.
Three-time winners Sydney Sixers won the toss and opted to field despite Heat having won all six of the matches in which they had batted first this season.
Heat opener Brown, who recorded the second fastest BBL hundred and the competition's third highest score of all-time in Monday's Challenger match against Adelaide, got his side off to a strong start with 53 off 38 deliveries, hitting three sixes off Kerr.
Captain Nathan McSweeney added 33 off 32 balls before Renshaw clubbed five boundaries, adding 40 off 22 before being run out from the final ball of Heat's innings.
Sydney Sixers were reduced to 57-4 inside 10 overs on their home ground, with captain Moises Henriques, who played despite testing positive for Covid-19, top-scoring with 25 off 27 balls, and were always up against it.

Locals described cowering in their homes while bullets flew through their homes during a seven-hour gun fight.
More than 700 residents had been displaced from their communities near the Guatemala border, an official said.
The Jalisco New Generation cartel (CJNG) is trying to wrest the area from the grip of the Sinaloa cartel.
Criminal organisations like the CJNG and the Sinaloa cartel have been infiltrating the region because of its proximity to the border with Guatemala and important transit routes for migrants, whom they extort.
The worst-hit communities are Chicomuselo and La Concordia in Chiapas state. Residents of Chicomuselo said 20 people - 18 gang members and two locals - were killed in a cartel battle on 4 January.
In a statement, the community described ""the pain at seeing children and youths trembling in fear and getting sick from having to live through these traumatic experiences"". They also accused the state of failing to protect them.
However, the Chiapas state prosecutor's office released a statement five days later saying that it had not received any reports of any killings in the area.
The military has been deployed to the region but locals say they are now getting caught in the crossfire when the security forces confront the cartels.
Entire families have left their homes and crossed the nearby Angostura lake by boat to escape the violence over the past days.
Local journalists said that their villages now resembled ghost towns.
Chiapas civil protection official Luis Manuel GarcÃ­a Moreno told Radio FÃ³rmula that 701 people had fled to the city of ComitÃ¡n, most of them women and children.

6MX6R15FPB_GAEESIWIL40E2ZN,Russian jet crashes carrying Ukrainian PoWs - Moscow,By Laura Gozzi & Paul Kirby,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68080529,"This video can not be played
The BBC has verified this video showing the moment a Russian aircraft crashed in the Belgorod region
A Russian Ilyushin-76 military transport plane has crashed in the southern Belgorod region near Ukraine.
Russia's ministry of defence said 65 captured Ukrainian military were on the plane heading to the area for a prisoner exchange.
Ukrainian military intelligence later released a statement accusing Russia of putting the lives of prisoners of war at risk.
It said it had not been told it had to ensure safe airspace over Belgorod.
The Ukrainian statement is being seen as a tacit acknowledgement that it shot the plane down.
Ria Novosti news agency said another nine people were on the plane, including six crew.
Video shared on social media showed a plane going down followed by an explosion and a fireball near the village of Yablonovo, 70km (44 miles) to the north-east of the city of Belgorod, at around 11:00 local time (08:00 GMT).
The regional governor in Russia's Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said the plane crashed in a field near a residential area and that everyone on board had died.
Ukraine's general staff, quoted by the Ukrainska Pravda website, said initially that the plane was transporting missiles for Russia's S-300 air defence systems. It made no mention of prisoners of war.
None of the details surrounding those on board can be independently verified, but Ukraine's military intelligence appeared to acknowledge that Ukrainian captive soldiers may have been on board.
It said in a statement it was Russia's responsibility ""to ensure the safety of our defenders under the agreements that had been reached"", but that on this occasion it had not been informed that the airspace had to be safeguarded ""at the defined time"", as on numerous previous occasions.
""This can point to Russia's deliberate actions aimed at putting the lives and safety of the PoWs under threat,"" it added.
Ahead of the planned prisoner exchange, Ukrainian officials said the captured Russian military servicemen were ""delivered to the agreed location in time to be exchanged, and they were safe there"".
Russia's defence ministry said the swap had been due to take place on Wednesday afternoon at a border checkpoint 100km to the west of Belgorod.
The defence ministry said a military transport plane had taken off from Chkalovsky air base north-east of Moscow en route to Belgorod, alleging that Ukraine's air force had fired two anti-aircraft missiles from the Lyptsi area south of the Ukrainian border.
The Ukrainian government body in charge of prisoners of war warned that Russia was ""actively carrying out special information operations against Ukraine, which are aimed at destabilising Ukrainian society"".
Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine's parliamentary human rights commissioner, appealed to Ukrainians to trust only official sources: ""Do not be fooled by provocations. More detailed information will be provided later.""
Andrei Kartapolov, chairman of Russia's parliamentary defence committee, claimed there had been a second plane in the air transporting 80 Ukrainian prisoners, although that plane had then changed course.
""There can now be no talk of any other [prisoner] exchanges,"" Mr Kartapolov told Russian TV.
Ukraine and Russia have taken part in a number of prisoner exchanges since the start of the war.
The biggest swap so far took place earlier this month, when Ukraine freed 248 Russian prisoners of war and Russia released 230 people in a deal mediated by the United Arab Emirates.
More than 8,000 Ukrainians, both civilian and military, are still being held by Russia, according to Ukraine's Coordination HQ on the Treatment of PoWs, which says tens of thousands of others are still missing.
A nationwide air raid alert was briefly in place across Ukraine shortly after news of the Il-76 crash emerged.
Belgorod, which is located approximately 25 miles (40km) north of the border with Ukraine, has suffered dozens of casualties from air strikes and drones since the war in Ukraine began.
In December, 25 people were killed and 100 were injured following an air strike - although Ukraine insisted that only military infrastructure had been targeted and blamed Russian air defences for fragments falling on the city.
Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the war is grinding on as it approaches its third year.
Last week, Russia claimed to have captured a village close to the devastated city of Bakhmut, in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region. Kyiv has not confirmed the claim.
Meanwhile, Russian air attacks have intensified in recent weeks. On Tuesday, 18 people were killed and 130 were injured in missile attacks on Ukrainian cities.
Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov has warned that while Ukrainian forces are suffering from a shortage of ammunition, Russia has used more than 600 missiles and more than 1,000 drones in the past two months.
For its part, Ukraine is fighting mostly by using drones. At the weekend, a drone attack caused an explosion at a major gas export terminal near the city of St Petersburg.

6VG679LUBO_01FZUZHH47UFIB1,McClure solicitors collapse: Families âthousands out of pocketâ,By Martin Lindsay,5 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-68070449,"Clients of a law firm have said they are in a ""legal nightmare"" almost three years after it went out of business.
McClure solicitors had tens of thousands of clients across Britain.
Its collapse in 2021 meant some people with homes in trusts struggled to sell them while others spent thousands of pounds in legal costs.
A former director at McClure said it was an ethical business and the Solicitors Regulation Authority said it was ""looking into complaints"".
Jan Brunton, 70, paid Â£3,000 to set up a trust with Scotland-based solicitors McClure in early 2020, putting Â£10,000 into it along with her Newcastle home, which she said was worth Â£180,000.
It was a desperate attempt to ""get her life in order"" because she was seriously ill with ovarian cancer.
Jan initially met a McClure advisor at Maggie's cancer charity in Newcastle, to help with will writing.
But during a later appointment at her home, she was approached about opening a trust.
She said: ""I didn't even know what a trust was. They [McClure] mentioned the trust, not me.
""I felt as though I'd been used, that they had pushed for this trust to be set up for me.""
Maggie's said it was ""deeply shocking"" and was ""not aware"" McClure was offering trusts ""as that did not form part of our agreement"".
Some people put property into trusts believing it would prevent their homes being sold to pay for care home fees.
""I was told it protected my house,"" said Ms Brunton, who lived alone after the death of her husband.
After McClure went into administration, law firm Jones Whyte took on its files and Ms Brunton said she paid the company Â£300 to review her trust because of what it called ""systematic issues"" affecting many of them.
McClure solicitors are still named as trustees on Ms Brunton's house, so she legally does not own it and cannot sell it.
Ms Brunton, who is still receiving cancer treatment, had been quoted Â£1,500 by Jones Whyte to resolve the issue.
She did not pay it and is seeking advice from another law firm.
Jones Whyte said: ""There is no situation in which a law firm could carry out this work free of charge.""
Paul Pygott, from Barnsley, said his mother, Ivy Pygott, was left with thousands of pounds worth of care home fees after a council accused her McClure trust of being a ""sham"".
Mr Pygott helped his mother open a trust with McClure and said his parents were told ""everything that went into the trust would be ring-fenced against care home fees"".
In 2019, his mother went into a nursing home for full-time care.
They told Leeds City Council about the trust, and they thought everything was being paid for by the council for the next ""12 to 15 months"", Mr Pygott said.
But, in October 2020, they got a call from the council saying they would not pay any of the care home fees.
""They [the council] believed that the trust was a 'sham' set up purely and simply to avoid paying council care home fees.""
""I was suddenly staring at a bill in excess of Â£26,000,"" he said.
Mr Pygott said he asked if the trust was legal and above board in his first meeting with McClure.
""They said 'yes it definitely is because it's run by solicitors, with years and years of experience',"" he said.
He added: ""I felt as if I was letting my parents down.
""She's never owed a penny in her life and as soon as it becomes my responsibility to settle her affairs, she's suddenly got a bill higher than she's ever had in her life.""
Ivy Pygott died aged 91, in 2020.
McClure said: ""This is most unfortunate. Avoiding care cost is never a reason for a trust but it can be a by-product.
""The trust is not a sham trust. The assets in the trust are nearly always protected against a claim by the local authority.
""It seems to me that either they did not get any advice or the advice they got was wrong. It seems to me that they paid when they did not need to.""
Former McClure director Andrew Robertson said the trust ""was and remains a good service"" and the fact McClure no longer exists ""does not affect the trust"".
He said the firm ""never targeted the elderly or vulnerable"" and ""never approached clients"".
Mr Robertson said it is ""not correct that many trusts had issues"" and that clients ""should not fear that money has been wasted"".
On the subject of people struggling to sell their parents' homes he said that, on occasion, the reason was that ""the agents dealing with the sale have failed to contact the trustees at the outset"".
Jones Whyte said: ""Our rates are comparable and often cheaper than other legal firms in the Private Client market.
""Should they not wish to instruct us they can instruct another firm of Solicitors.  If they do so we pass our file of papers to them, for free.
""We are regulated by the Law Society in Scotland and the Solicitors Regulation Authority in England.  Both of which are aware of the background to the collapse of McClure; the work we are doing to try and help following this and both Regulators support this.""
The Solicitors Regulation Authority, which regulates law firms in England and Wales, is investigating the McClure collapse.
It said: ""We can take action if we find evidence that solicitors or regulated law firms have fallen short of the high professional standards the public expect.""

76UXPH74HF_YAJPIOV0ENTAP7V,Boris Nadezhdin: Putin's would-be opponent vows to end Ukraine war,By Robert Greenall,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68095968,"This video can not be played
Watch: 'Putin has made mistakes', Kremlin challenger says in BBC exclusive
A would-be challenger to Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he would end the war in Ukraine on day one of his presidency.
Boris Nadezhdin told the BBC he was unlikely to win 17 March elections but Mr Putin would not last six more years.
But he offered a vision of a Russia without the incumbent, where conflicts would end and relations were restored.
""Putin has made a lot of mistakes, not just with the special military operation,"" Mr Nadezhdin says.
Mr Putin has headed Russia since the beginning of the millennium, his rule becoming increasingly authoritarian.
He has won several presidential elections comfortably, but in recent years no serious opposition has been allowed. The Kremlin maintains that elections are fair and he is genuinely popular.
Opposition leader Alexey Navalny, once seen as a major threat to the president's authority, has been in jail since 2021.
Other opponents have been assassinated, jailed, or forced into exile.
But Mr Nadezhdin, a local councillor for more than three decades, is seen as a former insider of the regime whose criticism of the Kremlin has so far been tolerated.
His team says he has gathered more than 100,000 signatures, enough to stand as a candidate.
He believes he will be allowed to stand in the elections, although unconfirmed sources say anti-war candidates will be barred.
This was the case with former TV journalist Yekaterina Duntsova, whose candidacy was blocked in December.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday that Mr Nadezhdin was not seen as a rival but would be allowed to stand if he met the necessary conditions.
The veteran politician says he has been criticising Mr Putin for the last 10 years.
""He practically destroyed the key institutions of the modern state of Russia. My job will be to restore these institutions,"" said Mr Nadezhdin.
""My first task will be to stop the conflict with Ukraine, and then to restore normal relations between Russia and the Western community.""
Mr Nadezhdin, who name is similar to ""nadezhda"", the Russian word for hope, said he had the support of ""dozens of millions of people"".
""There is a Russian saying - your appetite comes when you start eating,"" he says.
He said that as recently as two weeks ago, no-one would have believed he could collect enough signatures.
""My aim is to change Russia. I may not be president on 17 March but I should have the best result.""
He said that at the start of the war only 15-20% of people were against it but now the ""majority of Russians"" wanted peace.
He said he aimed to make Russia a ""great, peaceful and free country"".
""I am absolutely sure that Putin will not rule Russia six years more, because more and more people understand he is dragging Russia along the track of militarism, authoritarianism, isolation,"" Mr Nadezhdin says.

7DUMSZHIR4_GY92HUP0NNNUKHY,Safety plea over co-sleeping baby deaths figures,By Rebecca Curran,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-68101937,"Parents are being urged to heed advice on co-sleeping with babies after new infant death figures were released.
BBC News has learned that more than a quarter of infant deaths investigated in Scotland last year involved co-sleeping.
The NHS no longer tells parents never to bedshare with their babies but focuses advice on doing so more safely.
The solicitor general said the figures suggested some babies were dying in ""high-risk"" co-sleeping situations.
The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) has for the first time tracked the number of babies who died while co-sleeping with parents, following concerns identified as a result of its investigations.
During 2023 it received reports of 74 deaths of babies under the age of 18 months.
Of those, it identified 19 babies who died while co-sleeping. In a number of cases the parent or carer had consumed alcohol or drugs.
NHS Scotland no longer urges parents never to bedshare with babies, accepting that some parents will do so, but it offers advice on making it safer.
It says babies should be placed on their backs, in smoke free-spaces, on firm mattresses with pillows and bedding cleared out of the way to prevent suffocation or overheating.
Parents are still told they should not share a bed with their baby if they smoke, have taken alcohol, drugs or medicines that cause drowsiness or if the infant is underweight. They are also told never to co-sleep in armchairs or on sofas.
One mother whose baby died after they both fell asleep has shared her story with BBC News in the hope of raising awareness.

Dawn Fernand hopes to raise awareness of the dangers of co-sleeping after the death of her seven-week-old daughter.
Dawn Fernand, 33, from Forfar, lost her daughter Fern in November 2014 when she was seven weeks old.
Fern had slept in a moses basket during the night but they fell asleep together after an early morning feed.
""Then when I woke up, I realised that she wasn't breathing,"" she said.
""So at that point, absolute panic set in, an ambulance was called and her dad started CPR straight away but of course it was too late.""
Dawn described it as ""the biggest rollercoaster I have and will ever go through in my life"".
""You are in shock. You are numb. I remember my entire chest, it literally feels like you are getting torn apart.
""I lost part of me, and you physically feel the pain of losing that part of you. I will grieve forever. ""
There were no alcohol or drugs involved in Fern's death. Tests later revealed she had stopped breathing several times during her life, so co-sleeping may not have been to blame.
But Dawn said she still wanted to warn parents about the risks, to prevent another family going through what she had.
She said: ""With the guidelines recently changing, I don't think it is clear enough anymore that bedsharing is a risk. Whether you don't take alcohol or don't take drugs, it is still a risk to bedshare.
""I know how hard it is to raise babies. I know it's exhausting and I know sometimes all you can do is co-sleep.
""But please be aware that there is a risk while doing it. There are ways to make it as safe as possible, but there is still a risk. So I would always advise parents to put their baby asleep on their back, alone in their cot.""
Solicitor general, Ruth Charteris KC, said she offered her condolences to anyone who had suffered what was  ""without doubt one of the most devastating tragedies that a family could experience"".
She said that overall, safer sleep advice had worked to save the lives of thousands of babies but she was concerned by the findings which showed unsafe co-sleeping was still happening.
""I can understand the challenges of getting enough sleep as a family, but expert advice should be followed,"" she said.
""The evidence of the cases reported to the procurator fiscal shows that, tragically, babies can and do die in high-risk co-sleeping situations.""
She added: ""It is my sincere hope that by drawing attention to our concerns, prompted by the outcome of our investigations, that the number of baby deaths in which co-sleeping was a preventable factor, can be even further reduced through open conversations about safer sleeping.""
Lynsey Kidd, executive director at the Scottish Cot Death Trust, said she was concerned by the figures.
She said: ""The evidence tells us that for the first six months the safest place for baby to sleep is in a flat, clear, separate space such as a cot, a moses basket or a crib, in the parents' room.
""We are concerned as a charity because we support many of these families, and whilst we talk about figures, we see the absolute devastation for families across Scotland who are living with the loss of their baby.""
The Scottish government said it did not yet know the causes of deaths for the babies that COPFS had been notified of.
A spokesperson added: ""We are very grateful to the many charities that provide vital support and information to families at this very difficult time of their lives. We know that charities will be available to support families who require this as a result of the solicitor general's statement.""

7GWK64XGCQ_FAC8LOQP1PTPMSX,Ayodhya Ram Mandir: India PM Modi inaugurates Hindu temple on razed Babri mosque site,By Geeta Pandey and Yogita Limaye,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-68003095,"This video can not be played
Indian PM Modi inaugurates Ram temple in Ayodhya
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has inaugurated a grand temple to Hindu god Ram in the flashpoint city of Ayodhya.
He said it heralded ""a new era"" for India - the temple replaces a 16th-Century mosque torn down by Hindu mobs in 1992, sparking riots in which nearly 2,000 people died.
Top film stars and cricketers were among guests at the event in Ayodhya.
But some Hindu seers and most of the opposition boycotted it, saying Mr Modi was using it for political gain.
General elections are due in India in the next few months and Mr Modi's political rivals say the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be seeking votes in the temple's name in a country where 80% of the population is Hindu.
Critics have also accused the government of exploiting a religious celebration in a country which - according to its constitution - is secular. For Muslims, India's biggest minority, the event evoked fear and painful memories, members of the community in Ayodhya told the BBC in the run-up to Monday's ceremony.
Televised live, it showed Mr Modi performing religious rituals inside the temple's sanctum along with priests and Mohan Bhagwat, head of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) - the ideological fountainhead of Hindu nationalist parties.
""Today's date will go down in history,"" Mr Modi said after the event. ""After years of struggle and countless sacrifices, Lord Ram has arrived [home]. I want to congratulate every citizen of the country on this historic occasion.""
The temple has been constructed at a cost of $217m (Â£170m), funded from private donations. Only the ground floor was opened - the rest is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The construction work is part of a revamp for the city, estimated to cost more than $3bn.
The building of the Ram temple in Ayodhya fulfils a decades-long Hindu nationalist pledge. Many Hindus believe the Babri mosque was built by Muslim invaders on the ruins of a temple where the Hindu god was born.
The movement to build the temple helped propel the BJP into political prominence in the 1990s.
There was a festive atmosphere as tens of thousands of chanting Hindu devotees waved flags and beat drums - military helicopters showered flower petals on the temple. Saffron flags with pictures of Lord Ram line streets in the city festooned with marigolds, as do banners with the faces of Mr Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.
Some of India's biggest celebrities, including Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan and cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, attended.
In many other northern cities Hindus lit lamps, and saffron flags carrying images of Ram are fluttering on rooftops, including in several parts of Delhi. Cinemas screened the event, and big screens relayed pictures from Ayodhya to town squares and residential neighbourhoods.
The ceremony, called Pran Pratishtha, which loosely translates from Sanskrit into ""establishment of life force"", lasted about an hour. Hindus believe that chanting mantras and performing rituals around a fire will infuse sacred life in an idol or a photograph of a deity.
Several domestic TV stations built huge sets by the side of the river Saryu, a tributary of the Ganges, just behind the temple, and provided wall-to-wall coverage of the event, some proclaiming the moment of consecration as the start of ""Ram Rajya"" (Lord Ram's rule) in India.
Hindus celebrated the inauguration in other countries too. Massive billboards of Lord Ram graced Times Square in New York, where a group of devotees braved the freezing weather to gather in the middle of the night.
Temples all across the United Kingdom - where Indians are one of the largest diaspora groups - marked the event. Colourful posters had been shared inviting devotees to honour the occasion and celebrations involved flowers, sweets and music. There were also some celebrations in Muslim-majority Dubai - where Indians are a significant population - but from Indian news reports these appeared more muted than elsewhere.
In 2019, the Supreme Court gave the disputed land to Hindus after a protracted legal battle followed the mosque's demolition. Muslims were given a plot outside the city for a mosque but have yet to build one.
One member of the community the BBC spoke to in Ayodhya ahead of Monday's inauguration agreed that Hindus have the right to build the temple after the Supreme Court gave them the site.
""We did not accept that decision happily, but what can we do,"" he said. Another man said he was happy Hindus are building the temple - ""but we are also sad because it was built after destroying a mosque"".
The new three-storey temple - made with pink sandstone and anchored by black granite - stretches across 7.2 acres in a 70-acre complex. A 51-inch (4.25-ft) statue of the deity, specially commissioned for the temple, was unveiled last week. The idol has been placed on a marble pedestal in the sanctum sanctorum.
Thousands of police were deployed for Monday's event, despite Mr Modi having appealed to pilgrims not to turn up and to watch the ceremony on television. In many states a full or half day holiday was called, with schools and colleges closed and stock markets shut.
But a sour note was struck with some top religious seers saying that as the temple was not yet complete, it was against Hinduism to perform the rituals there, and many opposition leaders deciding to stay away.
Some opposition-ruled states also announced their own plans for the day - West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said she would pray at the iconic temple to goddess Kali in Kolkata and then lead an all-faith rally. The eastern state of Odisha (Orissa) unveiled huge plans to bring pilgrims to the Jagannath temple in Puri, one of the holiest sites for Hindus.
Authorities say they expect more than 150,000 visitors per day once the temple in Ayodhya is fully ready.
To accommodate this expected rush, new hotels are being built and existing ones spruced up as part of a major makeover and in recent weeks, a new airport and railway station have opened.
Officials say they are building a ""world-class city where people come as pilgrims and tourists"", but many local people have told the BBC that their homes, shops and ""structures of religious nature"" have been either completely or partially demolished to expand roads and set up other facilities.

7JAMVLLK3V_YR000GWJH79HO1L,"UAE has funded political assassinations in Yemen, BBC finds",By Nawal al-Maghafi,6 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67945137,"The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has funded politically motivated assassinations in Yemen, a BBC investigation has found.
Training provided by American mercenaries - hired by the UAE in 2015 - has then been used by Emiratis to instruct locals, sparking a surge in targeted killings, a whistleblower says.
The findings come as conflict in Yemen has returned to the international spotlight following attacks on ships in the Red Sea.
The UAE government has denied the allegations in our investigation - that it had assassinated those without links to terrorism - saying they were ""false and without merit"".
The killing spree in Yemen - more than 100 assassinations in a three-year period - is just one element of an ongoing bitter internecine conflict pitting several international powers against each other in the Middle East's poorest country.
The deadly atmosphere has discouraged the permanent return of Yemen's internationally recognised government. This, it could be argued, has indirectly helped to embolden the Iran-backed Houthis. Washington has announced that it will now re-designate the group as ""global terrorists"".
I have been reporting on the conflict in my native Yemen since it began in 2014. The fighting led to the government losing control of the country's north to the Houthis - who over the years have become savvier and better equipped.
In 2015, the US and the UK supported a coalition of mostly Arab states led by Saudi Arabia - with the UAE as a key partner - to fight back. The coalition invaded Yemen with the aim of reinstating the exiled Yemeni government and fighting terrorism. The UAE was given charge of security in the south, and became the US's key ally on counter-terrorism in the region - al-Qaeda had long been a presence in the south and was now gaining territory.
American mercenaries: Killing in Yemen
BBC Arabic's Nawal al-Maghafi reveals how the UAE hired mercenaries to conduct targeted assassinations of its political enemies in Yemen, with American mercenaries starting the killings in 2015.
Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) or on BBC Two at 23:15 on Tuesday 23 January (23:45 in Northern Ireland), or on YouTube (outside UK).
Listen to Nawal al-Maghafi's radio documentary on Assignment on the BBC World Service and on BBC Sounds from Thursday 25 January.
But instead of this establishing greater stability, during my frequent reporting trips at that time I witnessed a wave of mysterious targeted killings, in Yemeni government-controlled southern areas, of Yemeni citizens unconnected to terror groups.
Under international law, any killing of civilians without due process would be counted as extra-judicial.
The majority of those assassinated were members of Islah - the Yemeni branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. It is a popular international Sunni Islamist movement which has never been classified by the US as a terror organisation, but is banned in several Arab countries - including the UAE where its political activism and support for elections is seen by the country's royal family as a threat to their rule.
Leaked drone footage of the first assassination mission, first reported by BuzzFeed News in 2018, gave me a starting point from which to investigate these mysterious killings. It was dated December 2015 and was traced to members of a private US security company called Spear Operations Group.
I finally met one of the men behind the operation shown in the footage in a restaurant in London in 2020. Isaac Gilmore, a former US Navy Seal who later became chief operating officer of Spear, was one of several Americans who say they were hired to carry out assassinations in Yemen by the UAE.
He refused to talk about anyone who was on the ""kill list"" provided to Spear by the UAE - other than the target of their first mission: Ansaf Mayo, a Yemeni MP who is the leader of Islah in the southern port city of Aden, the government's temporary capital since 2015.
I confronted Mr Gilmore over the fact that Islah had never been classified as a terrorist organisation by the US authorities.
""Modern conflicts are unfortunately very opaque,"" he said. ""We see this in Yemen - one person's civil leader and cleric, is another person's terrorist leader.""
Mr Gilmore, and another Spear employee in Yemen at the time - Dale Comstock - told me that the mission they conducted ended in 2016. But the assassinations in southern Yemen continued. In fact they became more frequent, according to investigators from the human rights group Reprieve.
They investigated 160 killings carried out in Yemen between 2015 and 2018. They said the majority happened from 2016 and only 23 of the 160 people killed had links to terrorism. All the killings had been carried out using the same tactics that Spear had employed - the detonation of an improvised explosive device (IED) as a distraction, followed by a targeted shooting.
The most recent political assassination in Yemen, according to Yemeni human rights lawyer Huda al-Sarari, happened just last month - of an imam killed in Lahj by the same method.
Mr Gilmore, Mr Comstock, and two other mercenaries from Spear who asked not to be named, said that Spear had been involved in training Emirati officers in the UAE military base in Aden. A journalist who asked to remain anonymous also told us he had seen footage of such training.
The mercenaries would not go into detail about what it had entailed, but a senior Yemeni military officer from Aden, who worked directly with the UAE himself, gave me more details.
As the mercenaries' profile had made them conspicuous in Aden and vulnerable to exposure, their brief had been changed to training Emirati officers, ""who in turn trained local Yemenis to do the targeting"", the Yemeni military officer told me.
Through the course of the investigation, we also spoke to more than a dozen other Yemeni sources who said this had been the case. They included two men who said they had carried out assassinations which were not terror-related, after being trained to do so by Emirati soldiers - and one man who said he had been offered release from a UAE prison in exchange for the assassination of a senior Yemeni political figure, a mission he did not accept.
Getting Yemenis to conduct the assassinations meant it was harder for the killings to be traced back to the UAE.
By 2017, the UAE had helped build a paramilitary force, part of the Emirati-funded Southern Transitional Council (STC), a security organisation that runs a network of armed groups across southern Yemen.
The force operated in southern Yemen independently of the Yemeni government, and would only take orders from the UAE. The fighters were not just trained to fight on active front lines. One particular unit, the elite Counter Terrorism Unit, was trained to conduct assassinations, our whistleblower told us.
The BBC has found that despite the American mercenaries' stated aim to eliminate the jihadist groups al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS) in southern Yemen, in fact the UAE has gone on to recruit former al-Qaeda members for this security force.
The whistleblower sent a document with 11 names of former al-Qaeda members now working in the STC, some of whose identities we were able to verify ourselves.
During our investigation we also came across the name Nasser al-Shiba. Once a high-ranking al-Qaeda operative, he was jailed for terrorism but later released. A Yemeni government minister we spoke to told us al-Shiba was a known suspect in the attack on the US warship USS Cole, which killed 17 American sailors in October 2000. Multiple sources told us that he is now the commander of one of the STC military units.
Lawyer Huda al-Sarari has been investigating human rights abuses committed by these UAE-backed forces on the ground. As a result of her work, she would frequently receive death threats. But it was her 18-year-old son Mohsen who paid the ultimate price.
He was shot in the chest in March 2019 while on a trip to a local petrol station, and died a month later. When Huda returned to work after his death, she says she received messages warning her to stop. ""Was one son not enough? Do you want us to kill the other?"" they said.
A subsequent investigation by Aden's public prosecutor found that Mohsen was killed by a member of the UAE-backed Counter Terrorism Unit, but the authorities have never pursued a prosecution.
Members of the prosecutor's office - who we cannot name for safety reasons - told us that the widespread assassinations have created a climate of fear that means even they are too afraid to pursue justice in cases involving forces backed by the UAE.
Reprieve has received a leaked UAE document that shows Spear was still being paid in 2020, though it is not clear in what capacity.
We asked Spear's founder, Abraham Golan, whether his mercenaries had trained Emiratis in assassination techniques, but he didn't respond.
We put the allegations in our investigation to the UAE government.
It said it was untrue that it had targeted individuals with no links to terrorism, and that it supported counter-terrorism operations in Yemen at the invitation of the government of Yemen and its international allies.
""The UAE has acted in compliance with applicable international law during these operations,"" it said.
We asked the US Department of Defense and the State Department to talk to us about Spear Operations Group, but they declined. And the US government's intelligence agency said in a statement: ""The idea that the CIA signed off on such an operation is false.""

Metal detectorists reported 95 finds in the county compared with 83 in Hampshire and 81 in Kent.
The British Museum, which runs the Portable Antiquity Scheme (PAS), said 2022 was a ""record-breaking"" year for reported finds.
Museum interim director Mark Jones thanked ""the metal-detecting community"" who recorded finds voluntarily.
Lincolnshire had the greatest number of finds overall - other than just items classed as treasure - with more than 5,101. Norfolk had 4,265 and Suffolk yielded 2,727.
Although the report covers 2022, the findings were revealed on Tuesday.
There are a number of reasons for Norfolk remaining at the top of the treasure list, according to the county's finds liaison officer Helen Geake.
""Norfolk was always a very rich county, especially in days when riches depend on agriculture,"" she said.
""It's also very big, not very urban and very heavily ploughed, so things lost can be found and things buried can be eroded up to the top soil and found.
""And the third is we've worked with metal detectorists for a very long time and have a big team, so if something is found in Norfolk, people here know what to do.""
A gold Roman ring, with a red gemstone carved with a figure of the goddess Diana, was among Norfolk's 2022 treasure finds, discovered in Sedgeford near King's Lynn.
The image is similar to one found on a pendant from the Thetford treasure hoard, suggesting it might have come from the same workshop.
As the Romans did give and receive wedding rings, Dr Geake said it could have been given as a love token.
The British Museum also announced some ""significant"" new finds made since 2022, including a late Bronze Age dress fastener.
The 3,000-year-old object was found in Staffordshire by detectorist Jonathan Needham and would have been used to fasten clothing.
Museum scientist Laura Perucchetti and curator Neil Wilkin examined the find and it is likely to be acquired by a museum.
Another extraordinary find was an Iron Age hoard of 26 Iron age gold coins, hidden inside a flint container.
It was discovered at East Garton in west Berkshire.
Pippa Pearce, senior conservator, said: ""Every coin is a miniature document.
""To be understood, it has to be read and the role of conservation is to make this possible, revealing the hidden detail from beneath the concretions and corrosion built up during burial.""
A third find announced by the museum was a carved rosary bead, dating to between 1450 and 1550, and unearthed in the City of London.
It measures 27mm (1in) high by 21mm (0.8in) wide and shows the face of a young woman on one side and a skull on the other.
Mr Jones said the finds recorded by the PAS ""advance knowledge of past peoples, where and how they lived"".
""As such, it reflects every part of human history, from the Palaeolithic to more modern times, across the whole of England and Wales,"" he said.

7MVHSYXVQ2_4A218RFZVMODYHM,Bristol to host first regular drug checking service,By Nathan Heath & Rachel Stonehouse,3 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-68082844,"A regular drug-checking service, aimed at saving lives, is set to launch for the first time in the UK.
Harm-reduction charity, The Loop, will be offering a monthly drop-in drug testing service combined with health advice in Bristol from Saturday.
Licensed by the Home Office, it will focus on dependent, frequent and problematic use.
It is hoped the new scheme will reduce drug-related medical incidents, overdoses and hospital admissions.
""It could not come at a more important time, the adulteration risks of the illegal drug market have never been greater,"" said The Loop founder, Prof Fiona Measham.
""After 12 years of preparations, evaluations and negotiations, it is fantastic that we can start the UK's first regular drug checking service.
""With more cities due to follow soon, this is a landmark moment for harm reduction.""
The free-to-access service will run over the last weekend of every month, aiming to reduce the consumption of adulterants and contaminated drugs and the risk of poisoning and overdose, while signposting service users to support services.
Service users will hand over substances of concern, which are later destroyed, for laboratory analysis by chemists.
The Loop said it is clear ""all drug-use carries risk"" but it is important to reduce the harm caused to individuals and wider society.
Funded by Bristol City Council and operated by The Loop's team of professional chemists and health professionals, the new service is a multi-agency partnership together with Bristol Drugs Project (BDP), and the universities of Liverpool and Bath.
Wendy Teasdill welcomes the new drug-testing scheme, but it comes more than a decade too late for her daughter.
On 8 August 2013, 18-year-old Ellie Rowe died after taking ketamine at Boomtown Fair, a festival near Winchester.
""Ellie was curious, she loved playing jokes on people, was intelligent and she wanted to learn,"" said Ms Teasdill.
""Had I said don't take ketamine she'd wouldn't have listened.
""It is normal for young people to not do what their parents tell them to doâ¦I really wish we'd had some informed conversations - I did not know what ketamine was.""
Ms Teasdill, from Glastonbury, Somerset, continues to campaign for better drug awareness and education, to prevent other families from going through a similar tragedy.
""I think this new drug checking service is great, may this be a seed out of which greater flowers will bloom and grow,"" she added.
""Ellie would still be here if drug checking had been in place when she went to Boomtown. It'll help to save lives.""
The Loop has previously run pop-up drugs testing sites, including at music festivals.
The launch of the service comes after super-strength street drugs more powerful than heroin were linked to at least 54 deaths in the UK in the past six months.
The deaths are all linked to synthetic opioids called nitazenes, which experts fear are being manufactured in labs and then imported into the UK from China.
Bristol City councillor Ellie King, cabinet lead for health, said: ""This new initiative is ultimately going to save lives.
""This is about working in partnership to help reduce harm to our communities and empowering people to make safer, more informed choices, with access to drug treatment and further support.""
The Bristol Drugs Checking Service aims to reduce harm from dependent and high risk drug-taking and increase understanding of local drug markets.
It will also work with the police and health services, to pass on harm reduction messages to wider drug-using communities.
A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We are clear - there is no safe way to take illegal drugs.
""This licence, issued under strict conditions, will mean the most vulnerable people at risk of dying from their addiction can receive guidance and support to help them become drug free, whilst providing vital intelligence to local agencies and police to help respond to dangerous drugs in circulation.
""Our 10-year Drugs Strategy takes a two-pronged approach to tackling drug misuse by relentlessly pursuing the criminal networks supplying them, and building a world-class treatment system to turn people's lives around and prevent more tragic deaths.""
In September, The UK's first official consumption room for illegal drugs was approved by authorities in Glasgow.
The facility is backed by the Scottish government as a way to tackle the country's drugs deaths crisis.

7Y2IA87C9G_3ANIYHCAJL4YS3Z,We fear for our future if our day centre closes,Morven Mckinnon,23 January 2024,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cv2jrplle77o,"Ann Armour has attended the centre for the past three and a half years and now volunteers there
The threat of closure hanging over an Ayrshire community hub is leaving those who use it fearing for their future, according to service users.
They have told BBC Scotland News that The Morven Day Centre in Kilmarnock is a lifeline for about 120 adults with mental health problems or learning disabilities.
It enables them to take part in activities like swimming, singing groups and cookery classes, while offering them support to improve their day-to-day lives.
But now its future is under threat after East Ayrshire Health and Social Care Parternship (EAHSCP) announced plans to withdraw vital funding.
The centre received Â£233,593 from the council annually.
CrossReach, which runs the service, says it helps people control their mental health and prevent them reaching crisis point.
If it closes, people will go unsupported as no similar provision exists locally, it warned.
EAHSCP said it was contacting people who use the centre to help them find alternative support.

Ann Armour, 61, who has used the centre for three and a half years, said no services could match what the centre provided.
""This recovery centre for me has been my lifeline. I've been all over the country looking for help and I can hand on heart tell you, these people know what they're doing,"" she said.
""The fear of this happening and atmosphere from individuals in here is actually frightening.""
As well as taking part in a variety of groups, she also volunteers at the centre and last year won an award for her efforts.
She said the centre had allowed her to live a decent life, without the fear of her world ""caving in"" everyday.
""Nobody likes change, everybody is terrified. The thing is, there a lot of people who haven't even yet met The Morven for their recovery.
""To take that before somebody even reaches here is absolutely despicable.""
Cheryl Scott attends The Morven Day Centre three times a week
Cheryl Scott started going to The Morven Day Centre last May, after she suffered two strokes and a heart attack, causing her to lose her confidence.
She said she was a ""shell of person"" but the centre helped her make friends and develop in ways she could not have imagined.
""I was literally petrified to leave the house, I'd sat in the house for the last three years,"" she said.
""I'd lost all friends and it took me a big step to go to the Morven because I had never heard of it before. As soon as I walked in the door, people were so nice.""
She has joined a singing group and she received support to move to a new home after she struggled to cope with the stairs in her former house.
""I don't want to sound too dramatic but I was sitting at home for three years waiting to die. I didn't see a future, I now have a future,"" she added.
""It's not the future I maybe envisaged when I was younger but it's a future and without the Morven I wouldn't have that at all.""
She said the help they offer at the centre was not measurable and if it was to disappear, her and many others would not have anywhere to go.
""For some, there won't be a future and that's what Iâm scared of,"" she added.
About 120 adults who live with a learning disability or have mental health problems attend the centre
John MacDonald, the head of adult care services at CrossReach, said concern for service users was the number one priority.
""As such we are extremely worried that the implications of this decision will mean that people will have to go unsupported, as at this time no equivalent provision exists,"" he said.
""We firmly believe in the value of the model of care at Morven Day Services. We act early to help people regain control of their mental health, preventing them from reaching crisis point.
""We want to see greater investment in wellbeing and are looking at alternative options to keep the service going.""
Local Scottish Conservative MSP Brian Whittle said he was ""utterly opposed"" to the decision which would pile extra strain on the NHS.
""As someone who has been a regular visitor to the centre for years, I've seen the difference it makes to the lives of people in and around Kilmarnock, giving them a sense of community and offering them new opportunities,"" he added.
EAHSCP said it came to the decision to close The Morven Day Centre after a review of services to ensure people were being appropriately supported, and that money was being spent effectively.
Jo Gibson, the parternship's head of wellbeing and recovery, said: ""The wellbeing of East Ayrshire residents is our highest priority.
""All those currently attending the Morven Centre are in the process of being contacted, their needs discussed, and appropriate alternative supports identified. This has already begun.""

Mark Holden's car was broken into at Manchester Airport on Sunday, 20 January.
Thieves stole cushions that were made from t-shirts that belonged to his son Jay, who died in a road accident in 2022.
He is now asking that the culprits ""have a heart"" and return the treasured reminders of the 23-year-old.
Mr Holden said he kept the cushions in the front seat of his car when driving alone.
He added: ""They gave me so much comfort and made me feel close to Jay.
""I am currently feeling distraught and absolutely disgusted that some people can be so evil.""
In a Facebook post that has been shared thousands of times, Mr Holden, 50, said the cushions were ""worthless to anybody else but are priceless to me"".
He told BBC Radio Manchester he ""felt sick"" when he realised the cushions - which had been made by Jay's grandmother - had been taken.
A car key, spare glasses and bottles of aftershave were also stolen from the car, which was parked on International Approach.
Greater Manchester Police said it had investigated the theft from the vehicle, but added: ""Unfortunately, after conducting several lines of enquiries no suspect could be identified.
""If further evidence comes to light, officers will reopen the case to ensure a prompt and effective investigation can continue to take place.""
A Manchester Airport spokesman said: ""We are saddened to learn of this appalling theft.""
The spokesman added: ""We take the security of our car parks extremely seriously and have an extensive CCTV network as well as a dedicated team that patrols them.
""Millions of passengers use our parking facilities every year and, thanks to the measures we have in place, incidents like this are extremely rare.""

825KGPYOAU_JQ5IBO4170J8H78,"Stanley cups: Woman arrested for stealing $2,500 of quenchers",By Robert Greenall,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68067495,"A woman has been arrested for allegedly trying to steal Stanley cups worth $2,500 (Â£1,965) from a California shop.
The 23-year-old was challenged by staff but refused to pay for the items, stuffing them into a car, police say.
The Stanley cup, specifically the Adventure Quencher Travel Tumbler, has gone viral on TikTok.
The #Stanleycup hashtag has had more than seven billion views worldwide, and the craze has led to a number of attempts at law-breaking.
One popular recent video showed a man jumping across a Starbucks counter in an effort to steal a hot pink limited edition of the flask.
Police in the city of Roseville, a suburb of California state capital Sacramento, said officers responded to a theft after staff at a local store spotted a woman wheeling a shopping trolley full of the water bottles to the boot of a car.
""The suspect refused to stop for staff and stuffed her car with the stolen merchandise,"" the police statement said, adding that traffic police stopped the car as it tried to enter a nearby highway.
A search of the vehicle revealed 65 Stanley cups.
The police department had a message of warning for any would-be law-breakers.
""While Stanley Quenchers are all the rage, we strongly advise against turning to crime to fulfill your hydration habits,"" the statement said.
The reusable cups were first invented in 1913 by William Stanley Junior and marketed as ""unbreakable"". They became popular two years ago among eco-friendly, health conscious, often teenage Tiktokers.
Recent limited editions of the quenchers appear to have caused mayhem at some US stores.
TikTok videos showed overnight queuing and a mad dash to buy the cups - retailing at $54.50 (Â£42.99) - at one Target supermarket.

85CEOYORG5_ZYC0N4LOHVMLO7D,Wales gets extra Â£25m from English council funding boost,By David Deans,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-68086282,"Wales is to get an extra Â£25m for public services off the back of a boost for English councils aimed at tackling a cash crisis.
An additional Â£500m announced for social care has triggered more funding for the Welsh government.
Plaid Cymru wants the cash to be given to rural councils seeing the smallest increase in their budgets next year.
The Welsh government said it did not get notice of the funding announcement and was awaiting clarity on the detail.
If ministers choose to put the extra Â£25m into local government, the money would be a tiny addition to the overall Â£5.5bn budget.
Welsh public services get extra money when the UK government boosts funding to services in England, like health and councils, which are run from Cardiff in Wales.
Ministers are not required to spend the money in the same way as the UK government, and can put it into other services.
In the local government settlement, announced last year, Newport council saw the largest budget increase at 4.7%, while Conwy and Gwynedd got the worst at 2%.
The UK government said that it was likely that around Â£25m extra would be provided to the Welsh government, with final amounts to be confirmed later.
The Welsh government said it was not told about the funding announcement and was waiting for the details to become clearer.
""We have protected local government funding in our draft budget, despite the financial challenges we have faced,"" it added.
Plaid Cymru's finance spokesman Peredur Owen Griffiths said the party ""will be pressing for urgent clarity regarding the amount of consequentials for Wales from this new funding"".
""Additional funds could be used to raise the funding floor from 2% to at least 3%, which would significantly benefit many local authorities, particularly those in rural areas. This must be done swiftly before councils approve their budgets at the end of February.""
Anthony Hunt, finance spokesperson for the Welsh Local Government Association and a Labour council leader in Torfaen, said: ""It is vital now that the consequential funding allocation arising as a result of today's announcement is passported in full to Welsh councils to help our hard-hit social care services and to fund our schools.""
Welsh Conservative shadow minister for local government Sam Rowlands said: ""It's imperative that every penny of this funding makes its way to into council budgets and that none of it is pinched by Labour and Plaid Cymru to fund their vanity projects.""

85J1YN8P31_1B2YWA0RYDCS9FJ,US scientist recommends adding salt to make perfect cup of tea,By James Gregory,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68085304,"The British claim to know a thing or two when it comes to making a good cup of tea.
The beverage is a cultural institution in the UK, where an estimated 100 million cups are drunk every day.
But now a scientist based more than 3,000 miles (5,000km) away in the US claims to have found the secret to a perfect cuppa that many Brits would initially find absolutely absurd - adding salt.
Prof Michelle Francl's research has caused quite the stir in the UK, and has even drawn a diplomatic intervention from the US embassy.
""We want to ensure the good people of the UK that the unthinkable notion of adding salt to Britain's national drink is not official United States policy. And never will be,"" the embassy said on X, formerly known as Twitter.
It is not the first time the drink has caused controversy on both sides of the Atlantic.
Back in 1773, demonstrators in Boston, colonial Massachusetts, threw 300 chests full of tea into the harbour in protest at British taxes - a key moment which sparked the American Revolution.
""I certainly did not mean to cause a diplomatic incident,"" Prof Francl, a professor of chemistry at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, tells the BBC.
""My emails have been going crazy today. I did not anticipate waking up this morning to see loads of people talking about salt in their tea.""
So why add salt?
It turns out that it is not a new idea - the ingredient is even mentioned in Eighth Century Chinese manuscripts, which Prof Francl analysed to perfect her recipe.
""What is new is our understanding of it as chemists,"" Prof Francl said.
This video can not be played
Watch: Prof Michelle Francl speaks about controversial salt in tea idea
She explains that salt acts as a blocker to the receptor which makes tea taste bitter, especially when it has been stewed.
By adding a pinch of table salt - an undetectable amount - you will counteract the bitterness of the drink.
""It is not like adding sugar. I think people are afraid they will be able to taste the salt.""
She urges tea-loving Brits to have an open mind before prejudging her research, which she has documented in her new book Steeped: The Chemistry of Tea, published by the Royal Society of Chemistry.
""It is OK to experiment,"" she says. ""I did experiments in my kitchen for this - channel your inner scientist.""
Prof Francl has loved tea ever since her mother made her first brew when she was 10 years old.
Everyone has their own opinion on what makes the perfect cuppa, but Prof Francl recommends using loose leaves instead of tea bags and giving the drink a constant stir so the tea gets a good exposure to the water and milk.
Adding a small squeeze of lemon juice can also remove the ""scum"" that sometimes appears on the surface of the drink, she adds.
Other suggestions she makes include using short, stout mugs to keep the tea hotter, and warming up the mug and milk, with the latter added in only after pouring the tea.
But chief among her advice is to never, ever heat up the water in a microwave: ""It's less healthy and it does not taste as good,"" Prof Francl says.
""You end up getting tea scum forming on the surface, and that scum contains some of the antioxidants and taste compounds.""
While the concept of microwaving tea might sound a bit alien in the UK, it is ""totally common"" in the US.
""Americans have some truly awful tea-making habits,"" Prof Francl says.
""I have had better cups of tea at service stations in Ireland than I have had at fancy restaurants in the US.
""I think it is just that people do not know [how to make a good cuppa]. If you do not drink tea, you do not know you are making a horrible cup of tea for someone and giving them a miserable experience.""
She says she loves coming to the UK, where she knows she will be able to locate a decent brew.
""I know when I land I can get a great cup of tea. It is good to have that common ground,"" she says.
So, what next for British-American tea relations?
The US embassy is not heeding Prof Francl's advice and says it will stick to what it calls the ""proper way"" of making tea - by microwaving it - while the UK Cabinet Office is adamant it can only be made using a kettle.

863K4XVK3E_AOXQK7G4UB4TNBK,Hospital missed opportunities before baby's death - coroner,By Kris Holland,3 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-68055798,"Missed opportunities to treat a nine-month-old baby ""probably contributed to her death"" in hospital, a coroner's report said.
Iona Buckingham died at Northampton General Hospital in December 2022 after complications from bronchiolitis.
Coroner Jonathan Dixey said the hospital missed opportunities to administer an antibiotic and carry out an X-ray and chest ultrasound.
A hospital spokesperson said they were ""saddened"" by the death.
In a Prevention of Future Deaths report (PFDR) published after an inquest into the baby's death, Mr Dixey said Iona was admitted to Northampton General on 28 November 2022 for oxygen therapy and feeding support ""in view of a diagnosis of bronchiolitis"".
A chest X-ray was performed the following day and pneumonia was identified, and she was given antibiotics. The report added that Iona was moved down from high-dependency care as she appeared to show improvement.
Mr Dixey said that there was a ""missed opportunity"" on 29 November to administer clindamycin, an antibiotic, which may have contributed to Iona's death.
During a review on 3 December - a Saturday - Iona was found to be struggling to breathe and there was a further missed opportunity to carry out an X-ray, administer clindamycin and arrange for transfer to a tertiary centre for the purpose of undertaking a chest drain, the report said.
The coroner said these matters ""probably"" contributed to Iona's death during an ""accidental extubation"".
She died on 4 December ""as a result of bronchopneumonia with empyema due to invasive Group A streptococcal infection"", an inquest concluded.
Mr Dixey warned that ""future deaths could occur"" if children with pneumonia could not get ""immediate"" access to X-ray and chest ultrasounds.
He said the absence of a paediatric radiologist outside of 09:00-17:00 meant that a child may not receive an ultrasound scan for up to 48 hours if the need arose.
In a statement, a hospital spokesperson said: ""We are reviewing the recommendations from the coroner and will be responding within the specified timeframe.
""We are working closely with all system partners across Northamptonshire to discuss the findings and will work together to assess and implement any actions that can be taken.""
Northampton General Hospital has until 8 March to respond to the report.

The campaign showed a picture of two primary school-aged girls under the slogan: ""Make those heads turn in H&M's Back to School fashion.""
The advert in Australia has now been withdrawn and H&M has apologised.
Mumsnet founder and chief executive Justine Roberts said the advert ""should never have been created in the first place"".
The campaign was criticised by people on social media, with one labelling it ""vile"" and another ""disgusting"".
In a statement, H&M said it had removed the ad, which was only live in Australia.
""We are deeply sorry for the offence this has caused and will look into how we present campaigns going forward.""
Ms Roberts said: ""Mumsnet users have long been concerned about a sexualised culture creeping into the lives of children - which is why we launched our Let Girls Be Girls campaign in 2010.""
The campaign calls on retailers to commit not to sell products which play upon, emphasise or exploit children's sexuality.
Ms Roberts added: ""It's disappointing to see that, 14 years later, retailers are still creating inappropriate adverts that prematurely sexualise young girls.
""While we're pleased that H&M have accepted their mistake and removed the advert, it really should never have been created in the first place.""
Last year, online retailer Temu had an advert banned by the UK's advertising watchdog for sexualising a child.
The ad showed a girl aged between eight and 11 wearing a bikini in a pose that ""was quite adult for a girl of her age"", the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said.
The watchdog also banned four other adverts for showing sexual images and pictures that objectified women.

Canada has been pushing for the UK to relax a ban on hormone-treated beef, which its producers say in effect shuts them out of the British market.
The UK have concerns about 245% import taxes Canada put at the start of the year on British cheese.
The pause in talks mean British car firms could also face higher tariffs.
It will also mean the UK's trading terms with Canada will now be worse than when it was part of the EU's deal with the country.
Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers' Union of England and Wales, said she was glad the UK government had not ""given way"" on hormone-treated beef.
But the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) described the news as unwelcome.
Downing Street said the government would ""only negotiate deals that deliver for the British people"", and reserved the right to ""pause negotiations where progress is not being made"".
But a spokesperson added: ""We're open to restarting talks with Canada in the future.""
No 10 dismissed a suggestion that Brexit had left the UK worse off in terms of international trade, saying it was a ""benefit of our independent trading status that we are able to insist on the detail of each and every deal to ensure that it works specifically in the UK's interests"".
Trade between the two countries currently takes place under the terms of a deal the UK rolled over from its time as an EU member.
A time-limited agreement allowed the UK to continue to sell cars and cheese without high import taxes. But talks about extending these as part of a new deal have now broken down.
The arrangements for cheese ended on 31st December 2023 leading to taxes of up to 245% on British imports, while the car deal is due to expire in April.
This is the first time the UK has formally suspended talks with a trade partner since formally leaving the EU trading regime in 2021.
Talks between the two countries on reaching a bespoke agreement had been taking place since March 2022.
A spokeswoman for Canada's trade minister Mary Ng said she was ""disappointed"" at the pause in talks, and had communicated this to UK Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch.
""Their decision to continue to maintain market access barriers for our agriculture industry and unwillingness to reach a mutual agreement has only stalled negotiations,"" the spokeswoman added.
""The UK is a long-standing trading partner and I am confident that we can negotiate an agreement that is win-win for Canada and for the UK.
""But let me be clear - we will not negotiate an agreement that is not good for Canadians - and not good for our Canadian businesses, farmers and workers"".
Total goods trade between the two countries was worth Â£19.2bn in 2020, according to the UK government, with UK imports from Canada worth Â£7.3bn and UK exports to Canada worth Â£11.8bn.
Ms Batters said the UK's decision would be a ""relief for farmers"".
She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she was pleased the ""government has stuck to its line and not given way"".
""We have already damaged our economy and agricultural sector by fully liberalising on trade deals with Australia and New Zealand. We had to take a strong line on this.""
However, William Bain, trade policy head at the BCC, said: ""For our dairy exporters and parts of our manufacturing industry the loss of key trade preferences puts them in a worse position than before 2020.
""Government must help these sectors through difficult times and open up new markets for our goods and services.""
Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT, said the breakdown in talks sent ""a signal that the UK's world-class automotive products are not welcome in Canada"".
""If UK car exports can't use EU parts and components to avoid additional duties it creates a risk that tariffs, potentially charged on top of luxury goods taxes, could be reintroduced,"" he added.
The Canadian Cattle Association said it backed its government's ""hard-line approach"" on beef rules, adding that the UK had ""shown no indication that it is prepared to fully accept Canada's food safety system which is widely recognized as one of the finest in the world"".
Labour's shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: ""This is very concerning news and another significant failure from the Conservatives to honour their promises.
""Rather than strengthening our trading position post-Brexit these failures have left us in a weaker position, particularly for the automotive sector.""
SNP international trade spokesperson Richard Thomson said: ""Westminster's Brexit has damaged the UK's potential for global trade and has dragged Scotland's economy down with it.""
Former Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC the UK was ""absolutely right to suspend negotiations"", and that Canada should ""accept the need to comply with British food standards"".
Mr Eustice, who was fiercely critical of the UK-Australia trade deal, said the government had to ensure that ""any access granted for hormone free beef from Canada is matched with access for UK dairy into the Canadian market"".
Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle expressed frustration that the halting of the talks was announced to the media before MPs.
""I will say it is amazing how quickly the government come to give good news... I always believe this House should hear it first,"" he said.

8G0Q0MTY3J_FXGM4QNAEQGASKW,Manchester to Dublin flight detour due to Storm Isha was 'crazy',By Stewart Whittingham & Chris Long,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-68059238,"A passenger who was on a flight from Manchester to Dublin that had to divert to Paris due to Storm Isha has said it had been like riding a rodeo bull.
The Ryanair flight from Manchester to Dublin on Sunday was forced to change its destination after high winds made it unsafe to land in Ireland.
Declan Cassidy said when it eventually landed 450 miles away at Paris Beauvais Airport, ""everyone started cheering"".
""I was glad to be on the ground in one piece,"" the filmmaker added.
Mr Cassidy documented his long ordeal on TikTok, which began at 15:00 GMT on Sunday, and captured the pilot announcing the detour and the moment his fellow passengers applauded as their expected 35-minute flight eventually arrived in Dublin 11 hours after it set off.
He said they were originally told they would return to Manchester, before being diverted to East Midlands Airport, but when that was deemed unsafe, Paris became their new destination.
He said they were subsequently told if conditions were not good in Paris, they might have to land in Cologne in Germany.
He added it was ""crazy"" being on board in the storm.
""We took off and the pilot tried to land in Dublin, but he aborted several times,"" he said.
""It was crazy [and] like being on one of those bulls that throw you off.""
He said the flight ""tried to go back to Manchester, but they could not take any more planes"".
""We were also told we could not go East Midlands Airport, but then ended up on the tarmac in Paris,"" he said.
""Everyone started cheering.
""I was glad to be on the ground in one piece.
""At least we are on the ground.""
Ryanair has been contacted for comment.
Mr Cassidy's flight was one of a number that had to make huge diversions due to the weather.
Planes heading for Bristol and London also ended up in Paris, while several Edinburgh-bound planes landed in Cologne.

Stefan Farbrother, who was living in Sevenoaks, Kent at the time, was convicted of a string of offences, including multiple rapes, over a period of five years.
Det Sgt Adam Ferguson from Kent Police said Farbrother, 47, subjected the victim to ""the most appalling and terrifying campaign of abuse"".
At Maidstone Crown Court, he was sentenced to 18 years in prison.
Concerns were initially reported to Kent Police in 2018, which led to the arrest of Farbrother in June that year.
An investigation resulted in him facing 13 charges, including seven offences of rape and multiple indecent assaults, relating to incidents between 1991 and 1997, police said.
Farbrother, who was later living in Stanningley Road, Halifax, West Yorkshire, denied any wrongdoing but was convicted by unanimous verdict on all counts.
He was sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment and added to the sex offenders register for life.
Det Sgt Ferguson said Farbrother used violence and threats, which included restraining the victim with handcuffs and holding a knife to their throat.
""The abuse has had a catastrophic effect on much of their adult life, but I do hope they can now move forward from this knowing Farbrother will be serving a lengthy prison sentence,"" he said.

8IH8DQGDEH_WKSVCCXZ3VCW3RX,"Constance Marten trial: Dead baby 'well cared for' by parents, court told",By Simon Jones & Oliver Slow,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68105698,"The trial of a mother and father accused of killing their baby has been told she was ""well cared for"" by her parents.
Constance Marten, 36, and Mark Gordon, 49, are on trial for the manslaughter of newborn Victoria, whose body was discovered in a Lidl 'bag for life' in March 2023.
Mr Gordon's lawyer suggested they were ""driven off grid"" after police began a weeks-long search for the family.
The pair deny the charges.
Ms Marten and Mr Gordon were arrested near Brighton on 27 February 2023, and their baby's body was discovered two days later in a nearby shed.
The trial has previously heard the couple were living rough in a bid to evade social services as they feared their newborn child would be removed.
Prosecutors allege the baby died as a result of living outdoors in wintry conditions, but in an opening address to the jury, John Femi-Ola KC, who is defending Mr Gordon, said: ""The baby was kept warm and dry, and was fed such as she was well-nourished. The baby did not require medical assistance.""
He said there was no evidence of any sign of violence, and no sign of external or internal injuries.
Mr Femi-Ola said there was no intention by the couple to pervert the course of justice by deliberately allowing Victoria's body to decompose, because Ms Marten wanted a post-mortem examination to know ""how her beloved baby died"".
On Friday, the jury was also played footage taken by Ken Hudson, a motorist who passed the couple's car after it burst into flames on the M61 in Greater Manchester on 5 January.
This video can not be played

Mr Hudson told the court he pulled over and dialled 999, then saw a man ""frantically"" removing possessions from the burning car, and a woman with a baby getting out.
Ms Marten told him the infant was fine, Mr Hudson said, and that he did not need to wait with them any longer by the side of the road.
In the footage, Mr Hudson can be heard refusing an offer from Mr Gordon of money in exchange for a possible lift to the nearest service station. The lift never happened, he said.
Asked if he heard any noise or movement from the baby, he said ""none whatsoever"", and told the court he put his hand on the infant's head and said ""God bless"".
Mr Hudson said the baby ""felt quite cold, but it was January, and it didn't move at all"", adding he was ""cut up because I believe that if I stayed with the vehicle, the baby may be still alive.""
He rejected the defence's suggestion Ms Marten would not have allowed a stranger to place his hand on the baby's head, and maintained the exchange happen.
The prosecution maintains baby Victoria would still be alive were it not for the ""reckless, utterly selfish, callous, cruel, arrogant and ultimately grossly negligent conduct"" of her parents.
Outlining the case against the defendants on Thursday, prosecutor Tom Little KC told jurors the couple previously had four other children, all of whom had been taken into care after extensive involvement from social services.
The court has heard the couple were living in a tent on the South Downs - which the prosecution says deprived the baby of what it needed, namely warmth, food and safety.
Mr Little said the conditions the defendants were living when sleeping rough ""rapidly worsened and quickly reached a stage that were inhuman"", and accused them of putting their ""own relationship and desires over the safety and wellbeing of their baby"".
But Mr Femi-Ola for the defence said: ""The Crown say they went off the grid. As you listen to the evidence, you may ask yourself: were they driven off the grid?""
On Thursday, jurors were told Ms Marten comes from a privileged background and had access to money.
The court was also told Ms Marten received Â£15,590 from ""Hoare Trustees"" into her bank account on 22 December. She received a further Â£3,400 from the ""Sturt Trust"" on 3 January.
As well as manslaughter, the couple are also accused of four other offences - cruelty to their baby; concealment of the baby's birth; causing or allowing her death; and perverting the course of justice by concealing the body.
The trial continues."
8LMVOKCHJ7_Q7CRNR0YE77VNT2,"Threats against Sir Jeffrey Donaldson reported to PSNI, says DUP",By Brendan Hughes,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-68097829,"A ""threat of violence"" against Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has been reported to police, the party has said.
It comes after the DUP leader told MPs he had been threatened due to a ""stirring up"" of tensions over the party's talks on Brexit trade rules.
He made the remarks on Wednesday during a speech in the Commons.
He told MPs he would not be ""deflected"" in his efforts to reach a deal to restore Stormont power-sharing.
The DUP has been blocking a resumption of Northern Ireland's devolved institutions since 2022 in protest over post-Brexit trade checks between the region and Great Britain.
It has been in talks with the UK government seeking changes to the arrangements agreed with the EU in a deal called the Windsor Framework.
Sir Jeffrey told the Commons: ""I was threatened by those who never put on a uniform, by those who haven't served our country, and when I checked out one of the people who threatened me, they weren't even on the register. They didn't vote at the last election.
""They can't even come out to vote for our future in the union. Yet they're threatening people like me who are working day and night to find solutions.""
In a statement on Thursday, the DUP said details were reported to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).
""The details have been reported to the PSNI and we trust those responsible will be held accountable for their actions,"" a party spokesman said.
""There is no place for the threat of violence in democratic politics.""
In a statement, a PSNI spokesman said: ""Police have received a report and have launched an investigation.""
Sir Jeffrey was speaking as the Commons passed a bill to extend the deadline for restoring devolution to 8 February - giving the DUP more time to decide whether to return to power-sharing.
In an impassioned speech he hit out at his unionist critics, saying that some were attempting to ""orchestrate opposition to a deal that has not yet taken place"".
He said there was a ""tiny minority"" who did not want devolution restored and would prefer ""imperfect direct rule than an imperfect Stormont"".
Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris condemned those who had threatened the DUP leader.
""The fact he's been threatened for doing what he has been doing is a disgrace,"" he said in the Commons.
Mr Heaton-Harris added that he hoped politicians would soon be back ""celebrating"" the return of Stormont's power-sharing government.
Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood said those who threatened Sir Jeffrey ""couldn't lace his boots"".
""We are in a more hopeful place than we have been. If this today symbolises we are getting closer to a resolution we have to welcome it and give it space.""
Alliance Party MP Stephen Farry described the tone of Sir Jeffrey's speech as ""encouraging"" on the prospect of restoring devolution.
The debate followed a major strike in Northern Ireland last week involving tens of thousands of public sector workers taking industrial action in a dispute over pay.

8M2CG0RYZA_Z5UW0WZHWR3IM2F,"Rita Waeni killing: Two Nigerians held in Kenya over studentâs death, police say",By Gloria Aradi,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-68065629,"Two further suspects have been arrested over the murder and mutilation of a student in Kenya.
In a killing that shocked the country, the dismembered remains of Rita Waeni, 20, were discovered in rubbish bags at a rental apartment in the capital, Nairobi, on 14 January.
Her head was missing, along with her phone and other personal items.
The two men, who Kenyan police say are Nigerian, have appeared in court but have not yet been charged.
Police asked a magistrate for permission to keep the men in custody until 31 January, as their investigations were continuing. The magistrate granted their request.
Ms Waeni's murder has led to calls for more to be done to address violence against women.
Four Kenyans are also in custody in relation to the killing, as well as one person who had been travelling on a Mozambican passport and was picked up as he tried to leave the country.
Police have named the two new suspects being held as William Ovie Opia,and Johnbull Asbor.
Mr Opia had an expired Nigerian passport and Mr Asbor had lost his passport two years ago, police said.
The police seized several items from the suspects' apartment, including a butcher's knife and small axe suspected to have been used in the killing and mutilation of the university student, according to Kenyan media quoting the police.
Mr Opia told investigators that he bought the axe online for self-defence, the privately owned Nation newspaper reported.
The two men were arrested in Ndenderu, a town about 20km (12 miles) from Nairobi and near a dam where the police recovered a head suspected to be Ms Waeni's, along with her phone and some of her missing items.
Ms Waeni's family have so far been unable to identify the recovered head.
The family said last week that those responsible demanded a ransom of 500,000 Kenyan shillings ($3,100; Â£2,400) to release Ms Waeni, even after she had died.
The gruesome way in which her body was dealt with has shocked people, including the chief government pathologist Johansen Oduor, who said he had ""never come across such an incident"" in his forensic career.
Human rights and feminist groups have planned countrywide demonstrations to protest against what they see as a surge in femicide and violence against women.
There has been a spate of reported violent killings of women since the beginning of the year. A survey carried out in 2022 found that at least 34% of women said they had experienced physical violence at some point in their lives.

The bodies of Jasmin Kuczynska, 12, and Natasha Kuczynska, eight, were found in Costessey, near Norwich, on Friday.
Detectives confirmed they were treating their deaths and that of Kanticha Sukpengpanao, 36, as murder.
Ms Sukpengpanao and Bartlomiej Kuczynski, 45, were earlier found to have died from stab wounds to the neck.
All four bodies were discovered by police officers at a house in Allan Bedford Crescent, Queen's Hills.
Police said Mr Kuczynski's death was not being treated as suspicious and they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the murders.
Norfolk Police has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) over the case.
On Tuesday, the IOPC confirmed Mr Kuczynski called 999 shortly before 06:00 GMT from inside the house.
He said he was confused and worried about his mental state.
It is understood he was advised to seek medical advice and contact the NHS on 111.
Police were not despatched until after they received a second 999 call at 07:00 GMT from a member of the public and forced their way into the house.
The IOPC said it would be examining whether the handling of the contact with the first call ""was appropriate and in line with force policy, training and procedures"".
The IOPC's regional director Charmaine Arbouin said they would also ""be making contact with the families of the deceased to explain our role"".
Det Ch Insp Chris Burgess said: ""We understand how incredibly shocking this incident is for all involved and for the wider community and that this latest update adds to the sense of heartbreak.
""Our thoughts are with the family of the those found at the property grieving such a traumatic loss.""
He said a cordon would remain at the address ""whilst we finalise our detailed examination of the scene"".
The police previously said Natasha was nine years old, which they later corrected.

In addition to China's slow recovery, the firm's executives blamed anti-Japanese sentiment.
Last year, Japan started releasing treated radioactive water from its Fukushima nuclear power plant which was hit by a huge tsunami in 2011.
China opposed the move and banned all seafood imports from Japan, despite the UN's assurance of its safety.
Scientists also largely agree that the environmental impact of the treated water will be negligible but as disinformation fuelled fear and suspicion in China, consumers boycotted Japanese brands, including P&G's SK-II.
Rocks were also thrown at Japanese schools and hundreds of hostile phone calls were also made to businesses in Fukushima.
But P&G executives said SK-II is already seeing sales turn around in recent months.
""Our consumer research indicates SK-II brand sentiment is improving, and we expect to see sequential improvement in the back half,"" the company's chief financial officer, Andre Schulten, was quoted as saying on the company's earnings conference call.
This is not the first time SK-II or Japanese brands face a boycott in China.
In 2012, a wave of anti-Japanese protests across China over a territorial dispute led to a halt in production at Japanese carmakers, Toyota, Honda and Nissan, whose showrooms were attacked.
Other Japanese companies affected included the electronics company Sony, fast fashion brand Uniqlo and the shopping chain stores Aeon.
The islands, known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, are controlled by Japan but both China and Taiwan lay claim to them.
P&G's chief executive officer, Jon Moeller, said on the earnings call that previous tensions have also hurt SK-II's sales, but the brand always bounced back.
The company's overall earnings were mixed as the firm cut its annual profit forecast due to a one-off charge related to its Gillette business.
But demand for the company's daily-use products, mainly in the grooming and home-care segments, remained strong despite high prices.

The Rev Leah Vasey-Saunders said depictions of Sophia Fileen, baptised at Lancaster Priory in 1799, was ""part of our journey"" in addressing history.
The church has also chosen not to remove graffiti about its slave trade links from a protest in 2020.
Lancaster was the fourth largest UK port in the transatlantic slave trade.
Three sculptures of Sophia are now being displayed in collaboration with arts organisation Facing the Past, which works to ""redress omissions"" in how Lancaster has marked its part in the trade.
Lancaster Priory said it wanted to highlight the ""crimes against humanity"" by people associated with the church.
Lancaster Priory - along with other churches - is among several British institutions examining their links to the transatlantic slave trade, including the Royal Family, banks and universities.
Ms Vasey-Saunders told BBC North West Tonight it was ""really important that we are telling stories about the past"".
Referring to her church, she said: ""It's something that we want to acknowledge, we don't want to hide it. We want to be honest about it.""
Ms Vasey-Saunders said visitors sometimes asked why the sculptures were being hosted in the church.
""The minute you say these are part of our journey in addressing the history that we have in connection with transatlantic slavery, people go, 'Ah, oh yeah, that makes perfect sense.'""
Schoolchildren from Sierra Leone - from where it is believed more than 400,000 people were kidnapped and taken as part of the transatlantic slave trade - were involved in making three sculptures of Sophia.
The young girl was among at least 76 black Africans on the church registers.
She was baptised on 15 February 1799, recorded as ""a negro aged 11 years of Lancaster"".
One of the children involved in the sculpture project said she was ""very excited because I was able to be part of making memories of Sophia"".
Sam Ud-din, from Facing the Past, added they were involved in other schemes to ""improve the education"" in Lancaster's schools, and were also considering developing the city's current walking trail about the slave trade.
""We've been looking at whether or not there should be permanent new monuments,"" he added.

8XRHA5QW5C_OQDM4MJ9DADSF1W,Community explores reopening rail stop closed in 1960,Steven McKenzie,24 January 2024,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cge7y4e8nqgo,"Edderton Community Council chairman Gordon Allison
A small community in Easter Ross is looking into the potential of having its first rail stop since 1960.
Edderton's station was opened in 1865 but shut more than 63 years ago to help cut 40 minutes off journey times on the line between Inverness and Wick.
The local community council has completed a survey of residents' views on the idea of re-establishing a stop, and a next step would be to produce a business case.
Council chairman Gordon Allison said: ""The train line is very much a pulse connecting us all - I just want Edderton to be part of that.""

Listen to news from the Highlands and Islands on BBC Sounds
Edderton has a population of a few hundred people.
It is the site of ancient standing stones, which are part of a Highland Pictish Trail, and the village's Balblair Distillery was used as a location in the 2012 Ken Loach film Angel's Share.
Trains still pass through Edderton on the Far North Line between Inverness, Wick and Thurso.
The nearest available station is about seven miles (11km) away in Tain.
The community council has suggested the building of a new short platform to facilitate a ""request stop"" service.
Edderton is home to a few hundred people
The council's survey of about 300-400 households in Edderton and surrounding area received 100 responses, with 90% of people saying they would use the stop if available.
Popular destinations included Tain and Inverness, while some said they would use the train to travel north to Lairg, Wick and Thurso.
Mr Allison, who is also treasurer of the Far North Line Community Rail Partnership, said the proposals were in the very early stages but hoped they could be progressed.
He said: ""Every day I drive over the railway and it just struck me it was a little incongruous to pass this railway which has got commuter services.""
Mr Allison said a rail stop would help reduce car journeys, and could be important for commuters working in businesses linked to the proposed Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport.
Transport Scotland said there were processes for community transport proposals to follow, including reviews done in line with Scottish Transport Appraisal Guidance.
A spokesman said: âAlthough reopening Edderton rail station does not feature in the Scottish governmentâs current investment programme, we are committed to ongoing improvements to rail services and connectivity.
""Projects will be considered subject to the Scottish governmentâs investment priorities for the strategic transport network, a robust business case, affordability and other competing proposals."""
8ZTVQBQFJ2_1MPQLJRS599FPSZ,"Fire destroys almost entire Abkhazia art collection of 4,000 works",By Rayhan Demytrie,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68059206,"A fire has destroyed almost the entire art collection of Abkhazia, the breakaway region of Georgia that is controlled by Russia.
More than 4,000 paintings at the National Art Gallery in the capital Sukhumi were lost in the blaze.
It spread quickly inside the early 20th Century building which had a wooden structure and was home to an entire collection of Abkhazian art.
Investigators say an electrical short circuit may have started the fire.
A video on social media showed intense flames inside the gallery.
Among the destroyed artworks were 300 pieces by the renowned artist and stage designer Alexander Chachba-Shervashidze.
The director of the national gallery, Suram Sakanya, said the collection had survived Abkhazia's civil war with Georgia in the 1990s and was an irreparable loss for Abkhaz culture.
""We have been gathering this collection since 1963 and it went up in flames in seconds. Such a tragedy for us here in Abkhazia,"" the director said.
Local artists had long been demanding a more suitable location to store the unique art collection. A video taken before the fire showed paintings stacked together in two cramped rooms without adequate protection.
Abkhazia, which gets military and financial support from Moscow, lies in the north-western corner of Georgia and borders Russia.
The region fought a war of secession with Georgia from 1992-93 and declared independence in 1999, but has little international recognition.
Since the Georgian-Russian war of 2008, Moscow has recognised it as an independent state. Georgia says Abkhazia is occupied by Russia.
Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili said the fire was ""a tragedy for us all"".
""I deplore what is a direct consequence of the neglect of cultural identity both by the de facto leadership and the Russian occupants,"" she posted on X, formerly Twitter.

96YV22WDYU_B4JG4CU7RYJ9BLU,DUP's Edwin Poots: We're not traitors on Stormont boycott,By Brendan Hughes,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-68105094,"The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) are not ""traitors"" in efforts to reach a deal to restore Stormont power sharing, their former leader has said.
Edwin Poots insisted the DUP was ""working extremely hard"" to resolve the deadlock and those labelling the party as traitors were ""idiots"".
Northern Ireland's devolved government collapsed in 2022 after the DUP withdrew in protest over post-Brexit trade checks between the region and Great Britain.
The party has been in talks with the UK government seeking changes to the arrangements which were agreed with the EU in a deal called the Windsor Framework.
The DUP believes the trade rules diminish Northern Ireland's place within the UK internal market, creating a so-called Irish Sea border.
A bill was passed through Parliament on Wednesday to extend the deadline for restoring devolution to 8 February - giving the DUP more time to decide whether to return to power sharing.
But the party has been under pressure from unionist rivals not to compromise on their demands.
In an impassioned speech in the Commons, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said some people were attempting to ""orchestrate opposition to a deal that has not yet taken place"".
Mr Poots, a Stormont assembly member, told the BBC's Nolan Show there had been a lot of ""ill-informed"" speculation about the party's internal discussions.
""The people who are running about suggesting the DUP are traitors - why would we have done what we have done for the last two years and then go back with nothing, just for idiots to say that?""
The former Stormont agriculture and environment minister added: ""There is a course of work that has been done thus far, and that's a course of work that's ongoing, and we are determined to bring that to a conclusion.""
Mr Poots would not be drawn on whether he believes the DUP's seven tests - on which the party has said they will judge any deal - must be met before resuming Stormont power sharing.
""The position is expressed in private meetings. Whenever the party comes to a final position, we will report the final position whatever that happens to be,"" he said.
In the last assembly election in May 2022, Sinn FÃ©in became the largest party at Stormont for the first time, pushing the DUP into second place.
But Stormont's structures for power sharing between unionists and nationalists mean an executive cannot be restored without the support of both parties.
In December, the Northern Ireland secretary said talks with the DUP over the Windsor Framework had ""effectively concluded"".
Chris Heaton-Harris also offered a Â£3.3bn financial package for Northern Ireland dependent upon the Stormont institutions being restored.
Last week a major strike was held in Northern Ireland involving tens of thousands of public sector workers taking industrial action in a dispute over pay.

97UO1DNUGC_3TXA1T4ETTCQWCO,"In Ukraine's river war, drones mean nowhere is safe",By James Waterhouse,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-67991772,"There are few places from where you can see Russian-occupied territory with the naked eye in Ukraine.
The western bank of the Dnipro river in the city of Kherson is one of them.
You can't see the Russian troops on the other low, marshy riverbank, but you know they're there.
Incoming artillery fire as we arrive at an abandoned building serves as a sharp reminder.
There is nothing new about shelling in war. But the unit we're meeting deals with one of the key innovations of this invasion: drones.
As we hug the side of the building and take cover in the stairwell, we're led inside from the freezing winter winds to the warmth of a militarised living room.
The smell of a strawberry vape hangs above these Ukrainian soldiers, sitting on armchairs with looks of quiet focus and cans of Monster energy drink. You imagine the floral wallpaper wasn't their choice.
Artem, a 20-year-old pilot, suddenly sits up. They're told the Russians have launched drones from across the water.
""It's from a location known to us,"" explains Tymur, commander of the Samosud squad in Ukraine's 11th National Guard Brigade.
""Our goal is to destroy the pilots. We have the coordinates, so we're flying there right now.""
There are at least a dozen drones on the floor - all loaded with grenades. A cat, the unit's unofficial mascot, nuzzles against one of the propellers.
One drone is taken outside as Artem puts on his VR headset.
We watch on the TV as he flies it across the river into occupied territory. From this vantage point, there are no obvious signs of life.
A few kilometres later, Artem's drone arrives at an industrial area. It passes a warehouse before hovering next to a block of flats.
He eventually spots an antenna next to a window in the stairwell, and flies straight into it. The screen turns blue. Artem exhales and removes his headset.
""When we first did this it was emotional,"" says Artem. ""Now this is business as usual.""
""I didn't get enough time to play computer games before [the full-scale invasion]. Now I'm catching up!""
They launch another drone but the screen turns blue as soon as it crosses the river. The Russians have turned on their jamming system.
A third then makes the same journey. This time it makes it through, and Artem returns to the block of flats.
He's able to confirm the antenna was destroyed. With 10 minutes of battery life left, he flies off to see what else he can detect, or destroy.
His unit has been targeting a main road which the Russians use to deliver supplies. Civilians are banned from driving there, so the Ukrainian drone pilots hit anything with wheels.
Artem spots a Russian checkpoint and flies towards it. Unfortunately for him, they use a jamming gun and the screen turns blue as he gets close. He exhales again.
""No matter how many times we hit the same places, [the Russians] are constantly replenished,"" says Tymur. ""They're kind of fearless.""
With each drone costing around $500 (Â£396), it's a constant cycle of launch, seek and destroy.
The returns however can be significant. Tymur says his team once destroyed an S-350 air defence missile system worth $136m.
Drones mean the Russians can't hide anywhere within 10km (six miles) of the front line.
But, crucially, the invaders are doing exactly the same to the Ukrainians.
Under constant drone surveillance and enemy bombardment, life has gradually drained from Kherson's streets. Aside from a limited crossing further up the Dnipro near the town of Krynky, Ukrainian attacks here are only probing, and require patience.
READ: Outnumbered and outgunned by Russians in brutal riverside battle
In a snow-covered park in Kherson, we meet a mobile air-defence team under an archway. We're told to move in small groups because of watching Russian drones.
As we stride forward in our body armour, dog-walkers turn away from us with a slight look of confusion.
""My call sign is King,"" says a unit deputy commander in the 124th Territorial Defence Brigade, with a fist bump. They're gathered around a UK-registered truck with a .50 calibre machine gun mounted on the back.
""We work 24/7,"" he says. ""We destroy all kinds of drones, mainly Iranian-made Shaheds.""
""Russia's factories are on a military footing. They are constantly increasing their power. At this point, it's relentless.""
So does King think Ukrainian forces could cross the river in large numbers this year?
""It's hard to think about,"" he replies. ""We're just doing our jobs to make sure it happens as soon as possible.""
With major military packages trapped under political disagreements in the US and European Union, Ukraine is having to adapt, and look inwards.
A new Â£2.5bn military aid package from the UK has been welcomed here, with Â£200m of that earmarked specifically for drones. But President Volodymyr Zelensky has also pledged to make a million of them within the borders of Ukraine.
On the outskirts of Kherson in an icy field, pilots practise drone flights with plastic bottles tied beneath them, in place of grenades.
It takes just 14 hours of training to qualify as a drone pilot. Ukraine's government is encouraging people to take part in free training, as well as to manufacture drones at home to send to the front.
Through his balaclava, Stitch explains their importance in this war of attrition.
""We are engaged in a struggle of technologies, an arms race: who will be the first to invent what, who will assemble something cool,"" the drone commander says.
It's widely accepted that several innovations now need to happen at once for the front lines to change significantly.
Ukraine's commander-in-chief Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyy told the Economist magazine in November that Russia and Ukraine had ""reached the level of technology that puts us into a stalemate"".
The problem for Ukraine has never been what has been supplied by allies, but when.
""During the First World War, aviation was born,"" says Stitch. ""Now we are starting the future war of drones, which maybe in two decades will turn the tide of any war.""

Karen Furnass said she had woken up to find the reptile hanging from a ledge above the front door inside her home in Heaton Mersey, Stockport.
She said she had struggled to get help to remove it and feared it was now hiding under the floorboards.
""I am not staying here with the snake in my house"", the 59-year-old said.
She has decided to book an Airbnb after she found the snake in her home on New Beech Road.
""At first I thought it was a bit of material,"" she told BBC Radio Manchester.
Ms Furnass, who owns a beauty parlour in Yorkshire, said she immediately shut the lounge door and took her dog upstairs, before the snake disappeared down a crack in doorway.
She said police officers had come to her house and despite being a ""bit scared to come in"", they helped search ""under cushions, in the cellar"".
A Greater Manchester Police spokeswoman said the force had attended but could not locate the snake.
Ms Furnass said she had been ""passed from pillar to post"" by the RPSCA when she asked the animal charity for help.
The BBC has contacted the RSPCA for a response.
Ms Furnass said she had ""no idea"" how the reptile slithered in, but said it was ""proper scary"".
""Maybe it's been coming in every evening and I haven't seen it.""
Wildlife charity Amphibian and Reptile Conservation said: ""From the photographs provided, we believe this is a young corn snake.
""These are commonly kept as pets, are not venomous and are completely harmless to humans.""
The charity said it was ""likely it belongs to a nearby neighbour as it will not have travelled far"", adding that corn snakes were ""good at escaping their enclosures"".

Work will continue to restore power, ESB Networks says
More than 68,000 homes were without power on Monday night
A status orange wind warning has been issued for three counties on Tuesday as Met Ãireann names Storm Jocelyn
Thousands of homes in the Republic of Ireland remain without power following Storm Isha.
ESB Networks is working to restore power to about 68,000 homes, adding that some customers may be waiting for days.
The company said it had restored power to 167,000 homes, farms and businesses following the storm.
Another storm - Jocelyn - is due to hit the Republic of Ireland on Tuesday.
Status orange warnings will be in place on Tuesday from 18:00 local time until midnight for counties Galway and Mayo, and from 18:00 until 02:00 on Wednesday for Donegal.
A status yellow warning will be in place for all other counties from Tuesday afternoon until the early hours of Wednesday.
About 22,000 customers were without power in County Donegal on Monday afternoon, with areas in the north west of the country some of the worst impacted.
Some of the worst impacted areas in County Donegal were Ballyshannon (2,511 reports); Carndonagh (1,986) and in Buncrana (1,786).
The areas where customers will remain without supply overnight are mostly in  the north west of the country including counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Mayo and Sligo.
""All available ESB Networks resources, along with our partner contractors, will work into the night to safely restore power to as many customers as possible before mobilising again at first light tomorrow morning (Tuesday),"" ESB said.
""However, due to the scale of the damage to the electricity network, many customers will remain without power tonight while some customers will be without power for a number of days.""
Earlier, ESB senior engineer Brian Tapley told Irish broadcaster RTÃ it would be a ""multi-day"" storm repair.
""Storm Isha is probably in the top five storms in terms of the impact on the network that we've had in the last 10 years,"" he said.
""It shouldn't be underestimated the kind of restoration effort that's needed here.""
Uisce Ãireann said about 35,000 customers were hit by interruptions to their water supply following Storm Isha.
The worst affected areas were in Mayo and Donegal.

9DM4ML55LJ_FVTXURO08N0HMRN,"Jo Cox Foundation: Abuse of politicians is a threat to democracy, report says",By Sam Francis,5 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68073395,"The abuse and intimidation of politicians is a ""significant threat to democracy"", a new report has said.
The report by the Jo Cox Foundation, named after the MP murdered in 2016, says action needs to be taken to prevent elected representatives from stepping down.
It suggests social media firms should offer extra support to politicians during elections.
Research has found politicians face regular violent threats in their roles.
The Jo Cox Civility Commission highlighted research which found 90% of female members of the Scottish Parliament had feared for their safety and almost 43% of Welsh MPs and Senedd members had received a death threat.
Former home secretary Jacqui Smith, who now chairs the Jo Cox Foundation, said Parliament must act to ""prevent elected representatives from stepping down and ensure a diverse and talented future pipeline of politician"".
""Abuse and intimidation of elected politicians is a genuine threat to democracy in this country,"" Ms Smith said in a statement.
The report also highlights the case of Labour's Jess Phillips, former shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, who said she had received 600 rape threats via social media in one evening.
Research published in July 2023 and mentioned in the report also found London Mayor Sadiq Khan had received more than 300,000 pieces of openly racist or racially-oriented abuse since he was first elected.
Two MPs have been murdered in the last eight years, including Ms Cox. Sir David Amess was killed while holding an MP surgery in his Southend constituency in 2021.
The commission has made 28 recommendations it believes are needed to protect political figures while still allowing for robust debate.
They include giving teachers special training so they are able to show school children how to track down and evaluate sources of information and misinformation found online and in the media.
The report also recommended mandatory lessons on media literacy and promoting more informed and respectful debates in schools.
There is a direct correlation between the rise of social media and how easy it has become to abuse representatives, the report says.
To tackle this, the commission says social media firms must recognise the importance of politicians' democratic roles and offer quicker, better ways for councillors to report online abuse and misinformation.
During elections, platforms should provide politicians with additional help and online safety training, the report added.
Further police checks at politicians' homes and offices and the establishment of a central government-funded unit to tackle abuse are also among the recommendations.
The report has received praise from four former prime ministers, including Sir Tony Blair who called the recommendations ""a vital step"" towards making politics safer.
""Robust political debate is the cornerstone of a healthy democracy and is to be encouraged,"" Sir Tony said.
""Yet too often, our politics is dissolving into abuse, threats, and violence that only serve to undermine the democratic process.""
Gordon Brown said he hoped Ms Cox's death would be a ""turning point"" in the ""downward spiral"" in the UK's political culture.
Theresa May said ""a fitting tribute"" to her memory would be ""to take action on abuse and intimidation, which otherwise deters people from putting themselves forward and standing for election"".
Lord David Cameron, now foreign secretary, said: ""The Jo Cox Foundation has led this commission to show a way forward that makes our democracy safer and civil for those who are elected to represent us.""

9ERZZLL4HU_YUGXAYPIL2ATKOD,Norwich deaths: Police took father to hospital weeks before stabbings,By Rachael McMenemy and PA Media,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-68100719,"A father was taken to hospital by police weeks before he was found dead with his sister-in-law and two children.
Bartlomiej Kuczynski, 45, was found at a house in Costessey, near Norwich, on Friday, along with Jasmin Kuczynska, 12, Natasha Kuczynska, eight and Kanticha Sukpengpanao, 36,
All died from stab wounds to the neck.
Mr Kuczynski's death is not being treated as suspicious but the other three are being treated as murder.
The four bodies were discovered by police officers at a house in Allan Bedford Crescent, Queen's Hills, on Friday morning.
It has emerged that Mr Kuczynski was taken to the emergency department at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital by police on 14 December, the same day he was reported as a missing person.
He left the unit after being assessed as having ""mental capacity"", the hospital said.
A spokesperson for the hospital said: ""We can confirm that the patient was taken to the emergency department by police on December 14.
""Following a comprehensive clinical assessment, the patient was assessed as having mental capacity and he left the unit before being reviewed again by the team.""
The fact Bartlomiej Kuczynski was voluntarily taken to A&E because of his mental health in December proves he did have prior contact with health services.
By Nikki Fox, BBC health correspondent, East of England
Police took Bartlomiej Kuczynski to A&E after they sought telephone advice from a mental health team about his behaviour, I understand.
The team told police to get him checked over, so officers took him to A&E and left him there.
He had a clinical assessment - but that does not mean he had a thorough mental health assessment or a follow-up with a mental health professional. We don't know how long he waited in A&E but he left before this was carried out.
Even though he was judged as having capacity, it's not known if concerns were raised by the mental health liaison team at the hospital when he left.
Nor is it known if concerns had previously been raised by Mr Kuczynski's family regarding his state of mind, either to the police or mental health services.
Norfolk Police has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) over the case.
On Tuesday, the IOPC confirmed Mr Kuczynski called 999 shortly before 06:00 GMT from inside the house.
He said he was confused and worried about his mental state.
It is understood he was advised to seek medical advice and contact the NHS on 111.
Police were not despatched until after they received a second 999 call at 07:00 GMT from a member of the public and forced their way into the house

9H807XKT41_1LWOHJD1Q44XDYT,Woman 'ran for her life' from Emma Caldwell murder accused,_,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-68071449,"A woman has told a jury she ""ran for her life"" after being attacked by the man accused of murdering Emma Caldwell.
Iain Packer was alleged to have choked the woman in the back of a van in Glasgow in 2005.
She told a trial at the city's High Court the attack only stopped when a security guard shone a torch into the vehicle.
Mr Packer denies killing Ms Caldwell and a total of 46 charges against 27 other women.
The woman had been working as a sex worker when the incident took place months before Ms Caldwell's body was found in Limefield Woods, South Lanarkshire.
She was aware of Mr Packer from him driving about the city's red-light zone known as ""The Drag"".
She recalled an occasion when she was picked up by him in the city's Broomielaw and headed to a side street next to a nearby casino.
The woman claimed Mr Packer had become ""rough"" and ""tried to strangle [her]"".
She said she was only able to push him off when a security guard appeared at the window of the vehicle and Mr Packer let go.
The woman said she ran back up the Broomielaw and told two police officers about the incident minutes later but they did not do anything beyond threatening to charge her with prostitution.
Mr Packer is accused of indecently assaulting the woman sometime between August 2003 and March 2005.
She did not report the attack to officers until 2019 after she was shown a photograph of Mr Packer by a journalist who was making a television programme about the case.
However, she said she gave three statements to detectives investigating Ms Caldwell's murder in 2005, 2006 and 2007.
Ronnie Renucci, defending, later put to the woman that Mr Packer was not the man who picked her up that night. She insisted it was.
The KC asked at one stage why she had not stopped the person who shone the torch in the van for help.
The woman said: ""I was running for my life. I ran past him.""
The trial later heard from a statement a former sex worker - who has since died  - gave to police after being contacted in 2019 about a ""historic"" incident.
She recalled a man, who she claimed to be Mr Packer, had driven her to woods outside Glasgow and pointed a plastic or toy gun at her.
The woman said he had driven for 40 minutes then another 20 to get into the woods ""while never making any wrong turns"".
Prosecutor Mr Goddard went through the statement with PC Sara Hamilton, one of the officers who met with the woman.
Mr Goddard concluded this was sometime between October 2004 and March 2005 ""before the body of Ms Caldwell was found in remote woods down the M74 in Limefields Woods"".
PC Hamilton replied: ""Yes.""
It is alleged he indecently assaulted the woman and presented the imitation firearm at her.
Mr Packer denies strangling Ms Caldwell in the remote woods near Biggar in 2005 and concealing her body.
The murder charge alleges Mr Packer assaulted Ms Caldwell by restraining her, grabbing her wrists and strangling her with his hands and a cable.
He is then said to have dumped her naked body in the woods as well as disposing of her clothes, phone and other personal belongings.
Mr Packer is alleged to have cleaned a car to ""avoid detection, arrest and prosecution"".

9Q0Q51EUZR_WGS42Q7USI3NJPR,Scott Morrison: Former Australian prime minister to quit politics,By Hannah Ritchie,6 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-68065395,"Australia's former Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced he will quit parliament to join the private sector.
Mr Morrison, a conservative who was first elected in 2007, was the country's leader from 2018 to 2022.
He oversaw Australia's pandemic response, the Aukus defence pact, and was embroiled in a historic scandal for secretly appointing himself to several ministerial positions while PM.
""The time has come for me to return to private life,"" he said on Tuesday.
In a statement Mr Morrison, 55, said he would now take on ""strategic advisory roles"" across Asia to focus on security matters in the Indo-Pacific.
A devout Christian, he said he was ""looking forward to being more active"" in his church and spending time with his family.
Mr Morrison's retirement has long been expected following a shattering election loss to Labor's Anthony Albanese in 2022, which left the Liberal-National coalition with its lowest ever number of seats.
Australia's reputation as a climate laggard was a major factor in his government's demise - with voters favouring candidates committed to more ambitious emissions cuts.
Mr Morrison's initial response to Covid - which included border closures, lockdowns and test and trace protocols - is credited with helping to contain early outbreaks, although a delayed vaccine rollout later drew criticism.
During his time in office, the prime minister had a particularly rocky relationship with China, Australia's largest trading partner.
His government led calls for an international investigation into the origins of Covid, prompting a tit-for-tat trade dispute and a years-long diplomatic freeze.
In a strategic pivot, Mr Morrison instead focused on bolstering regional security alliances, helping to set up the Quad partnership with India, Japan and the US, and signing the Aukus nuclear submarine deal with the UK and US.
But public support for him had begun deteriorating rapidly following his decision to holiday in Hawaii during Australia's deadly 2019-2020 bushfires.
Later, he apologised after being widely criticised for his initial muted response to a string of sexual misconduct allegations which rocked parliament.
After his 2022 election defeat - described by an internal review as the ""most serious"" loss in coalition history - Mr Morrison returned to the opposition backbench.
He became the first former prime minister to be censured by parliament - over secret powers he had given himself during the pandemic.
Mr Morrison said his decision to make himself the joint minister for health, finance, treasury, and home affairs while leader had been in keeping with the ""extraordinary times"" the country was facing.
Ultimately, an investigation found his appointments were legal, and that he used his extra powers only once.
Mr Morrison first garnered national attention in 2013 when he was appointed to cabinet as immigration minister and oversaw Operation Sovereign Borders - which hardened Australia's controversial asylum seeker policies.
He then served as social services minister and treasurer, before succeeding Malcolm Turnbull as Liberal Party leader and prime minister.
Mr Morrison famously defied polls to win the 2019 federal election, having pitched himself to voters as an everyday family man the nation could trust, and adopting the nickname ""ScoMo"".
After a decade of political leadership challenges in both major parties which upended governments, he became the first prime minister to serve a full term since John Howard in 2007.

9QID5459XF_F02YJ4H3R3D50UH,25 Republican governors back Texas in escalating border standoff with US government,By Sam Cabral,3 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68101927,"Republican governors in half of the US have backed Texas in an intensifying standoff with the federal government over illegal immigration.
The Supreme Court ruled this week against Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who has strung razor wire along miles of the frontier with Mexico.
But the Republican has vowed to add more razor wire to crack down on what he calls an invasion.
A record 300,000-plus illegal migrants crossed the border in December alone.
On Thursday, 25 Republican governors released a joint statement of solidarity with Mr Abbott for ""stepping up to protect American citizens from historic levels of illegal immigrants, deadly drugs like fentanyl, and terrorists entering our country"".
The latest border flashpoint focuses on a small stretch of the Rio Grande River that has become one of the busiest spots for migrants crossing illegally from Mexico.
As part of his Operation Lone Star, Mr Abbott has sought to block or deter entry into his state, including by installing about 30 miles (48km) of razor wire barriers along the city of Eagle Pass.

Watch: A look at the US border as immigration debate heats up
On Monday the Supreme Court handed a victory to the administration of President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in its standoff with Texas.
The justices ruled by 5-4 that US Border Patrol, a federal agency, could cut or clear out the concertina wire set up by the Texas National Guard.
The justice department had argued the fencing hampers the work of Border Patrol agents in that it poses a danger to both migrants and law enforcement. Some of the illegal migrants have cut themselves on the wire.
Appearing on Fox News on Thursday, Mr Abbott said: ""Because the Biden administration has really, truly abdicated its responsibility to secure the border and enforce the laws, Texas, very simply, is securing the border.""
He has posted photos of the Texas National Guard laying down new razor wire along the river.
The move does not appear to violate the Supreme Court order, which granted permission for the removal of existing wire, while saying nothing about adding new barriers.
Democrats are urging the president to take a tougher stance against Texas.
""Governor Greg Abbott is using the Texas National Guard to obstruct and create chaos at the border,"" congressman Joaquin Castro wrote on X, calling for federal control over the guardsmen.
Governor Abbott is also facing legal challenges from the Biden White House over his orders to install floating barriers in the Rio Grande and to jail thousands of migrants on trespassing charges.
And, as the governor continues to bus migrants to Democratic cities and states, pressure is mounting on Mr Biden to take drastic action to stem the flow of arrivals.
Last week, Mr Biden said he was ""ready to act"", but argued lawmakers on Capitol Hill must first agree on significant policy reforms.
The prospects of a grand bargain, however, in either chamber of Congress, let alone both, appear slim.
Republicans in the US House of Representatives are currently leading an effort to impeach and remove the president's top border official, Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
An emerging bipartisan border deal in the US Senate meanwhile faces objections from right and left.
Former President Donald Trump, the Republican White House frontrunner, has reportedly pressured allies to kill the bill to avoid giving Mr Biden a win in an election year.
Immigration is a central issue ahead of the November 2024 general election, with voters in Iowa and New Hampshire delivering primary victories to Mr Trump in part due to their concerns over the border.

9S01OF8K92_HG5MPIQP80KV9VO,Kerem Shalom crossing: Israeli protesters hold up aid trucks to Gaza,By Lipika Pelham,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68103641,"Hundreds of Israeli protesters have blocked some humanitarian aid trucks from entering Gaza for a third day.
Demonstrators, including families of hostages still held in Gaza, waved Israeli flags at a key crossing and chanted against ""aiding the enemy"".
The protesters say they are demanding no aid for Gaza until all of the hostages are released.
This comes despite a US demand that aid to civilians in Gaza be allowed to enter ""without interruption"".
For a third consecutive day, the protesters descended on the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and Gaza to try to block humanitarian aid from entering the enclave.
A queue of trucks carrying aid supplies, some of them flying Egyptian flags, idled for hours at the crossing as the protesters urged the government to stop aid supplies until the remaining captives held by Hamas are freed.
The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said that on Wednesday - the first day of the protests - only nine trucks were able to cross at Kerem Shalom, while 114 were diverted to the Rafah crossing in Egypt.
The UN said that only 153 trucks had entered Gaza on Wednesday, which was well below what had been able to enter in recent weeks.
The Israeli government is facing growing international pressure to allow more humanitarian relief into Gaza, combined with intense domestic pressure to secure the release of the hostages.
The protesters say they view the delivery of aid to Gaza while their loved ones are still being held by Hamas as ""a moral failure"".
They say they fear the aid could end up in the group's hands.
Israeli media report that although some of the protesters are related to hostages, others are the parents of IDF soldiers currently deployed in Gaza, with another group representing right-wing activists who promote a return of Jewish settlements to Gaza.
The demonstration took place amid unconfirmed reports that Israeli and American officials will hold ""critical"" hostage talks with Qatari and Egyptian mediators in Europe in the coming days.
The reports suggest that the director of the US Central Intelligence Agency, William Burns, and the Mossad chief, David Barnea, will meet Qatar's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, to discuss the release of more than 100 Israeli hostages and a pause in fighting in Gaza.
The White House has described the talks as ""sober"" and ""serious"" efforts, involving players who were key to sealing a previous agreement in November.
But Hamas continues to insist on a full ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.
A senior Palestinian official has told the BBC that mediators have proposed the phased release of Israeli hostages in exchange for a renewable ceasefire, the release of Palestinian prisoners and an increase in aid.
Meanwhile, heavy fighting has continued in Gaza. Israeli military officials say warplanes have carried out dozens of raids on several Hamas targets around Khan Younis during the night.
The Hamas-run health ministry says Israeli attacks in the past 24 hours have killed 183 people and injured nearly 400 others.
Israel launched its military campaign with the declared aim of destroying Hamas after its gunmen killed 1,300 people - mostly civilians - and took about 250 others hostage, in the unprecedented attack on southern Israeli communities on 7 October last year.
Since then, health officials say more than 26,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza.

Watch: On board flight during mid-air blow out
A major US airline has said it expects to lose money in the three months between January and March due to the grounding of Boeing 737 Max 9 jets.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded 171 of them after an unused door broke away mid-flight.
United Airlines has 79 of the aircraft in its fleet, more than any other carrier, followed by Alaska Airlines.
Both airlines have been forced to cancel hundreds of flights this month as inspections are carried out.
United has said it expects the planes to remain grounded until 26 January and its forecast assumes it won't be able to fly them at all this month.
The issues at Boeing, which is now facing government investigations of its manufacturing process, have also scrambled United's efforts to expand its fleet.
It warned investors on Tuesday that deliveries of dozens of new Boeing planes, including 737 Max 9s and a not yet approved Max 10, will be delayed.
Chief executive Scott Kirby told analysts the firm has not cancelled its orders with Boeing but was considering alternatives.
In an interview with CNBC, he called the latest grounding the ""straw that broke the camel's back"".
Boeing has been struggling to restore confidence since fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving another version of its 737 Max plane that led to a global grounding for more than 18 months. Smaller manufacturing issues have cropped up repeatedly since production restarted.
Stan Deal, head of Boeing's commercial airplanes division, said the firm had ""let down"" its customers and was ""deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers"".
""We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance,"" he said.
The Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon to Ontario, California, had reached 16,000ft (4,876m) when it began its emergency descent, according to flight tracking data, after the unused emergency exit door blew out.
On Sunday, the FAA said another, older 737-900ER model should also be inspected as they use the same door design. United has 136 of these jets in its fleet.
The FAA did not order the older model to be grounded while the visual inspections are carried out by operators.
In the wake of the incident, Boeing said it would increase inspections and bring in an outside expert to review its processes, among other measures.

A8N55BDK1U_FV051JJT1WB9QKQ,Sir Jeffrey Donaldson: DUP leader faces down critics after threats,By Jayne McCormack,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-68074278,"This video can not be played
Sir Jeffrey was speaking as the Commons debated a bill to extend the deadline for restoring devolution
Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said he will not be ""deflected"" after revealing he was threatened over his efforts to reach a deal to restore Stormont.
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader said one of those behind the threats ""didn't even vote at the last election"".
He was speaking as the Commons debated a bill to extend the deadline for restoring devolution to 8 February.
The Stormont executive has not met for 23 months because of a DUP protest.
It has also blocked the functioning of the Northern Ireland Assembly as it seeks changes to post-Brexit trade rules.
""A unionism that turns in on itself is not the way to go,"" he told MPs on Wednesday.
""I was threatened by those who never put on a uniform, by those who haven't served our country and when I checked out one of the people who threatened me, they weren't even on the register.
""They didn't vote at the last election,"" he told the Commons.
""They can't even come out to vote for our future in the union. Yet they're threatening people like me who are working day and night to find solutions.""
BBC News NI asked the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) if anyone had been questioned over the threats made against Sir Jeffrey but a spokesman said the PSNI does not discuss the security of individuals.
The move to legislate for an extension is aimed at giving the DUP more time to decide whether to return to power-sharing.
There have been suggestions that progress has been made between the government and the DUP on the post-Brexit rules, however, there remains no deal.
The Northern Ireland Executive Formation Bill passed through both the House of Commons and the House of Lords on Wednesday, after being fast-tracked.
The government is hoping the bill will receive Royal Assent by the end of the week.
If there is still no executive, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris will be under a legal duty to call an election, but it is understood he may instead put new governance arrangements in place including a greater role for London.
In a lengthy speech, the DUP leader - whose party is facing pressure to return to Stormont - said he would ""continue on course"" and work to reach a decision and that ""further changes"" would come as a result of his party's actions.
He also directed criticism at his unionist rivals in the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV).
""What has the TUV delivered by way of change to the protocol - not a single thing,"" he said.
The TUV leader, Jim Allister, said that his party had ""no apology"" to make for keeping focus on the ""dire constitutional consequences of the union-dismantling protocol"".
He said if the DUP ""backslides into becoming protocol implementers"" his party would ""not hesitate to act"".
""Our mission is to ensure they don't, but if they do, then we will not be deterred from continuing to tell the truth about the iniquitous protocol,"" he added.
Sir Jeffrey told the Commons that others were attempting to ""orchestrate opposition to a deal that has not yet taken place"".
""The fact we're sat here today in the Commons extending legislation reflects the reality that no agreement has yet been reached,"" he continued.
""There are some who, for their own narrow purposes, are putting it about that certain things have been agreed and they know it's there.
""But I say this - wait until an agreement is reached before you make your final verdict.""
Sir Jeffrey added that there was a ""tiny minority"" of people who did not want Stormont back and would prefer ""imperfect direct rule than an imperfect Stormont"".
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said those who threatened Sir Jeffrey ""couldn't lace his boots"".
""We are in a more hopeful place than we have been - if this today symbolises we are getting closer to a resolution we have to welcome it and give it space.""
Alliance MP Stephen Farry said he found Sir Jeffrey's words in relation to a return of power sharing ""encouraging"".
And he said if the DUP returns to the executive that will be a ""smoother way"" of releasing money to resolve public pay sector disputes than putting pressure on the government to step in.
Mr Heaton-Harris also thanked Sir Jeffrey for his speech and condemned those who had threatened him.
""The fact he's been threatened for doing what he has been doing is a disgrace,"" he said.
He added that he hoped politicians would soon be back ""celebrating"" the return of power-sharing.
Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Hillary Benn said it appeared talks between the DUP and the government had arrived at a ""moment of decision"".
Earlier, Julian Smith - who served as Northern Ireland secretary from 2019 until 2020 - said devolution was the ""key route"" for making the case for the union.
He added that the DUP ""seem to have negotiated a very good deal on issues around the Windsor Framework"".
The debate comes after a major strike in Northern Ireland last week by tens of thousands of public sector workers about pay rises.
Mr Heaton-Harris said the funding offer to Northern Ireland's parties for a restored executive would allow money to fund this.

AC21DEPI1T_HUBBYERPSB1UL85,Two fell walkers rescued in major Storm Isha operation,By Samantha Jagger,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-68053590,"Two people who walked up a fell were rescued in a major operation during Storm Isha, which has caused flooding, power cuts and disruption in Cumbria.
About 20 mountain rescue volunteers, two RAF teams and the coastguard had to battle ""horrendous"" conditions on Hart Crag, near Ambleside.
Meanwhile homes have been flooded in Shap where gusts of 82 mph (131.97km/h) were recorded.
Electricity North West said about 7,500 homes were without power in the county.
Langdale Ambleside Mountain Rescue Team (LAMRT) said it had received a report of two walkers, one who had suffered a leg injury and could not walk, on Hart Crag at about 15:00 GMT on Sunday.
The rescue involved two mountain rescue teams, who ""forced their way up, fighting the wind, rain and swollen streams"", and help from two RAF teams and a coastguard helicopter.
Lake District Search and Mountain Rescue Association chairman Richard Warren told BBC Radio Cumbria that a lot of equipment was carried up in anticipation of a serious leg injury.
But he said when teams reached the two people, one of them had ""a twisted ankle, which would have been classed as walking wounded"".
""People will be shocked. The message was very clear, the high fells really was a no-go area,"" he explained.
""I'd be really interested to know what motivated them to go up onto the high fells,"" Mr Warren added.
Meanwhile, power cuts, flooding and widespread travel disruption continue to grip Cumbria in the wake of Storm Isha.
Parts of the M6 near Carlisle and Tebay have been closed and rail services have been cancelled amid weather warnings.
Emergency services in Cumbria were braced for a major incident as Storm Isha, the biggest storm of the season so far, hit the UK.
A yellow warning for wind was issued by the Met Office and remained until 12:00 GMT across Cumbria on Monday, while another yellow wind warning is in place for Tuesday and Wednesday.
Operations at the Sellafield nuclear site have resumed after they were suspended as a precautionary measure.
A number of flood warnings remain in place for Cumbria.
Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service's (CFRS) group manager, Mike Clusker, said the impact had been ""county-wide"".
He said some homes in Shap had been flooded, which was ""mainly due to people driving in surface water"" that caused waves which washed into people's properties.
Owner of Shap Village Store, Cheryl Benson, said the ""worst part"" of the storm had been the effect of people driving through the village, which caused a ""tidal wave into people's houses"".
Mr Clusker said specialist water teams had to rescue four people from two vehicles who had got stuck in Patton Bridge, near Kendal, on Sunday evening.
He said there was ""a lot of standing water"" around in the county and urged people to avoid driving in it.
A small number of homes in Appleby have been flooded as the River Eden's water level rose overnight.
A flood siren warned residents, who were putting sandbags outside their homes up until the early hours of Monday.
Mike Farrell, from the Environment Agency (EA), said officers would remain in the town to help affected residents and ""reduce the impact of any flooding"".
Mr Farrell said the EA was also monitoring the River Eden where levels have ""risen slightly"" on Monday morning.
About 7,500 homes in Cumbria remain without power as engineers have been unable to safely make repairs, Electricity North West (ENW) said.
ENW said ""progress has been made despite horrendous overnight conditions"".
More than 41,000 homes were without power after Storm Isha hit, with the majority of the damage in the north of the Lake District.
Rachael Parr, director at ENW, said the high winds ""continue to make it a difficult situation"" to fix faults.
Ms Parr estimated supplies would be restored by Tuesday at 17:00 GMT, but said this was a ""worst-case scenario"".
The company advised affected customers to check for updates on social media or to call 105 for help.
Rail services at Carlisle have been cancelled with all lines blocked due to heavy flooding.
Operator Northern has urged people not to travel on the Skipton to Carlisle and Barrow in Furness to Carlisle routes.
Rail services running between Hexham and Carlisle have also been cancelled due to a fallen tree blocking lines.
Cumberland Council said its highways team received more than 100 calls overnight.
All lanes were closed on the M6 northbound between J43 and J44 near Carlisle due to an overturned lorry, while the M6 remains closed southbound between J39 at Shap and J38 at Tebay to allow for recovery of multiple overturned lorries.
The A66 remains closed in both directions to all vehicles between Brough and Bowes. Several overturned lorries need to be recovered before the road can be reopened.

AC8L67NPWD_X5HOW41K8TGV4OR,Kate Winslet donates to 11-year-old girl's visual bucket list,By Samantha Noble & PA Media,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-68066756,"Actress Kate Winslet has donated thousands for an 11-year-old's visual bucket list of places she would like to see before losing her sight.
Lily-Rae, from Nottingham, was diagnosed with a rare genetic condition called Stargardt disease in December.
Her mother, Emma, set up a fundraising page to make her daughter's ""dreams come true"" and a Â£5,000 donation with a personal message was left by Winslet.
Lily-Rae said: ""We were shocked. We were both in tears.""
On GoFundMe, the Titanic star wrote: ""Wishing Lily-Rae some magical adventures so she can make many special memories to treasure! With lots of Love, Kate Winslet and family.""
Winslet's donation is double the fundraising page's target of Â£2,500.
The youngster says she dreams of seeing the Northern Lights, Paris from the top of the Eiffel Tower, and would like to go on safari in Africa.
Stargardt disease is an inherited eye condition, which affects one in 10,000 people according to the Macular Society, and causes blurriness in the central part of the eye.
Doctors have told the schoolgirl, who is learning Braille, that her sight is constantly deteriorating, but it is hoped she will keep some of her peripheral vision.
Emma, 45, added the personal message from Winslet was ""so special"".
She said: ""We're very overwhelmed. The donations we've had have been absolutely appreciated.
""To have somebody such as Kate Winslet... I cannot explain how much I respect that woman as an actress, let alone now as an individual as a human being, to be so generous.
""She sent a lovely message as well. To have made so personal was just so special.""
Lily-Rae started losing her eyesight when she was about five years old, but was initially told she just needed glasses by opticians.
Emma said she noticed her daughter was having more sight problems when she picked her up from school, with Lily-Rae only realising her mum was there when she was directly in front of her.
Lily-Rae says her condition does not affect colour, but she does struggle with depth perception.
She can only see from three metres or less, adding she uses a font size 64 to read her laptop.
She said: ""This [fundraiser] is important for us because then I can see the world before my vision goes and my mum can also experience with me and I can just have mental memories and also muscle memories of all the different experiences.""

In a joint statement, Unite, GMB and Siptu announced the first of these will be on 1 February.
The unions are taking action in a dispute about pay.
Bus and train services have been halted during other strike days in recent months including on 18 January when 16 trade unions across the public sector went on strike.
This followed four days of action by Translink staff in December.
The trade unions have called for the Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris to release funds to allow Stormont departments to pass on pay awards.
Mr Heaton-Harris has said he has no legal power to release the money himself as it is a devolved matter.
He has promised parties a Â£3.3bn financial package, including provision for public sector pay, if the Northern Ireland Executive is restored.
It has not met for 23 months as part of the Democratic Unionist Party's protest against post-Brexit trade rules.
On Tuesday, Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said ""in the absence of any movement on pay, public transport workers have been left with no alternative but to escalate their strike action with further strikes"".
GMB regional organiser Peter Macklin said the secretary of state's ""behaviour to date to workers, our public services and indeed the public has been nothing short of disgraceful"".
SIPTU regional organiser Niall McNally said the three unions were ""seeking to coordinate our action with that of the wider trade union movement to keep the maximum pressure on Chris Heaton-Harris so that we can win for workers and our public services"".

AMKZLE02SL_1KZJ399C25IEL0T,Trade deals: What has the UK done since Brexit?,By Tom Edgington,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47213842,"The UK has formally suspended trade talks with Canada despite nearly two years of negotiations, in a row over agricultural products including beef.
Following Brexit and the departure from the EU's trading system in 2021, the UK has been trying to strike trade deals with countries around the world.
This is the first time the UK has formally suspended talks with a potential trading partner since then.
It means tariffs - or taxes - may have to be paid on some UK exports to Canada such as cheese, of which the UK exported Â£18.7m worth in 2022, according to the Food and Drink Federation.
The ability to strike free trade deals was cited by Brexit supporters as one of the benefits of leaving the EU.
A free trade deal aims to encourage trade between countries by making it cheaper and simpler. It normally applies to the exchange of goods, but occasionally to services as well.
Making trade cheaper is usually achieved by reducing or eliminating tariffs. These are government taxes or charges for trading goods across borders and can help protect a country's manufacturers from cheap imports.
A car importer might have to pay a 20% tariff on top of the vehicle's price, for example, to bring it into a country.
Trade can also be made simpler if countries have the same rules, such as the colour of wires in plugs or food safety requirements. The closer the rules are, the less likely that goods need to be inspected.
Since Brexit, the UK has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with about 70 countries and one with the EU.
However, the majority of these are simply ""rollovers"" - meaning they copied the terms of deals the UK previously had when it was an EU member, rather than creating new trading arrangements.
And some of them are with countries with which the UK does very little trade.
A deal with Japan was signed in October 2020. It was the first that differed from the existing EU trade deal.
The Australia deal was the first trade agreement negotiated from scratch by the UK since it left the EU. UK farmers warned they could be undercut by cheap imports, which could cost jobs. However, the UK government insists the deal contains protections for the sector.
An agreement with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein was announced in June 2021 and builds on the previous agreement the UK had with these countries.
The UK signed a new deal with New Zealand on 28 February 2022.
New Zealand is a small trading partner, accounting for less than 0.2% of total UK trade.
While the deal is unlikely to boost the UK economy by much, it could lead to more New Zealand lamb being sold in the UK.
The UK has also agreed to join an existing trade agreement between 11 Pacific Rim nations. The government expects to become a member of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in the second half of 2024.
Talks with India began in early 2022, although no deal has been reached.
And there has not been a deal agreed with the US, although it had been set as a priority in the Conservative 2019 manifesto.
Rishi Sunak said in June 2023 that a full free trade agreement had not in fact been a priority for either country ""for a while now"", although a more limited economic agreement called the Atlantic Declaration was signed.
After Brexit happened on 31 January 2020, the UK and EU needed to decide the rules for their future trading relationship.
This was important because the EU was the UK's largest and closest trading partner.
After months of negotiation - which went down to the wire - a UK-EU trade deal came into force on 1 January 2021.
The deal prevented any tariffs and quotas being introduced, which would have made it more expensive to trade goods between the two partners.
But not everything is the same as it was before Brexit.
As the UK no longer has to follow EU rules on product standards, new checks have been introduced.
The deal also does not completely eliminate the possibility of tariffs in future. Both sides will need to stay close to shared rules in areas such as workers' rights and environmental protection. If either the UK or the EU shift their rules too far, the other side could introduce tariffs.

AMUKDDYGYM_V87RNDYNT5F3UY3,Baby Elsa: Abandoned newborn leaves hospital with foster parents,By Sanchia Berg,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-68099394,"A newborn baby found in east London has been discharged from hospital and is in foster care, a court has heard.
Baby Elsa was discovered by a dog walker last Thursday, wrapped in a towel inside a bag in Newham in sub-zero temperatures.
East London Family Court heard Elsa's parents had not come forward and there was no information about her identity.
Judge Carol Atkinson issued an interim care order for the baby, requested by Newham Borough Council.
Police are still appealing to Elsa's mother to come forward and urge her to get in touch by phone, or walk into a hospital or police station.
Court documents suggest the baby was very cold when she was found - it was three hours before doctors could record her temperature.
However, she was crying and responsive the whole time and, later that night, staff reported she was feeding well and named her.
The documents show Elsa was born approximately an hour before she was abandoned and still had her umbilical cord.
Doctors believe she was a full-term baby and weighed 6lbs 6oz (2.9kg) when she was found, the documents say.
Elsa is now medically fit and, on Tuesday, was discharged to foster parents who had been visiting her in hospital.
The interim care order will give the local authority parental responsibility for Elsa while further information is gathered about her identity and, in future hearings, the court will decide where her permanent home will be.
During the hearing on Thursday, Elsa's court-appointed guardian asked to change her name.
She said it appeared to be a reference to the baby being found during the very cold spell, as Elsa was the main character in the Frozen series of Disney films.
The guardian's barrister explained the reasoning behind the request, telling the court her name could have an impact on her when older as it might be seen as ""gimmicky"".
However, Judge Carol Atkinson disagreed and said the court needed to consider the position of a child who had lost everything, adding the name they were given when found could be ""something they can hang on to"".
Very few babies are recorded as abandoned at birth in England and Wales.
The Office of National Statistics (ONS) published data until 2015, and that showed no babies were registered as abandoned for the previous three years, with just one logged as abandoned in 2011.
There will be a second hearing at East London Family Court in a few weeks' time.
Family Courts usually hold hearings in private, but the BBC was given permission to report under a transparency order issued by the judge.
This is part of a wider initiative allowing journalists to report family court hearings - which from 29 January will apply to almost half the Family Courts in England and Wales.

ANEHKECAJ2_31N3JLIVOS2DT3S,China reveals British national sentenced to jail in 2022 for spying,By Yvette Tan,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-68078586,"A British national was sentenced to five years in jail for spying in 2022, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Mofa) has now revealed.
The defendant - named as Ian J Stones - committed the ""crime of illegally obtaining intelligence for overseas actors"", a Mofa spokesman said.
The spokesman added that he had appealed against the sentencing but the case was upheld last September.
This was only revealed in a Mofa briefing on Friday.
According to an article by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Stones worked in China for four decades with big US firms like General Motors and Pfizer and is believed to be aged around 70.
He set up a Beijing-based investment management consulting firm some 15 years ago, said the WSJ, citing corporate records, online profiles and people who know him.
Mofa spokesman Wang Wenbin said the court had ""tried the case strictly in accordance with the law"", adding that Beijing had ""fully guaranteed the various legitimate rights"" and arranged for British officials to visit him and attend his trial.
Stones' daughter told the WSJ that embassy officials and one family member were permitted to witness one hearing but not the actual trial,  adding that none of them had been permitted to see any of the legal documents related to the case.
She also claimed her father was healthy at the beginning of his detention but had received ""inconsistent medical care and poor nutrition leading to severe and life-threatening injuries"".
Ms Stones said British Embassy staff have been able to visit Stones every four to six weeks to check on him, but that there have been long periods where they received no news and were not permitted any consular visits.
In a statement, Mr Wang added that Stones was accused of ""being bribed into providing intelligence by external forces"" .
""The judicial organs strictly promote the handling of cases in accordance with the law, safeguarding the rights and legitimate interests of both Chinese nationals and foreigners,"" he said.
This latest reveal comes as China increasingly publicises cases of alleged espionage by Western countries.
Beijing has also launched public campaigns to raise awareness of foreign spying and has been calling on people to report any suspicious activity.
Earlier this month, Chinese authorities said they had detained an individual alleged to be spying for Britain's foreign intelligence service, MI6. The BBC was not able to independently verify these claims.
The UK government has a policy of neither confirming nor denying claims relating to intelligence issues.

ANFNJY2OUN_G7V48HR7ZQBBZBM,Six dead after plane carrying Rio Tinto workers to diamond mine crashes in Canada,By Nadine Yousif,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68075721,"Six people have died after a plane carrying workers to a Rio Tinto diamond mine in Canada's Northwest Territories crashed, officials said.
The small Jetstream aircraft was on its way to the company's Diavik mine and crashed shortly after take-off.
One survivor was airlifted to a hospital in Yellowknife, the Northwest Territories coroner's office said.
Rio Tinto said it is working closely with authorities as they investigate the crash.
""We are absolutely devastated by this news,"" Rio Tinto's CEO Jakob Stausholm said in a statement.
Four of the fatalities were passengers, and two others were crew members with Northwestern Air, the Northwest Territories coroner's office said in a statement on Wednesday.
The plane crashed near Fort Smith, a small town about 740 kilometres south of Yellowknife, north of the Alberta border.
Canada's public broadcaster CBC reported that the plane crashed about 500 metres from the end of the Fort Smith Regional Airport's runway. Joint Rescue Coordination Center Trenton said it lost contact with the plane shortly after take-off.
Rio Tinto's Diavik Diamond Mine is about 300 kilometres northeast of Yellowknife. According to the company's website, it has been in operation since 2003.
The incident has been ""very devastating"" for the close-knit community, said Fort Smith's deputy mayor Dianna Korol.
""Everybody has a little piece â or somebody that they know,"" Ms Korol told the CBC.
RJ Simpson, the premier of the Northwest Territories, offered his condolences to the victims' families and friends.
""The impact of this incident is felt across the territory,"" Mr Simpson said.
""The people we lost were not just passengers on a flight; they were neighbours, colleagues, friends and loved ones. Their stories and contributions to our communities will not be forgotten.""
Both the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Transportation Safety Board of Canada are investigating the crash."
AO54BX8ZEE_LWBBJAN7UEIP816,Grenfell Testimony Week: Father tells of stillborn son's lost life,_,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-68058939,"The father of a baby who was stillborn after the Grenfell Tower fire has described the life his son could have had to the companies that many survivors and bereaved families blame.
Marcio Gomes spoke of the family taken from him and his son Logan.
He described his family's excitement at the new arrival and detailed the experiences - such as hearing the baby's first cry - he will not have.
He said: ""This is what you have taken away from me"".
Grenfell Testimony Week forms part of an agreement signed in 2023 following the settlement of a damages claim involving about 900 cases and a global sum of about Â£150m in compensation.
The fire, in the 23-storey North Kensington tower block in the early hours of 14 June 2017, killed 72 people and was one of the UK's worst modern disasters.
Organisers said the testimony week is being held to give the bereaved, survivors and residents an opportunity to ""speak directly to representatives from the defendant organisations that many of them hold responsible for the fire"".
Opening the testimonies, Mr Gomes, at times tearful and pausing to compose himself, told the firms his son, his ""prince"", would by now have celebrated his sixth birthday.
Mr Gomes and his wife Andreia Perestrelo lived with their two daughters in the tower for 10 years. All four narrowly escaped the blaze, but Logan did not.
Looking directly at representatives from companies associated with the tower, as well as the council and government, who sat silently to his right, he said: ""This is what Logan's life would've been. This is what our lives would've been.""
A film of excerpts of the inquiry into the disaster was also played, in which various people, including former government minister Lord Eric Pickles were heard saying they ""could not recall"" when asked questions during the inquiry.
One clip of Lord Pickles, who was secretary of state at the Department for Communities and Local Government between 2010 and 2015, captured him noting how much of his time the inquiry was taking up.
Other testimonies included that of Emma O'Connor, who lived on the 20th floor of the tower and managed to escape with her partner on the night of the fire. Ms O'Connor, who is disabled, said: ""I still struggle every day with survivor's guilt.""
An actor read a statement by Behailu Kebede, in whose flat the fire began.
Mr Kebede has been cleared of any blame by the inquiry into the disaster, but in his statement he told of the ""deep shame"" that remained with him and the pain he felt about what happened.
He spoke of the ""special place"" Grenfell had been for him before the fire, but described how he felt he had to ""hide away"" after what happened because of media attention, and how the ongoing sense of trauma kept him from attending testimony week.
He said those responsible had failed to admit any fault in the immediate aftermath, leading to ""division and confusion"" among victims about where blame lay.Before the testimonies, the names of all those who died in the fire were read aloud, followed by a 72-second silence - one for each.
Representatives from Celotex, Exova, London Fire Brigade, Kingspan, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Rydon, and Whirlpool are all present at testimony week, alongside representatives from the Home Office and Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.
Arconic, which supplied the cladding on the outside of the tower, said it had made a ""significant"" financial contribution to fund the event but sent no representatives.
In closing submissions to phase two of long-running inquiry into the disaster in November 2022, lead counsel Richard Millett KC accused several firms of a ""merry-go-round of buck-passing"" in order to protect their own interests.
The resulting phase two Grenfell Inquiry report has not yet been published.

AO914W0LUB_XXHFROGCTD3V90U,Cost of living: Swansea mum says hub helps keep baby warm,By Meleri Williams,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-68069665,"A mum-of-five has said a public warm hub helps her keep her baby warm amid soaring energy bills.
Kaylee Maunder, from Swansea, also described the Port Tennant hub as an important place for meeting friends.
The hubs were set up and funded by the Welsh government and councils last winter in response to the rising cost of living.
One think tank said it was worried about their growing popularity.
The Bevan Foundation said people should be able to afford to heat their own homes and not have to rely on warm hubs.
The Welsh government said it would do all it could to support people through the cost of living crisis.
The warm hub in Port Tennant is one of more than 80 centres across Swansea which had funding grants from the city council.
""[Bills] are so high, it makes me worry,"" said 35-year-old Kaylee.
""I've got a newborn so my heating's obviously got to be on, which makes this place very important.
""I know of many people who go without food so that their children can have things, so coming here might be the one meal they get.""
Linsey Collins, 41 added: ""You can come here and be warm - you haven't got to worry about putting your heating on in the house.""
In Pontarddulais, volunteers in the Bont Elim Community Church hub serve warm drinks and food for parents and toddlers.
Charlotte Bidwell-Williams, 32, said it was invaluable for her and her 14-month-old daughter.
""It's donations only, but there's lots of food and healthy options too,"" she said.
""It's just great to have a support system too and meet other mothers.""
Councillor Alyson Anthony said the council's warm spaces scheme had gone from ""strength to strength"".
""It's also about bringing the community together, so I think they'll continue because that's what people want,"" she added.
The social benefits to warm hubs, of which there are about 700 across Wales, have been highlighted in recent research by Swansea University.
Researcher Ella Rabaiotti said hubs continuing throughout the summer when there was not the need to stay warm ""was the surprising benefit - that it was more about the emotional warmth"".
But the Bevan Foundation has reservations, despite welcoming the support out there for people.
Dr Steffan Evans added: ""Our priority really should be enabling people to be warm in their own homes.
""If we see the value of having these social spaces then we should be investing in them because of their social value, rather than a poverty-alleviating method.""
The Welsh government said: ""We continue to do all we can to support people through the cost of living crisis to alleviate financial pressures and maximise incomes.
""This includes the Welsh Benefits Charter, which aims to remove the barriers facing people claiming their benefit entitlements.
""There's also our Warm Homes programme which provides energy efficiency measures for vulnerable households living in the least energy efficient homes.""

APF6Y97P1R_616NZ3PHEACDGQA,New Hampshire primary: Donald Trump and Nikki Haley to go head-to-head,By Francesca Gillett,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68064703,"This video can not be played
Watch: Whatâs at stake for Trump and Haley in New Hampshire?
Donald Trump is facing his last remaining Republican opponent, Nikki Haley, in a primary election in New Hampshire on Tuesday.
The former US president is hoping to deliver a knockout blow to the ex-South Carolina governor's campaign to be the Republican nominee.
Ms Haley hopes New Hampshire's bloc of independent voters will help her pull off an upset victory.
The contest follows Mr Trump's landslide win last week in Iowa.
The eventual Republican nominee will challenge the Democrat nominee, likely President Joe Biden, in November's general election.
A contest between Mr Biden, 81, and Mr Trump, 77, would be a re-run of the 2020 presidential vote.
Democrats are also voting in their primary in New Hampshire on Tuesday, but because of a dispute between national and local party officials, Mr Biden is the first sitting president not to appear on the ballot.
The race for the Republican nomination narrowed to just two on Sunday, after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis came a distant second in Iowa's caucuses and then quit and endorsed Mr Trump.
Mr Trump already held a double-digit lead in many opinion polls taken in New Hampshire before Mr DeSantis' exit. Most surveys suggest a majority of the Florida governor's supporters view Mr Trump as the next best option.

Watch: Voters cast their ballots in New Hampshire primary
A new poll released by Suffolk University and the Boston Globe on Tuesday morning showed Mr Trump 19 points ahead of Ms Haley, 57% to 38%. A second poll from Monmouth University and the Washington Post showed him with an 18 point lead, 52% to 34%.
At a rally in Laconia, New Hampshire, on Monday night Mr Trump said that his campaign has ""to win by big margins"" to ""send a signal that we're not playing games. This country has gone to hell.""
""If you want a losing candidate who puts America last, vote for Nikki Haley,"" he added.
He told the crowd that ""globalists and radical left communists"" were convincing liberals to vote for her in the Republican primary.
""They want to run against her because she's so easy to beat,"" he added.
Most voters in New Hampshire will cast their ballots during the day on Tuesday but in tiny Dixville Notch, a handful of people voted at midnight in a decades-old tradition. All six registered voters in the resort town chose Nikki Haley over Donald Trump.
At a campaign event earlier in the day, Ms Haley, 52, said Mr Trump was preoccupied with the criminal and civil cases he faces. He denies all charges, claiming political persecution.
""When you hear Trump speak,"" she said, ""what's he talking about? Grievances, the past. He's talking about vendettas.
Ms Haley, who was UN ambassador under President Trump, added: ""When you go out on Tuesday, you're going to decide: do you want more of the same, or do you want something new?""
Speaking at a separate event in Salem on Monday night, Ms Haley urged voters to support her, arguing that polls show she has a better chance in a general election against President Biden.
""We have a country to save and we have the opportunity to save her,"" she said.
Anyone in New Hampshire can vote in the primary, and the state is seen as more moderate than deeply conservative Iowa. Mr Trump won the Republican nomination in the state in 2016 and 2020.
The Haley campaign is pinning its hopes for a potential shock win on the 40% of voters in New Hampshire who are registered independent.
The Democratic New Hampshire primary, which is also held on Tuesday, is at the centre of a dispute between state party officials and the national Democratic National Committee.
New Hampshire is usually the first primary in the US election calendar, but the national DNC changed the order to make South Carolina first, arguing that it better reflected the country's diversity.
Local party officials in New Hampshire decided to run the primary anyway, so the DNC said it would not award any delegates, effectively not recognising the results, and Mr Biden would not be on the ballot.
Instead, some of Mr Biden's Democratic allies in New Hampshire are urging voters to write his name on the ballot when they vote.
Polls in the state will begin closing at 1900 EST (0000 GMT), with the last closing an hour later. Preliminary results are expected around this time, although the final tally may take several more hours.

ARDRGTRD94_D4IO7M60RQE6ATF,Can the Met Police's new approach restore trust?,Sonja Jessup,24 January 2024,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c84nl2jzxw3o,"Local police officers in Finsbury Park are being supported by specialist colleagues to target crime and anti-social behaviour
""Nine times out of 10, they've always got some sort of weapon on them,"" PC Taylor Clarke tells me.
It's a Wednesday evening in Finsbury Park and she's just heard over the police radio that her colleagues have arrested a suspect on a bus, who is carrying a phone that's been reported stolen, as well as a lock knife.
""They don't even have to use the knife or weapon,"" PC Clarke says. ""They can just say, 'I've got something on me,' or gesture in their pocket they've got something on them, and that's enough to put the fear into someone to give their phone over.""
Tonight's operation is part of a new Met approach called Clear, Hold, Build, which is being rolled out in high crime areas in London.
Police arrested eight suspects in an operation in Finsbury Park targeting drug offences and robbery
It involves three phases: Clear, where police arrest suspects and remove them from the area; followed by Hold and Build, where officers work long term alongside other local agencies and community groups to ensure trouble doesn't return.
Finsbury Park is currently in the first phase, which kicked off in December and involves more than 70 officers targeting business premises on Blackstock Road.
""The concerns we're hearing from our community is around violence against women and girls, intimidation by groups congregating in the area, alongside drug dealing, drug supply and also violence,"" says Supt Jack May-Robinson.
He says they're using information supplied by local people, and that police teams include both officers from the area and their specialist colleagues, who have experience in tackling organised crime.
Mehmet Bezgin, manager of the BlackStock pub, says his customers used to repeatedly complain about being victims of crime, but says the police presence has ""almost stopped"" the problems over the last month.
""Nobody is feeling safe on the street. Just when you are walking, someone is nicking your mobile phone. Lots of ladies were not feeling safe walking down this road,"" he says.
He adds one challenge has been knowing who to complain to, because the area borders three different councils - Haringey, Hackney and Islington.
Mehmet Bezgin, manager of the Blackstock pub, says the police operation has '""almost stopped"" offences over the last month
Another business owner will only speak to me anonymously because he says he is scared for his life.
""It's been a nightmare,"" he tells me. ""It's all about drug dealing, it's about robbery, it's about harassment. It's been going on for years and years.
""We've had meetings with the mosque, the police, the council. Finally, it feels like the hope is coming back.""
He's very relieved to see the police, but says there needs to be a long term presence. ""It's like cat and mouse. If they're not there, the crime will come back.""
Supt Jack May-Robinson believes the Clear, Hold, Build strategy is an opportunity to build trust and confidence
By the end of the evening, the police have made eight arrests, on suspicion of offences including knife point robbery, drug supply and money laundering.
The initiative started as a Home Office pilot in other areas of the UK, but is now being adopted by the Met, with the first scheme starting in Barnet on the Grahame Park estate over last summer.
The Met was placed in a form of special measures in June 2022, and is under pressure to improve neighbourhood policing and listen to the concerns of Londoners, following a damning review by Baroness Casey, external last March.
Supt May-Robinson says Clear, Hold, Build is an important part of the Met's reform plans, external to restore relationships in the community.
""The concerns around trust and confidence in the police is something, as a neighbourhood superintendent, I really need to reflect upon, and this initiative is giving us the opportunity to build that trust and confidence, and show the activity that we're taking against their concerns,""  he explains.
A presentation about the new scheme was held at St Thomas the Apostle church hall in Finsbury Park
Five days on from the arrests on Blackstock Road, about a hundred local residents gather in a church hall in Finsbury Park to listen to a presentation about the scheme.
""It's very hopeful,"" Jeanette Hunter tells me. ""If they listen to the residents who live in the area then it will be very successful.""
Chris Mozo, who runs a mentoring organisation supporting young people, agrees, but says he wants to see lasting change. ""It looks really good on paper, but will it work? A lot of these things have come up before.""
Local resident Dorothy Newton believes it's ""a wonderful initiative"".
""It's great it's working across boroughs, because that's what we need, but we've just got to hold it to account somehow.""
""You deal with something, but you've got to follow it up,"" she adds.

AS9VPAHSLZ_1KH189TE5U4SR69,Johannesburg's Usindiso fire survivors living in unsafe shacks in South Africa,By Daniel De Simone,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68085956,"The man was thought to be a witness, not a suspect.
But when he appeared this week at the public inquiry into South Africa's deadliest building fire, he announced he had started it.
Sthembiso Lawrence Mdlalose, 30, said he had started the fire in the Usindiso building last August unintentionally.
He described himself as working for a violent drug dealer who demanded rent from residents.
He said the fire began after he used fuel to set light to the body of a man he had strangled while high on drugs, in a ground-floor room used to beat people targeted by the dealer.
Police arrested him at the inquiry. While in custody, he made a further confession.
He appeared in court on Thursday charged with 76 murders, 86 attempted murders, and a charge of arson. The authorities have not explained why he is facing 76 charges of murder, when the public inquiry has said 77 people died in the fire.
Prosecutors allege the murders were pre-meditated.
Johannesburg, known as the city of gold, is Africa's wealthiest city.
The fire has highlighted the profound housing crisis here.
Many people live in appalling conditions, without water or electricity, in deeply unsafe buildings.
The plight of the fire's survivors demonstrates the crisis still further.
More than 500 people were left homeless by the fire. The residents are some of the poorest people in South African society.
In the immediate aftermath, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the scene and declared ""our hearts go out to every person affected by this event"".
He said the disaster called on everyone, from the government down, to help restore the wellbeing of those affected and ""offer all material help residents may need"".
But, five months on, many survivors are suffering.
We visited 39 families who have been placed by the authorities in a newly built camp of metal shacks, which have no water or power, and which flood when it rains.
Sthembiso Ndebele lives in one of the shacks with her three children, including her disabled 10-year-old son, who she said is not coping with the conditions.
She asked President Ramaphosa to ""please give us housing not these shacks - these shacks are too dangerous for us"".
Hundreds of people living in the shacks have access to only two communal taps, a few chemical toilets which residents say are deeply unhygienic, and no showers or bathing facilities.
We saw men cooking on open fires, with elderly women shovelling sand around the bottom of their shacks to stop water getting in.
The Denver area of the city where the shacks have been placed is dangerous, and one girl has been raped, the residents said.
At first, multiple security guards were provided to keep watch, but these were withdrawn, leaving a single guard on a daytime shift by the time we visited.
Andy Chinnah, a human rights activist who is helping the residents, said: ""We want dignity and this is not dignity"".
When I challenged Johannesburg's Mayor, Kabelo Gwamanda, on the camp's conditions, he said there was not ""sufficient budget for us to be responding efficiently or in the manner in which we want to"", especially when ""unplanned"" emergencies occur.
He said that, in the past, the city had decent alternative accommodation, but those properties ""got hijacked"".
This was a reference to the city's so-called ""hijacked buildings"".
Matthew Wilhelm-Solomon, author of The Blinded City, says the term emerged in the early 2000s and referred to criminal gangs taking over some properties.
He says it was subsequently applied by the media and politicians to an array of buildings, even though many did not have gangs taking over and illegally renting them.
Wilhelm-Solomon says that what was essentially a crisis about affordable inner city rental properties began to be viewed ""through the lens of criminality"", which ended up criminalising people who were just looking for accommodation.
Many buildings in the city have been abandoned or neglected by owners and left without basic services or safety measures.
The law gives people evicted from such buildings the right to emergency temporary accommodation. But the profound lack of affordable housing means this is rarely offered.
The camp of metal shacks is the authorities' current offer of such temporary accommodation, but those living there wonder how long ""temporary"" will turn out to be.
An estimated 15,000 people are believed to be homeless in Johannesburg.
The mayor says there are now 188 ""bad buildings"" under investigation, with 134 of them in the inner city, and that the city authorities are pursuing multiple court cases to evict people, approaching them as places from which they need to be rescued.
Courtrooms are a battle ground in the struggle for decent housing.
After the Usindiso building fire, there were 248 people at the scene who agreed to be relocated to various shelters, according to court documents, with some foreign nationals refusing to be relocated to shelters due to fear of deportation.
Thirty-two foreign nationals were arrested and placed in a repatriation centre, but human rights groups went to the high court and obtained an order preventing the state from deporting them for now as they are witnesses in the ongoing public inquiry.
At one stage, the Department of Home Affairs claimed the main support groups for the fire's victims did not exist and that residents should have brought a court case in their individual names, but the court rejected the government's arguments.
In the meantime, the danger remains in Johannesburg's ""bad buildings"".
One property that has been a focus of attention is Vannin Court, long without water or power, and which is falling into deep disrepair.
The broken lift shaft is dangerously open, with children walking past in the darkness, and the fire escape lacks stairs as thieves have stolen them for scrap metal.
Some residents have been living in the property for decades and say they feel abandoned.
Vannin Court has been subjected to high-profile police raids, with politicians and media in tow, and five years ago the local authorities received publicity after claiming the property would be totally redeveloped - a pledge that was never followed through.
Mukelwa Mdunge, who lives in Vannin Court with her family, told us that facilities in the building once worked but had fallen into tragic dereliction, with the darkness and a lack of security creating constant danger for residents.
But she says the residents have no other option, and do not want to be evicted into even more uncertain conditions.
""This one is our home, where can we go?""
At the inquiry into the fire, where the confession came this week, damning evidence is now being heard about an entire culture of safety and security for the poorest in society.
Last week, fire safety expert Wynand Engelbrecht said the condition of the Usindiso building was not unlike that of hundreds other similar buildings in South Africa.
""It is clear both privately-owned and public sector-owned structures are far too often left to deteriorate to the point of no-return.
""Life safety is not a priority in this country, not even by a long shot.""
The current reckoning is barely beginning, let alone near an end.
The suffering behind Johannesburg's neglected walls will not be contained.

AZE7Q0RMZ2_CGUAEVATXTRZF3V,Lamb Stormzy born at height of Storm Isha is 'a fighter',By Beth Pritchard and Kevin Shoesmith,3 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-68097413,"A lamb born as Storm Isha raged has been named Stormzy by keepers at a Lincolnshire wildlife park.
Jamie and Michelle Mintram, who run ARK Wildlife & Dinosaur Park at Stickney, said staff found the rare Soay lamb cold, alone and close to death in a field.
The couple decided to name the stoic creature after the UK rapper - and as a nod to Sunday's Storm Isha.
Mr Mintram said: ""He is a little fighter.""
According to Mr Mintram's research, there are only about 900 breeding female Soay left.
Primarily a sanctuary for crocodiles, wildcats and racoons, the park took in Stormzy's mother a few months ago when the field she grazed in flooded.
Mr Mintram admitted the new arrival, which is now being cared for in their home, took everyone by surprise.
He said: ""Storm Isha had hit the previous night so the keepers were doing early morning checks, making sure everyone was OK.
""One of the keepers saw this little bundle in the middle of the field. At first, she thought it was a rabbit. When she got closer, she realised it was a baby lamb.""
Mr Mintram, who was told of the arrival via a radio message, said he asked the keeper for confirmation.
He said: ""I was like, 'are you sure?' She [the mother] is so fluffy you wouldn't be able to tell she was pregnant. We also didn't know that she had been with male sheep in her previous home.""
Mr Mintram said Stormzy had been out in the open all night.
""The poor little guy was born at the height of Isha,"" he said.
Unfortunately, the high winds are thought to have spooked Stormzy's mother, causing her to abandon him.
Mr Mintram said: ""When we found him, he was rather a poorly little thing.""
Keepers considered his chances of survival were poor.
""He wasn't moving,"" explained Mr Mintram. ""He felt cold. We thought the inevitable was going to happen.""
Desperate to increase his survival chances, staff tried to encourage Stormzy's mother to accept him, but Mr Mintram said she was ""not interested"". Stormzy also failed to engage with his mother, forcing the team to intervene.
Mr Mintram said his wife had spent the past few days bottle-feeding formula milk to Stormzy every two hours.
""We managed to get food into him,"" he said. ""It was only a few grams to start with but as each feed went on he seemed to get more and more strength.""
Mr Mintram said he was now considering introducing a ""companion lamb"" for Stormzy, explaining it would be a while before he can mix with mature sheep ""because they might bully him"".

B08AYQZRPO_9DUUW3VUBXZL28R,New sculpture celebrates Alan Turing at the University of Cambridge,By Danny Fullbrook,7 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-68037758,"A sculpture to commemorate the wartime codebreaker Alan Turing has been unveiled at the University of Cambridge's King's College.
The work, by Sir Antony Gormley, best known for The Angel of the North, stands at 12.1ft (3.7m) tall.
Sir Antony said the sculpture was not a ""memorialisation of a death, but about a celebration of the opportunities that a life allowed"".
The creation can be seen between Gibbs Building and Webb's Court.
1912 â 1954
1912 Alan Mathison Turing was born in West London
1936  Produced âOn Computable Numbersâ, aged 24
1952 Convicted of gross indecency for his relationship with a man
2013 Received royal pardon for the conviction
Turing, the Bletchley Park codebreaker, played a crucial part in the Allies' victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two.
He studied at King's College from 1931 to 1934 and was elected a fellow there in 1935.
The sculpture was made from 5.5in (140 mm) thick rolled Corten steel, a material used often by Sir Antony in other works.
He said: ""Corten contains 1% of copper which means it will oxidise over time, forming a rich red rust surface. The sculpture's relationship with time and weather is an integral part of its character.""
Gillian Tett, provost of King's College, praised the artwork for reflecting both ""Turing's brilliance and his vulnerability"".
""At the same time the sculpture also embodies the transformation of the industrial in to the information age,"" she said.
In August 2022, Historic England told Cambridge City Council's planning committee that the sculpture would be ""far more visible"" than the proposals implied and could cause ""some harm"" to the significance of the historic college.
However it was and approved and the college thanked the council for supporting the project as it would ""give food for thought and pleasure to countless generations to come"".
The sculpture's location meant it would be visible daily to staff and students but the college said it would make the work accessible to visitors and school groups through pre-arranged bookings.
Sir Antony said: ""I want this work to be something that the life of the college lives with and that will be a continual source of questioning, of projection, a marker of an elusive relationship to a person and our evolving time.""

B0VCE8P8A3_OJYA2VF15AD08H4,Stop the boats policy a 'fake response' to migration issues - UN,_,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68090320,"A top UN official has voiced concerns over the UK government's ""stop the boats"" policy, which he says is a ""fake response"" to migration issues.
Rishi Sunak's promise was one of his government's five priorities that the PM set out at the start of last year.
But Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees, told the BBC migrants were ""easy targets"".
The Home Office said the issue of illegal migration required ""bold, innovative solutions"".
Ahead of a US presidential election and a general election in the UK, both within a year, Mr Grandi admitted there is pressure from electorates over immigration issues in the respective countries.
""But that is largely induced by politicians who are fuelling it,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
""Manipulating it often through a whole set of fake news to gain votes.""
""Migrants, refugees are easy targets. It is much less sexy and attractive to say 'we need to roll up our sleeves and work on these issues' rather than saying 'let's push them back and that will solve all our problems' - which it won't.""
Mr Grandi was asked by Today presenter Nick Robinson if he is referring to the UK's ""stop the boats"" policy and Donald Trump's ""build a wall"" policy.
""Exactly,"" Mr Grandi answered.
""Those are fake responses which don't address even the problem of arrivals.
""The risk is there is only attention on that at the expense of the real difficult work which needs to be carried out to better manage these complex thoughts.""
Speaking from Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, Mr Grandi also expressed his concerns over the UK government's Rwanda asylum scheme.
Currently going through Parliament, the proposed five-year agreement would see some asylum seekers arriving in the UK being sent to Rwanda to have their claims processed there.
Under the plans, if successful, they could be granted refugee status and allowed to stay in the central African nation. If not, they could apply to settle in Rwanda on other grounds or seek asylum in another ""safe third country"".
But, in November 2023, the UK Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the Rwanda scheme was unlawful.
After the Supreme Court ruling, the government introduced a new bill to make clear in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country.
Mr Grandi told the BBC that some countries with ""more resources"" are devising ""systems with which they would abdicate responsibilities they have to asylum seekers and shift these responsibilities to other states. This is contrary to the basic principles of refugee protection"".
""It is important all people seeking asylum have access to fair procedures, especially countries which are signatories to conventions,"" Mr Grandi said.
""If that responsibility is renounced, is given away, because you want to keep people away from your borders, then this will always meet our [the UN's] disapproval.""
Mr Grandi called for ongoing Western support for Ukrainian's affected by the war and described a ""moving"" trip of a school in Kyiv which has been built underground to protect children from air strikes, describing it as a symbol of how ""abnormal"" life has become for millions in the country.
He continued: ""I have been in many wars, but hardly ever have I seen such strength among the civilian population - and yet, I want to warn everybody, we shouldn't take that for granted. That strength needs international support.
""Four billion dollars is the amount of money requested as a whole to sustain the humanitarian response to the entire Ukrainian crisis, inside Ukraine and in countries hosting refugees.""
Commenting on a blast at a UN facility in southern Gaza which killed 12 people, Mr Grandi said he was ""very worried about this systematic destruction of not only civilian infrastructure in general but in this case of the Khan Younis training centre, of infrastructure which is under the UN flag"".
Israel said it did not carry out the strike, and is investigating whether it was hit by Hamas fire.
Commenting on government asylum policy, a Home Office spokesperson said: ""The UK is not abdicating its responsibilities as has been alluded to by the UNHCR - this is a partnership with a safe country that cares deeply about refugees, and currently hosts over 130,000 asylum seekers.
""Both the Court of Appeal and the High Court found that the principle of relocating individuals to safe third countries to have their asylum claims processed is consistent with the UK's obligations under the Refugee Convention. The Supreme Court did not disturb this.""
Last week, the Home Office said it is committed to preventing small boats crossing the English Channel from France.
""Our priority is to stop the boats, which is why we have taken robust action to crack down on vile people-smuggling gangs, deter migrants from making dangerous crossings and, alongside our French counterparts, intercept vessels,"" a spokesperson said.

B562ZB44V4_DFG59LL105X51ZF,Ukraine death toll rises to 18 after Russian missile attacks,By Sarah Rainsford in Kyiv & Paul Kirby,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68066309,"This video can not be played
Watch: Man pulled from rubble of home in Kharkiv
Eighteen people were killed and 130 injured in Russian missile attacks on Ukrainian cities on Tuesday morning, President Volodymyr Zelensky says.
He said 139 houses were damaged, and the death toll could rise as more people may be trapped under the rubble.
Officials in Ukraine's second biggest city of Kharkiv in the north-east, earlier said eight people were killed, including an eight-year-old girl.
In Pavlohrad, central Dnipropetrovsk region, one woman was killed.
In the capital Kyiv, 22 people were injured, and a number of cars set on fire, local officials said earlier.
""Ordinary life is what modern Russia considers a threat to itself. This state is a typical terrorist,"" President Zelensky said in his video address on Tuesday night.
Kharkiv was particularly badly hit in the morning attacks, with Mayor Ihor Terekhov saying that part of a block of flats was destroyed and rescue workers were searching the rubble for survivors.
The sky over the city turned burnt orange with fire after the strikes, which used multiple kinds of Russian missiles. The city is very close to the Russian border - it's difficult to intercept the missiles in the air.
Kharkiv resident Natalia told the BBC she doesn't remember things being this ""loud"" since the start of the war: ""My house shook. It was all very loud. There were explosions, then another ten seconds - and another bang.""
""Many people are without power and heating. Other than fear and hatred, at this moment I feel nothing,"" she said.
On Tuesday evening, another seven people were injured in a new Russian missile attack, Mr Terekhov said.
In Kyiv, the air raid went on for more than two-and-a-half hours in the morning, the longest since 2 January. Several other people were hurt when a block of flats caught fire and another was damaged.
A spokesman said a young woman was pulled from the rubble. Initially rescuers thought she had died, but she is now in hospital in intensive care. Most of the casualties were in Kyiv's central Solomianskyi and western Sviatoshynskyi districts.
In Sviatoshynskyi district, several residential buildings were damaged. Hours after the attacks, emergency services told the BBC they were still on the scene and looking for explosives as it was suspected there may be part of a missile that did not detonate.
Three other regions of Kyiv were also damaged by falling debris after air defences intercepted the Russian missiles during the attack. The office of mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said 13 people - including three children - were being treated in hospital.
Elsewhere in the city, when the attack was over, city residents emerged from their bomb shelters and homes to check the damage.
In areas lucky enough not to be hit this time, people went about their morning as usual. Shops opened up, and roads and streets were busy.
At a hospital the BBC visited, staff kept working through the air raid, even though they heard the explosions and felt the doors rattle.
But at the site of the missile attack on Tuesday afternoon, emergency workers were picking through the debris where large fragments fell on a block of flats.
All the flats at one end of the building were blackened by fire, some of the balconies badly smashed. There were piles of furniture and belongings in the snow in the street.
Behind the police cordon, local residents, including curious children, were also examining the damage.
Tetyana, who had come from a few streets away, said her family had spent the early morning air raid in the bathroom of their flat - hoping they would be safer, further from any windows.
""At the start of the war we thought we would get used to this, but you never do,"" she told the BBC. ""It's scary every single time."" A few months ago, their own building was damaged by shrapnel when a drone was shot down over the city.
Ukraine's military said it had destroyed 22 of 44 ballistic and cruise missiles launched by Russia overnight.
Missile strikes on Ukraine's cities are now a deadly reality of this war and attacks have intensified in recent weeks.
Reflecting Ukrainian concerns that its demands for weapons are not being met by Western allies, the head of the presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, published a video of the damage in Kharkiv and said: ""Kharkiv. We are not just a 'fortress'. We need weapons!""
Ukrainian forces have in the past week targeted Russian energy infrastructure, including unprecedented attacks on an oil terminal in its second city St Petersburg.
Energy company Novatek has had to halt some of its operations after a fire at its Ust-Luga Baltic Sea export complex."
B69D5FGJO3_DGJB3J4JE5N0B0O,"Gary Baird: Daughter of murder accused says father 'gentle, kind'",By Kevin Sharkey,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-68108812,"The daughter of a man accused of murdering his wife has described her father as very gentle and kind.
Gary Baird, 64, denies the murder of Susan Baird, 60, at their home in the Four Winds area of Belfast in August 2020.
He had pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter, but this plea was not accepted by the prosecution.
On Friday, the couple's daughter, Janice Dunseith, gave evidence before a jury of seven women and five men.
Ms Dunseith, 38, who is a nurse and the couple's eldest daughter, described her mother as ""kind, caring, a best friend, and a devoted Christian"".
When a defence barrister asked her about her father - a former security guard - she said he was ""very gentle, again very kind"".
She said their family was ""close, very close, a normal family"".
During her testimony on Friday, Ms Dunseith paused and took a moment to compose herself when she was shown a photograph of her father and mother together on holiday in Portrush, a month before her mother was killed.
The photograph of the couple smiling was sent by Susan Baird with a caption saying: ""Holidays excited.""
Ms Dunseith told the jury that she first noticed her father struggling with mental health issues in 2015 after his mother died.
She said she had raised concerns with medical professionals after he collided with a lorry 10 days before her mother was killed.
She explained that her father was concerned about their mother's care while he was in hospital being treated for his injuries.
Asked if her father acknowledged his mental health struggles, she replied: ""He knew that.""
Ms Dunseith also told the jury that she, her two sisters and brother are in regular contact with their father.
Susan Baird worked as an administrator at Orangefield Presbyterian Church in east Belfast.
She died after suffering multiple injuries, including fractures to her skull, lacerations on her brain and forehead, and bruising on various parts of her body.
Her injuries were so bad that she had to be identified from her dental records.
Earlier this week, the jury was told that the defendant said he had ""a tiff"" with his wife on the day of the killing. He further explained that he had a hammer because he had been doing DIY work in the house that day.
He then claimed that ""voices"" in his head had told him: ""This is your time. This is your opportunity.""
The trial has also previously heard that the couple had been experiencing marriage difficulties for a number of years.
Three years before her death, Susan Baird sent a solicitor's letter to her husband stating that she was planning to begin divorce proceedings.
They subsequently took part in counselling and stayed together in the family home in Windermere Road, south Belfast.
The jury has also been shown CCTV footage of Gary Baird being hit by a bin lorry on a road in the centre of Belfast 10 days before he attacked his wife.
Following the death of his wife, Gary Baird was detained in Belfast City Hospital's acute mental health unit for more than a year.
The jury has heard that the issue of diminished responsibility will be raised during the trial."
B82MNOZ6NH_76W0E0BDW8GH7CZ,US demands Israel conduct full investigation into Palestinian-American teen's killing,By Nadine Yousif,6 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68038149,"The US is calling for a full probe into the murder of a Palestinian-American teenager who died on Friday in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Tawfic Abdel Jabbar, 17, was shot in the head and killed, his family said.
Jabbar's family said they believe he was hit by an off-duty Israeli soldier and an Israeli settler who shot at the car he had been driving.
The Israeli police said a civilian and an off-duty policeman had fired at someone suspected of hurling rocks.
The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said that one of its members was also in the area, and that it is investigating the claim that the soldier had fired shots at the Palestinian teenager.
The White House, increasingly at odds with the Israeli government and also facing criticism at home about its handling of the war in Gaza, is pressing for a wide and deep investigation.
Calling the death of Jabber ""a tragic killing"", National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby said that ""we have every expectation that those responsible will be held accountable"".
""We call on Israel to conduct a full, thorough and transparent investigation into his killing,"" Mr Kirby said at a White House press briefing on Monday.
Jabbar's death comes amid rising tensions in the West Bank between Palestinians and Israeli settlers, as the war between Israel and the militant group Hamas in Gaza enters its fourth month.
At least 319 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the war broke out on 7 October, according to UN data. Many were killed in shootouts with the Israeli military, but some, witnesses say, were killed by Israeli forces and settlers while they were unarmed.
President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are divided over the future of post-war Gaza. Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected US calls for a two-state solution to the conflict, where a Palestinian state would be created next to an Israeli one.
Born and raised in Louisiana, Jabbar had travelled to the village of Al-Mara'a Al-Sharqiya, about 10 miles northwest of Ramallah, with his family in May to learn about his Palestinian roots, his family said.
His father, Hafeth Abdel Jabbar, told NBC News that his son had hoped to study engineering in college and was considering pursuing a degree in the West Bank.
Jabbar's family said he was killed after going out for a picnic with friends. Witnesses told them that the teenager was first shot by a person who appeared to be a settler, followed by someone wearing an IDF uniform.
In his interview with NBC, Mr Abdel Jabbar said  he doubts the US government will take action to respond to the killing of his, who, he said, was ""very loved"".
He dismissed the accusation by Israeli authorities that his son was hurling rocks. But he added that even if rocks were thrown, his son should not have been killed.
""You're gonna shoot the car 10 times because a guy threw a rock?"" he asked.

BDF4RQ4MAX_XA3IPK145JQDE05,Emma Caldwell murder trial told accused took woman to body site,_,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-68107704,"A sex worker had a panic attack while directing police to the woods where Emma Caldwell's body was found, a murder trial has been told.
A jury heard that the woman told police that Iain Packer - who is accused of killing Ms Caldwell - drove her more than once to the area south of Glasgow.
She described him as ""Jekyll and Hyde"" character after he got angry when she refused to strip naked.
Mr Packer denies killing Ms Caldwell and 46 charges against 27 other women.
He is alleged to have murdered Ms Caldwell, a 27-year-old sex worker, at Limefield Woods in Biggar, South Lanarkshire in April 2005
Retired detective constable Stuart Hall told the High Court in Glasgow that he and a colleague met with another sex worker in February 2006 who took them to the same woods.
Mr Hall said they collected the woman and her partner in Glasgow headed onto the M8 and then the M74.
They stayed on the motorway for up to an hour before ending up at the the junction for Happendon Services in South Lanarkshire.
Prosecutor Richard Goddard KC asked Mr Hall what her reaction was at that point.
He said: ""She took what she described as a panic attack. She was crying and became hysterical, hyperventilating.
""We could see she was visibly distressed.""
When the journey resumed the woman continued to direct and point out landmarks along the way.
They travelled 41 miles from Glasgow ending up ""down quite remote countryside"".
Mr Hall told the court the woman seemed ""terrified"" when they got to the area where she said Mr Packer had taken her.
The advocate depute then asked: ""This was the same place the body of Emma Caldwell - also from Glasgow - had been found?""
Mr Hall replied: ""Yes.""
The court heard the woman gave a statement to police about being in the area with the man she identified as Mr Packer, although she had known him as ""Peter"" at the time.
She said he had ""usually treated her like a lady"", but had got angry when she refused to take all her clothes off outside.
The woman said she was ""really frightened"" and feared her would beat her up and then leave her there.
The man later dropped her back in Glasgow having repeatedly apologised enroute for her being ""scared"".
She told officers: ""I would describe him as Jekyll and Hyde â¦ like a spoilt child who would get upset if he did not get his own way.""
Mr Packer, 51, faces a total of 46 charge against multiple women, three men and a teenage boy, between 1990 and 2016.
He denies strangling Ms Caldwell in Limefield Woods near Biggar in 2005 and concealing her body.
The murder charge alleges he assaulted Ms Caldwell by restraining her, grabbing her wrists and strangling her with his hands and a cable.
He is then said to have dumped her naked body in the woods as well as disposing of her clothes, phone and other personal belongings.
He is also alleged to have cleaned a car to ""avoid detection, arrest and prosecution"".
The trial, before judge Lord Beckett, continues.

Kaylin Gillis was shot in the neck by Kevin Monahan, 66, on 15 April 2023.
Monahan's lawyers had argued the fatal shot was fired accidentally by a defective shotgun after he tripped on a nail on his porch and dropped it.
He was found guilty of second-degree murder, reckless endangerment and tampering with physical evidence.
Monahan could face life in prison when he is sentenced on 1 March.
The jury in Washington County, New York, took less than two hours to reach its decision on Tuesday.
Friends and family members of Ms Gillis cried and hugged in court as the verdict was delivered.

Watch: Witness speaks out about Kaylin Gillis driveway shooting
Ms Gillis was in one of a group of three vehicles that drove down Monahan's long, curving driveway on a Saturday night in the small town of Hebron, about 55 miles (88km) north-east of Albany.
The friends were in an area without mobile phone service and trying to find a party at a different address.
They had realised their mistake and were already turning back when Monahan emerged and fired twice from his 20-gauge shotgun.
He testified last week that he felt his life was threatened and that he fired a warning shot from his weapon.
But he said the second shot, which killed Ms Gillis as she rode in the passenger seat of an SUV driven by her boyfriend, was a misfire that came after he dropped the gun on his porch.
""I didn't mean to shoot the second shot,"" Monahan testified according to the Greenwich Time newspaper. ""The gun went off.""
During closing arguments on Tuesday, Assistant District Attorney Christian Morris told jurors that Monahan had ""acted out of anger"".
""He grabbed his shotgun and intended to make them leave as fast as possible and he didn't care if they were hurt or killed.""
Local police had previously said that he had ""not shown any remorse"" for the killing.
The victim's family said in a previous statement that she had been looking forward to starting college in Florida so she could become a marine biologist.
In a separate case that took place just days after Ms Gillis' death, a householder in the US state of Missouri was charged with shooting 16-year-old Ralph Yarl, who rang the wrong doorbell while picking up his younger brothers.

BFQP033RHF_8UJ7WCIOU82OG1L,Rampton: Call for action after death of patient who swallowed crayon,By Tom Oakley & Greig Watson,6 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-68051388,"A coroner has called for improvements at a high-security psychiatric hospital in Nottinghamshire after the death of a patient who swallowed a plastic crayon.
Tammy Watkins died in June 2021 after the crayon she ingested at Rampton Hospital perforated her bowel.
An inquest in October found neglect at the hospital contributed to her death.
A coroner has now called on hospital bosses to take action to prevent future deaths.
Ms Watkins, 36, had been assessed as being at high risk of ingesting foreign objects for self-harm and mechanical restraints, such as mittens, were in use.
But staff gave her a twistable crayon to use while her mittens were removed, which had not been risk assessed or approved for use, on 22 March 2021.
The crayon was noted as ""missing"" but no incident report was completed nor was a plan initiated to find it.
Ms Watkins presented with ""symptoms of a complication of swallowing the item"", including vomiting, the following day.
The coroner's prevention of future deaths report, published on Friday, says her symptoms were raised with the physical healthcare team and she said that she could ""feel the twistable crayon inside her"".
However, she was not taken to hospital until 17 May 2021 after she told staff she had swallowed a toothbrush.
Ms Watkins had an x-ray at Bassetlaw District General Hospital but it did not reveal any foreign bodies.
Her symptoms worsened on 4 June 2021 but opportunities to seek medical attention for her were missed, said the coroner.
She died after suffering a cardiac arrest two days later.
Following the inquest, Ms Watkins' family said they felt ""let down"" by hospital staff.
""It seems there were a lot of mistakes made by everyone at Rampton Hospital and a lot of warning signs that she needed proper hospital care,"" they said.
Solicitor Jenny Fraser, who represented the family, added: ""We hope that this investigation highlights to all establishments who have the responsibility of looking after those in need, to sit up and pay attention to ensure that they have the fundamental safeguarding and systems in place.
""Preventable deaths need to stop happening.""
Coroner Laurinda Bower said Ms Watkins' death ""demonstrates a further example of a failure by medical staff to recognise a deteriorating patient"".
She said this - and other deaths of ill patients in the care of the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust - was ""exceptionally worrying"" and called for action ""to be taken at the most senior level to effect meaningful change to the quality of physical healthcare across all secure settings at which the trust provides services"".
The trust has accepted multiple failings in the patient's care ""probably more than minimally contributed to her death"", the report added.
Ifti Majid, chief executive of Nottinghamshire Healthcare, said: ""On behalf of the trust, I would like to say how deeply sorry we are to Tammy's friends and family and once again extend our sincere condolences for their loss.
""We acknowledge that there were aspects of care which were not of the quality they should have been.
""We are considering the findings of the jury and any wider concerns the coroner may have, and will address these so that the experience for patients now and in the future is continually improved.""
The report comes after Rampton Hospital was rated ""inadequate"" by the Care Quality Commission following an inspection in June and July.
The trust will have 56 days to come up with an action plan after receiving the coroner's report.

BGFXH9T7WM_2ZKG1O2MC9C0EPX,Cameroon starts world-first malaria mass vaccine rollout,By Paul Njie & Natasha Booty,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-68037008,"The world's first routine vaccine programme against malaria has started in Cameroon, in a move projected to save thousands of children's lives across Africa.
The symbolic first jab was given to a baby girl named Daniella at a health facility near YaoundÃ© on Monday.
Every year 600,000 people die of malaria in Africa, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
Children under five make up at least 80% of those deaths.
Cameroon is offering the RTS,S vaccine free of charge to all infants up to the age of six months old.
Patients require a total of four doses. Health officials say these will be given at the same time as other routine childhood vaccines to make it easier for parents.
It comes after successful pilot campaigns in Kenya, Ghana and Malawi - where the vaccine caused a 13% drop in deaths of children of eligible age, says Unicef.
The jab is known to be effective in at least 36% of cases, according to US researchers, meaning it could save over one in three lives.
While the rollout is undoubtedly a relief and a life-saver, its relatively low efficacy rate means that it is not a ""silver bullet"", argues Willis Akhwale at End Malaria Council Kenya.
But for medics it is an important additional tool in the fight against malaria alongside mosquito nets and malaria tablets. Using all three together potentially gives children 90% protection from malaria, one UK-led study estimates.
""We have a capacity to considerably reduce the number of cases and deaths from malaria and accelerate the elimination of the disease,"" Cameroonian doctor Shalom Ndoula, who helped to lead the vaccine rollout in his country, told BBC Newsday.
Development of the RTS,S vaccine has taken 30 years of research by the British drug-maker GSK.
The World Health Organization, which approved the vaccine, hailed the launch in Cameroon as a historic moment in the global fight against the mosquito-borne disease.
There was another breakthrough earlier this month, when Cape Verde became the first sub-Saharan African country in 50 years to be officially declared malaria-free by the global health body.
Fears and doubts among some Cameroonians about the safety and efficacy of the doses have raised concerns about vaccine hesitancy.
""When people say we are being used as guinea pigs, that's not particularly true,"" Wilfred Fon Mbacham, who is a Cameroonian king and also a professor of public health biotechnology specialising in malaria, told BBC Newsday.
""We as scientists have to do much more to educate the public on what it is, and the benefits it has, so that we can calm their fears.""
Vaccination official Daniele Ekoto at Monday's launch told the BBC she was reassuring mothers after administering doses to their children, insisting that ""it's a vaccine that's safe, effective and free"".
But for others the benefits are obvious.
""I decided to vaccinate my child to avoid malaria. It's a bad thing and when it affects a child, they can easily die,"" one mother told the BBC at the same vaccination centre in Soa, near YaoundÃ©, where Monday's launch happened.
In 2021, Africa accounted for 95% of malaria cases globally and about 96% of related deaths.
""I have prayed and waited all my life for this vaccine"", Mr Mbacham told the BBC.
The WHO says Cameroon records about six million malaria cases every year, with 4,000 deaths in health facilities - most of them children below five.
Six-month-old children in 42 districts with the greatest rates of morbidity and mortality will receive four doses until the age of two.
Twenty other countries aim to roll out the programme this year, according to the global vaccine alliance, Gavi. Among them are Burkina Faso, Liberia, Niger and Sierra Leone.
There is already a big demand for doses, but only about 18 million are available for allocation before 2025, according to Gavi.
It falls short of what is needed by the countries the vaccine alliance has recommended for approval.
The anticipated rollout of a second jab - R21 - developed by Oxford University, is expected to significantly increase the number of doses available for use.
This is to be manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, which aims to make 100 million doses per year, so long as it successfully passes the regulatory approvals following its recommendation for use by the WHO last year.

BGHXQB6EYM_AXXZ7XXBCPX2574,Theresa May horrified by type 1 diabetes disordered eating,_,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-68057324,"Theresa May was ""horrified"" to discover the serious health risks for those with both an eating disorder and type 1 diabetes.
This can lead some to restrict their insulin intake for fear of putting on weight, which can be fatal.
Lady May, diagnosed with type 1 in 2013, told Radio 4's Today programme better NHS support was needed.
She chaired a parliamentary inquiry into the life-threatening consequences of disordered eating with type 1.
The inquiry heard from Lesley and Neal Davison, whose daughter Megan killed herself aged 27.
Megan had an eating disorder and was not taking the insulin she needed to stay alive, known as type 1 disordered eating (T1DE).
Lady May told BBC News: ""When I first heard about it... the idea that a young woman could actively not take her insulin because of concern about body image - because it can lead to putting on weight - I was horrified by that.
""But you can understand why young people might get into that position.""
Type 1 diabetes means the body's immune system mistakenly attacks cells within the pancreas, which then stop producing the hormone insulin, blood-glucose levels rise and the insulin has to be replaced through daily injections.
About 400,000 people in the UK have type 1 - and T1DE could be affecting up to 40% of the females and 15% of the males, research suggests.
They often restrict the amount of insulin they take, to control their weight, which can lead to unstable blood-sugar levels, malnutrition and a raised risk of depression and anxiety.
Better awareness of the condition, more mental-health support and a joined-up approach by the NHS are all needed so that healthcare professionals are aware of the ""conflicting pressures"" on people with type 1 and an eating disorder, Lady May said.
NHS England is running eight pilot schemes combining diabetes and eating-disorder support into one service.
People using them have been shown to recover more quickly from T1DE, with fewer admissions to hospital, but there are question marks over their future funding.
Type 1 diabetes charity JDRF UK chief executive Karen Addington said T1DE was ""both devastating and widespread"".
""It can be a frightening and lonely experience, isolating people from their loved ones,"" she said.
""If you're experiencing symptoms, you're not alone.
""Please reach out to your GP and diabetes specialist - they're there to guide you.""
Lady May also reflected on her own experiences with type 1 diabetes, after being diagnosed in her 50s.
""There are good days and bad days,"" she told Today.
Over time, she has learned to think ""very carefully"" about her blood-sugar levels - mainly affected by food intake and exercise - and how to control it with daily insulin injections.
Lady May said type 1 diabetes should not stop anyone from doing anything - even from becoming prime minster, as she was between 2016 and 2019.
She confessed that Jelly Babies had been her ""go-to"" when she had felt her blood sugar dropping during meetings.
And at other times, she felt her blood sugar spiking, often before Prime Minister's Questions because of the build-up of adrenaline.
Lady May said she'd been inspired by Great Britain rower and Olympic gold medallist Sir Steve Redgrave, who was diagnosed during his sporting career. He had said: ""Diabetes had to learn to live with me, rather than me with it.""
She also hailed new artificial-pancreas technology which means thousands more people will be able to manage their condition far more easily on the NHS.
The system uses a glucose sensor under the skin to automatically calculate how much insulin is delivered via a pump.

Kandice Barber, 38, of Wendover, Buckinghamshire, was sentenced to six years and two months in prison.
The Secretary of State for Education has now prohibited her from her profession on a recommendation from the Teaching Regulation Agency. (TRA)
The panel concluded she had a ""callous and selfish disregard for her pupil's well-being"".
The report said ""public confidence in the profession would be seriously weakened if conduct, such as that found against Ms Barber, were not treated with the utmost seriousness when regulating the conduct of the profession"".
Barber did not attend the hearing or call any witnesses.
In her response to the notice of proceedings, she called the hearing a ""waste of time"".
She wrote: ""Unfortunately due to the conviction and sentence I will be on the Sex Offenders reg indefinately [sic] therefore will never be able to work in education and nor would I want to!""
She also claimed she was not, and never had been, a teacher and said her role in the school was just as a cover supervisor.
The TRA investigated those claims and found evidence Barber had been engaged in teaching work which was ""on occasion significant"".
The panel found her ""conduct was so egregious and harmful as to be fundamentally incompatible with her being allowed to teach in future"".
In January 2021, Aylesbury Crown Court heard Barber added herself to the victim's Snapchat account in September 2018.
Messages with the boy, who cannot be named, became sexualised within a week.
She later asked the victim to meet her, going to a private field before having sex with him.
Barber later told the teenager to delete all messages and block her on Snapchat in a bid to stop evidence being found.
In a statement from the victim he said the stress and anxiety of the legal case had caused ""poorer-than-expected GCSE results"".
Barber was found guilty of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.
She was found not guilty of two further counts of the same offence.
Barber was also handed a 16-month sentence for causing a child under 16 to watch sexual activity by a person in breach of trust and a further 10-month sentence for sexual communication, to be served concurrently with her main sentence.

Lindsay O'Neill and her siblings have been awarded Â£250,000 in damages for the suffering endured by their late father.
John McGuinness was a resident at Nazareth Lodge from the age of five to seven.
His daughter said he had finally received justice.
""He's believed,"" Ms O'Neill told BBC News NI. ""That is the best thing that's come out of this.""

'My father endured unimaginable abuse at children's home'
Mr McGuinness took legal action against the Sisters of Nazareth, the religious order that ran Nazareth Lodge on Ravenhill Road in south Belfast.
He died from a heart attack in 2020 at the age of 59 - before the case could reach its conclusion.
Last week, awarding damages, a High Court judge said Mr McGuinness's life had been ""blighted"" by the treatment he suffered at the children's home.
Mr McGuinness said a number of nuns assaulted him and alleged a handyman who worked at the home subjected him to regular sexual assaults in the toilets.
When contacted by BBC News NI, the Sisters of Nazareth said it had no comment.
Ms O'Neill, who took on her father's case after his death, said he was ""told if you tell anybody anything, bad things are going to happen to your mum"".
""The whole depravity of it all. Thinking that he was going to be kept safe. And it was actually nuns that did it. It's just awful.""
She said her father ""struggled a lot"" in life.
""I think when I got older and understood it, I realised my daddy's got problems because of what happened to him.
""Trying to get over it, daily. On a good day he was great. But we didn't get a chance to get a good day every day because of what he went through and experienced.""
Mrs O'Neill added: ""If that hadn't have happened to my daddy, he would have had a completely different life. We all would have. And they've robbed him of that.""
During the legal proceedings, the defendants argued that the form of alleged corporal punishment used when Mr McGuinness was a resident had been ""appropriate and commensurate to the accepted educational practices"".
Solicitor Claire McKeegan, who represented Mr McGuinness, told BBC News NI: ""His case was accepted by the court - he was believed in full, which was something that was so important to him the whole way along.
""He wanted to get justice, he wanted to get accountability and he wanted, like so many other survivors of historical institutional abuse, to be believed and vindicated.""
She said that while the Â£250,000 in damages awarded to Mr McGuinness' family may seem high, ""the sad thing is that it is recognition of the pain and suffering that John endured and carried throughout his life"".
""So it is not a windfall for his family. It is justice.""
Mr McGuinness's case is the latest to emerge from abuse carried out at children's homes in Northern Ireland.
The Historical Institutional Abuse (HIA) Inquiry studied allegations of abuse in 22 homes and other residential institutions between 1922 to 1995.
These were facilities run by the state, local authorities, the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland and the children's charity Barnardo's.
The public inquiry, led by the late Sir Anthony Hart, found that there was widespread abuse and mistreatment of young residents across the institutions.

The collision happened at about 21:45 GMT along Broad Road in Limavady, County Londonderry, on Sunday night.
The driver of the other vehicle has been taken to hospital for treatment.
The police have appealed for anyone who may have witnessed the collision or who has dash-cam footage of the incident to come forward.
SDLP Councillor Ashleen Schenning described the death as ""terrible, terrible news"".
""To wake up and realise that, as a result of a tree coming down, someone lost their life is just devastating,"" she added.
""It was cruel. The weather was cruel,"" Councillor Schenning said.
""You can see, even as I was coming here today, there's so many roads closed, so many trees down.""
The DUP's Steven Callaghan, mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Council, said it was ""devastating news"" for the family.
""Sad news for Limavady and it would be shocking waking up this morning to find that some of your loved ones just haven't made it home as a result of the storm,"" he said.

""It started with a noise. The earth started to shake,"" Oumar Sidibe, a local official for gold miners told the AFP news agency.
The tunnel collapsed at a site in the south-western Koulikoro region on Friday but the number of deaths had not been reported until now.
AFP quotes officials as saying that more than 70 people died.
Mr Sidibe said: ""There were over 200 gold miners in the field. The search is over now. We've found 73 bodies.""
Mining ministry spokesperson Baye Coulibaly told Reuters news agency the provisional death toll was more than 40.
Mali's government expressed ""deepest condolences to the grieving families and to the Malian people"".
It also asked communities living near mining sites to adhere to safety requirements and to only work in areas reserved for gold panning.
Mining accidents are common in the country as most unregulated miners use unsafe methods to dig for gold.
Mr Coulibaly said the ministry had strongly advised miners against digging unauthorised tunnels, but that it had been ""in vain"".
The ministry said they would investigate the incident further and send a team to the area on Thursday.
Mali is one of the world's biggest exporters of gold.

BTCHLGGUH6_4H6VD4L5G1GB022,Hayes man who spied on housemate convicted of murder,_,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-68071437,"A man who installed surveillance equipment to spy on his housemate has been convicted of murdering her.
Sheldon Rodrigues killed Stephanie Hansen in Hayes, west London, in December 2022 after she turned down his advances.
Rodrigues had been obsessed with Ms Hansen for at least seven years, even offering to have surgery to change his appearance, the Old Bailey was told.
He attacked her after discovering, via a listening device, she had a partner.
Jurors heard how Rodrigues, 30, spent 158 hours listening to audio he recorded from a kit he had hidden inside a television to monitor her actions and eavesdrop on dates.
He had been working a night shift for a cargo company near Heathrow airport when he discovered her boyfriend had visited her.
Arriving home at about 07:00 GMT, he attacked Ms Hansen in her bedroom.
Nearly 60 separate injuries were recorded on her body, the court heard, including knife wounds to her neck and blunt force injuries caused by a hairdryer and large fan.
Rodrigues, of Willenhall Drive, Hayes, denied murder and claimed he set up recording devices for Ms Hansen's safety.
He also tried to shift suspicion to Ms Hansen's boyfriend.
Rodrigues's long-standing obsession was exposed in messages on his phone dating back to 2015.
In 2021, he wrote: ""It hurts to see you every day knowing you'll never like me,"" to which she responded: ""I do like you but just not enough.""
He appeared not to accept the rejection, offering to change and have surgery to alter his looks, the court was told.
In April 2021, the pair moved into a house in Willenhall Drive to share bills.
Messages between them suggested there had been some intimacy, but Ms Hansen said it was ""a mistake"" and she only wanted to be friends.
By late 2022, Ms Hansen was in a relationship with a colleague which ""angered"" the defendant, the court was told.
He bought a spy camera to make secret recordings inside the house and monitor Ms Hansen's new relationship.
A covert listening device was found in Rodrigues's bedroom and he also paid a man Â£100 to drive him around in a car to follow Ms Hansen's boyfriend.
Ten days before the murder, Rodrigues searched the internet for ""how to make a woman fall in love with me"", the court was told.
After killing Ms Hansen, Rodrigues left her body in the bedroom for about 24 hours before calling 999 and pretending he had just found her.
Judge Judy Khan KC remanded Rodrigues into custody ahead of his sentencing on 8 March.

Two years on and Disney - instead of battling Ibrahim and his colleagues - has announced a collaboration.
It is the first time that it will work with African storytellers to create an animated series set on the continent.
IwÃ¡jÃº will be a long-form series ""steeped in science fiction"" based in a futuristic Lagos, Nigeria, Disney says.
Ibrahim, along with Nigerians Ziki Nelson and Tolu Olowofoyeku, created the company Kugali to tell ""stories inspired by African culture using comic books, art and augmented reality"", according to their website.
""This show will combine Disney's magic and animation expertise with Kugali's fire and storytelling authenticity,"" Nelson said.

Meet the three friends hoping to 'kick Disney's ass'
They work in the Afrofuturism genre, referencing African history and tradition, which in part tries to address the absence of Africans within mainstream science fiction.
""The idea was that in science fiction there were hardly any black people - it was as though they were passing on the message that there are no black people in the future,"" Nelson told the BBC in 2019.
Now, with the Disney collaboration, he says that ""IwÃ¡jÃº [which means ""the future"" in the Yoruba language] represents a personal childhood dream of mine to tell my story and that of my people"".
Though at this stage the creators are not giving anything away about the plot, Disney says the series will explore ""deep themes of class, innocence and challenging the status quo"".
Walt Disney Animation Studios' chief creative officer Jennifer Lee said it was the BBC's short film about Kugali that caught her attention, entertainment website Deadline reports.
She said she was intrigued by Ibrahim's ""ass-kicking"" comment.
""Here were three talented comic book artists. Their dream was to bring African stories created by African artist to the world, highlighting the diversity of cultures, histories and voices across the continent,"" she is quoted as saying.
""Their talents as storytellers blew us away.""
Disney says that not only will this be the first time one of its projects will be set in an Africa ""that is envisioned and told by filmmakers from the region"", but it is also the first collaboration with another creative company ""to bring a project to fruition"".
IwÃ¡jÃº is due to be released on the Disney+ channel in 2022.

C7JVRIIDK1_632N8XEFG38ATOK,Meta tool to block nude images in teens' private messages,By Chris Vallance,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68093343,"Meta has said it will launch a new safety tool to block children from receiving and discourage them from sending nude images, including in encrypted chats later this year.
The tool is likely to be optional and available to adults too on Instagram and Facebook.
It follows criticism from government and police after Meta started to encrypt Messenger chats by default.
They say encryption will make it harder for the firm to detect child abuse.
According to Meta the new feature is solely designed to protect users, particularly women and teenagers - under-13s are not allowed to use its platforms -  from being sent nude images or being pressured into sending them.
It also announced that minors would, by default, be unable to receive messages on Instagram and Messenger from strangers.
Earlier this month, police chiefs said youngsters sending nude images contributed to a rise in sexual offences committed by children in England and Wales.
And legal filings recently made public as part of a US lawsuit against Meta, allege company documents show an estimated 100,000 teenage users of Facebook and Instagram are sexually harassed online every day. Meta has accused the lawsuit of mischaracterising its work.
But on Thursday the tech-giant revealed a planned new feature to help protect teenagers from inappropriate images in their messages.
This system will also work in encrypted chats with more details to be revealed later this year.
Meta's recent decision to protect Facebook Messenger chats by default with end-to-end encryption (e2ee) has been fiercely criticised by government, police and leading children's charities.
E2ee means only sender and recipient can read messages meaning, critics say, Meta cannot spot and report child abuse material in messages.
Other messaging apps such as Apple's iMessage, Signal and Meta-owned already WhatsApp use the tech and have strongly defended the technology.
However, some critics say platforms should deploy a technique called client-side scanning to detect child abuse being sent via encrypted apps.
Client-side scanning refers to systems on a user's device that scan messages for matches with known child abuse images before they are encrypted and sent, and report any that contain suspected illegal content to the company.
Children's charity the NSPCC has suggested Meta's new system ""shows that compromises that balance the safety and privacy rights of users in end-to-end encrypted environments are possible"".
According to Meta its new feature is not client-side scanning, which it believes undermines the chief privacy protecting feature of encryption, that only the sender and recipient know about the contents of messages.
It will use machine learning only to identify nudity and will work entirely on device, the BBC understands.  According to Meta, using machine learning to identify child abuse is much harder and there would be a serious risk of errors if this was attempted across its billions of users with the potential of innocent people being reported with grave consequences..
Instead a range of systems are used to protect children, which according to Meta do not undermine privacy including:
Meta argues it has introduced over 30 tools and resources to help keep children safe and on Thursday it also revealed a number of new child safety features.
By default children will be unable to receive messages on Instagram or Facebook Messenger from people they do not follow or are not connected to, it announced.
Meta policy already stops adults from messaging teenagers who do not follow them.
""Under this new default setting, teens can only be messaged or added to group chats by people they already follow or are connected"", Meta blogged.
The parental supervision tools will now also give parents the ability to deny a teenagers' requests to change their default safety settings - such as who can direct message them or whether they can view more sensitive content. Previously they were merely notified of a change.

Brazil midfielder Joelinton may have played his last game for Newcastle United, says manager Eddie Howe.
The 27-year-old has been ruled out until May after undergoing surgery on a thigh injury.
Joelinton is out of contract in 2025 and Newcastle are under pressure to comply with the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).
""He has 18 months left on his contract so it's a possibility he'll be sold in the summer,"" said Howe.
""I'm not a fortune teller but it's a possibility. I hope that's not the case. I want him to stay. I love him as a person and player.
""But before a player signs a contract he has to be happy with everything and we are not there yet.""
Joelinton, 27, joined Newcastle in a £40m deal from German side Hoffenheim in 2019 and has won five caps for Brazil.
The midfielder has made 20 appearances in all competitions this season, scoring three goals.
Newcastle's need to comply with PSR - formerly Financial Fair Play - has seen the likes of Joelinton and Almiron linked with exits this month.
Callum Wilson, who United signed from Bournemouth for £20m in 2020, has 18 months left on his contract.
""He's got big ambitions and we want to keep him here but some things are out of our control,"" said Howe of Wilson.
""The club is acting with the long-term interests of the club and they have to. Let's see what happens.""
Kieran Trippier has attracted interest from German giants Bayern Munich, with the 33-year-old also out of contract in 2025.
""We hope he will stay and we're very confident he will be part of our long-term future,"" said Howe.
""But I have to make it clear, he has never asked to leave or even questioned his future here. We've had conversations in the last week and it's always been about Newcastle. It's important I make that clear. His commitment to Newcastle shouldn't be questioned.
""It's a huge compliment that a club like Bayern Munich are interested.""

CH8SVY4JEG_BNL8C3OQHEW8ZZQ,Medibank hack: Russian sanctioned over Australia's worst data breach,By Tiffanie Turnbull,6 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-68064850,"A Russian man has been named and sanctioned for his role in Australia's worst data breach.
The personal information of 9.7m Australians was stolen from the country's largest health insurer, Medibank, in late 2022.
Sensitive documents, including abortion records, were then posted online.
The cyber sanctions - the first of their kind in Australia - include financial penalties and a travel ban for Aleksandr Ermakov.
Little has been made public about Mr Ermakov, but Australian intelligence authorities say he is part of the infamous Russian cyber-crime gang REvil - which has been linked to attacks across Europe, the US and UK.
Announcing the measures on Tuesday, Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil described the Medibank hack as ""the single most devastating cyber-attack we have experienced as a nation"".
""Literally millions of people having personal data about themselves, their family members, taken from them and cruelly placed online for others to see,"" she said.
""These people are cowards and scumbags... we'll unveil who you are and we'll make sure you're accountable.""
Authorities are still investigating the breach, Ms O'Neil added, and more people may face penalties.
It is the first time the government has used cyber sanctions legislation, passed in 2021, which applies financial punishments to people involved in significant online attacks.
Australia has faced a string of large data breaches in recent years, but few - if any - have rocked the country like the Medibank hack.
The cyber criminals had stolen login details which granted them access to all of Medibank's customer data - including the medical records of everyone from athletes and media figures to the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
They began posting the data online after the insurer - with the government's support - refused to pay a ransom.
They first released a set of files named ""good-list"" and ""naughty-list"" which contained, among other things, people's health claims data - including records of treatment for mental health or addiction - as well as names, addresses, birthdates, and government ID numbers.  Soon after they posted: ""added one more file abortions.csv..."", about some customer's end of pregnancy procedures.
Medibank at the time apologised for what it called the ""malicious weaponisation"" of private information, with CEO David Koczkaro warning that the data release could stop people from seeking medical assistance.
Several class actions - which argue the firms should have better protected such sensitive data - have since been launched.

Gary Baird, 64, denies the murder of 60-year-old Susan Baird at their home in the Four Winds area of south Belfast in August 2020.
He has pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter, but this plea was not accepted by the prosecution.
The trial at Belfast Crown Court continues.
On Wednesday, the court heard from a pathologist who said Susan Baird had multiple injuries including fractures to her skull, lacerations on her brain and forehead, and bruising on various parts of her body.
He said the cause of death was ""catastrophic"" head injuries consistent with blows from a hammer.
""It is not possible to accurately determine precisely how many times she had been struck on the head but undoubtedly many blows had been delivered,"" he said.
The pathologist also said that her injuries were so bad that she had to be identified from her dental records.
The jury also heard evidence relating to Mr Baird's mental health.
Both his GP and a mental health social worker confirmed they assessed him in hospital days following the alleged murder and made the recommendation that he be detained under the mental health act.
The mental health social worker said Gary Baird reported hearing voices to multiple medical professionals after his arrest.
He said Mr Baird told him the voice he heard was ""not natural"" and that he had been hearing ""that same voice"" since June 2020.
He also confirmed a bed was found for Mr Baird in the City Hospital's acute mental health inpatient unit and that he was transferred there the day after the assessment where he remained detained for over a year."
CNEU5I78DA_Y870JQ05448J1UR,Kenya housing levy: Blow to William Ruto as court blocks tax,By Jewel Kiriungi,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-68104248,"A Kenyan court has dealt a blow to the government, rejecting its appeal against a temporary block on a controversial housing tax.
In November, the High Court found that the 1.5% monthly levy unfairly targeted Kenyans working in the formal sector and ordered payments to halt.
On Friday, the Court of Appeal ruled that citizens should stop paying the tax until the case is decided.
The government had wanted to carry on collecting the tax in the meantime.
President Ruto has vowed to press ahead with the project regardless, claiming to have public support that was tantamount to an endorsement from God.
""Your say is God's say. So I have enough directive and I will push this housing programme forward,"" he told people at a public rally in Meru County, central Kenya, on Friday.
Kenya's government had begun deducting 1.5% of the gross salaries of locals and foreigners last July, to fund construction of affordable houses for low-income earners.
The levy sparked an outcry from the opposition and a large section of Kenyans, who feel burdened by the raft of taxes introduced under President William Ruto.
The government had argued that suspending the levy would render thousands of workers under the housing programme jobless and breach contracts that had already been signed.
Many Kenyans are relieved by the judgement, although the Court of Appeal is yet to make its final decision.
The ruling comes a week after the appeals court gave the go-ahead for a controversial healthcare insurance levy, which will require people to contribute 2.75% of their monthly salaries to a social healthcare programme.

COV462Z6EM_I81YWIMRGN8S0G9,Former Fujitsu UK CEO quits government role,_,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68106040,"The former UK head of Fujitsu during part of the Post Office scandal has resigned from his role at the Cabinet Office.
Michael Keegan, who is married to Education Secretary Gillian Keegan, is understood to have resigned voluntarily from his part-time role.
He has been approached for comment.
Mr Keegan was Fujitsu's UK chief executive between May 2014 and June 2015. The tech company was behind the faulty Horizon bookkeeping software.
The Cabinet Office declined to comment on his resignation as a Crown Representative, managing the relationship between BAE Systems and the government.
The Horizon system generated false evidence of cash shortfalls at sub-post offices, leading to one of the biggest miscarriages of justice the UK has ever seen.
Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted 700 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses - an average of one a week - based on faulty information from the Horizon system.
Some went to prison for false accounting and theft, while others were financially ruined.
Many maintained their innocence and said they had repeatedly reported problems with the software, but Post Office bosses kept insisting their systems were robust.
During Mr Keegan's time as CEO, flaws in the Horizon computer system began coming to light. In January 2015, the Commons business committee launched in inquiry into Horizon and the Post Office's scheme, hearing evidence from then Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells that the system was robust.
His position as CEO had ended before the legal case by the sub-postmasters against the Post Office began in 2016.
He moved to head up of Fujitsu's Technology Product Business for an area,  including Europe and Middle East, two months before a BBC Panorama expose of the scandal engulfing the Post Office.

Alina Joseph says police had a biased view of her as a black single mother
A 13-year-old boy died after being deliberately pushed into a river in a ""dangerous prank"", a coroner has ruled.
Christopher Kapessa drowned after getting into difficulty in the River Cynon near Fernhill, Rhondda Cynon Taf, in July 2019.
Coroner David Regan said evidence from Jayden Pugh, who said he slipped and fell into Christopher, was ""untrue"".
But Christopher's mother said the injustice she believed her family had endured ""haunted"" her.
Concluding the inquest on Monday, Mr Regan said there was no evidence Christopher's death was caused by racism, following claims by a campaign group which suggested the case was ""akin"" to the murder of Stephen Lawrence.
He said there was no ""evidence of animosity"" between any of the children, who all spoke of Christopher as a friend.
Mr Regan recorded a narrative conclusion, saying Christopher died as a result of submersion.
""The push was a dangerous prank. However, the child responsible did not intend to cause Christopher's death and himself jumped into the water, with other children, as an unsuccessful attempt at rescue,"" he said.
But Christopher's mother Alina Joseph later told the BBC she did not accept the coroner's conclusion that Christopher was pushed by Mr Pugh, now age 19, as a ""prank"".
""I don't agree with that word, that it was a prank,"" she said.
""I feel the person involved knew exactly what he wanted to do, and there was evidence of that, his intention was to put Christopher in the water, so there was no prank about it.""
She said she had no closure following the inquest because ""there hasn't been any justice, so you can't remember him how I would have liked to. I haven't even started grieving.""
In a statement read outside the inquest in Pontypridd, Ms Joseph said she was a victim of the ""institutional racist practices of South Wales Police"", adding that police had closed their investigation within 24 hours and did not investigate racism allegedly suffered by Christopher and the family.
""They had a biased view of me, as a black single mother living in the valleys,"" she said.
During the inquest, Ms Joseph said the family had been subjected to years of racial abuse since moving to Wales from London, with the children allegedly beaten, urinated on and run over.
Ms Joseph said Christopher would have turned 18 this month and added it was difficult watching other children do normal things that Christopher would not be able to do.
""I wonder every day what he would look like now - the only image I have of him is at the age of 13 - and what he would have been doing.
""He would still be cheeky and making us all laugh,"" she said.
Chief Constable Danny Richards said the force had referred its initial investigation to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).
""We hope that this independent scrutiny and the outcome of the inquest proceedings will give us a greater understanding of the issues which have been raised about this case,"" he added.
The IOPC said it upheld one complaint in its investigation, which centred around a meeting between Christopher's family and South Wales Police.
The meeting descended into a disagreement when Christopher's family voiced repeated concerns about possible racism by the force.
""We considered that a police officer's approach at that meeting was ill-judged and insensitive,"" the IOPC said.
There would, however, not be disciplinary action, it said, but additional training on dealing with bereaved families, equality and diversity, and unconscious bias for the officer involved.
Four witnesses told the inquest that Mr Pugh, then aged 14, had pushed Christopher from a ledge into the water, after saying words to the effect of ""shall I push him in"".
Mr Regan said there had also been ""no clear or general understanding as to Christopher's ability to swim"" among his friends before they went to the river that day.
Christopher fell 2.5m (8ft) from the ledge into the river, into water that was 2.5m deep, and said he was likely to have suffered from cold water shock, which would have led to the involuntary ingestion of water, the coroner said.
Other children, including Mr Pugh, jumped in and tried to rescue him, but Christopher disappeared below the surface at about 17:30 BST.
Emergency services attended and Christopher was recovered from the water at almost two hours later at 19:25.
He was later declared dead at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil.
The family's solicitor, Daniel Cooper, said Christopher's death had caused ""unimaginable trauma"" for his family, distress and anxiety for the community in and around Wales, and had raised ""issues of significant public interest"".
""The coroner's findings were clear and unambiguous, Christopher was deliberately and intentionally pushed in the back from behind,"" he said.

CQ0XFG8YR5_RPSRPQ9V34FUWT8,"Council tax bands need overhauling, northern business group says",By Jack Fenwick,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68098173,"Council tax bands in England should be overhauled to fix a crisis in council funding, a group representing northern businesses has urged.
The Northern Powerhouse Partnership (NPP) says the decades-old property valuations underpinning the bands should be redone to make them fairer.
It wants Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to commit to a national revaluation in March's Budget.
The government says it has no plans for a nationwide band revaluation.
NPP's chief executive, Henri Murison, told the BBC that the current council tax system was ""essentially broken"".
In a letter to Mr Hunt, he said the Treasury should carry out a revaluation of all homes in England before the next general election, expected later this year.
The NPP's suggested overhaul would also include higher bands for expensive foreign-owned properties, to level the field between richer and poorer councils.
Current council tax bands are based on a property's value in 1991 in England and Scotland, 2003 in Wales and 2005 in Northern Ireland.
NPP, launched by former chancellor George Osborne to push policies to boost economic growth in the north of England, says the current bands are unfair.
In his letter to the chancellor, Mr Murison said changes would address the ""emergency in local government, and particularly those councils with the lowest tax bases and the greatest needs"".
This week, the government announced an extra Â£500m for councils next year - which Mr Murison called ""a start, but it's nowhere near enough"".
NPP says a homeowner in Hartlepool living in a house worth Â£150,000 is paying more than Â£200 a year more in council tax than someone in Westminster in a property worth Â£8m.
While Mr Murison accepts that ""fixing that problem is actually going to take a long time"", he has called on the government to make council tax fairer within local areas before the next general election.
""At the moment,"" he added, ""you could be living in a house worth twice as much, just down the road from someone and be paying less council tax.
""And that's not really fair on the person down the road, is it? And that could be solved relatively easily and quickly as long as the revaluation work had been done.""
Local Government Secretary Michael Gove, in charge of the council tax system in England, announced a review of the regime in November 2022.
But a year later, one of his ministers told MPs there was ""no review in the formal sense of the term"".
Mr Murison said Mr Gove has been ""a great reformer"" but said in the area of ""levelling up"" economic inequality amongst different regions, he had been ""thwarted a bit by his government colleagues"".
""If he was given free rein, I think we could have seen state council tax reform before the general election, but I'm not sure No 10 necessarily have the reforming zeal that perhaps Michael does.""
NPP has also called for additional council tax bands to be created for foreign-owned properties worth more than Â£2m.
They would be known as super bands and the money would be redistributed to councils around the country, it has suggested.
Conservative peer Lord Pickles, who served as David Cameron's communities and local government secretary between 2010 and 2015, said reforming council tax would be ""profoundly unpopular"".
He told the BBC: ""It should be reformed. It's long overdue being reformed. There should be a revaluation, business rates should be reformed because you can't reform one without the other.
""And governments for many generations have avoided doing that because it will be profoundly unpopular.
""As communities secretary I avoided doing it, but I think I had a reasonable excuse, given the economic circumstances.""
Any revaluation of properties in England is likely to negatively impact voters seen as being part of the traditional Conservative base, such as older voters, wealthier voters and those in the South.
Lord Pickles said it would be ""physically impossible"" to introduce meaningful change to the system before the next general election.
He said it would take ""years to do and years to implement"", but recommended to ""whoever wins the next general election, that this is something they'd do immediately"".
One senior Westminster source said ""revaluations are always problematic because the people that do well out of it say thank-you and forget it within the year and the people that don't [do well out of it] remember it until the next election"".
They said wholesale reform ""wouldn't be possible this side of an election, but I wouldn't put it past them to signal something"" that the next government could build on.
A spokesperson for Mr Gove's Levelling Up Department said it had ""no plans to conduct a nationwide revaluation of council tax bands"".
""Councils are ultimately responsible for their own finances and for setting their own council tax,"" they added.

CQUTFBOB65_YD2FFOK75TQXLJR,Radio Ulster broadcaster Walter Love dies aged 88,_,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-68103356,"The veteran BBC Northern Ireland broadcaster Walter Love has died at the age of 88.
He hosted Radio Ulster's Day By Day and Love in the Afternoon, and presented Sunday staple Love Forty.
With a broadcasting career spanning 77 years, Jazz Club with Walter Love aired its final show in 2023.
In a statement, his family confirmed he passed away on Friday morning in a nursing home after a short illness.
Mr Love was inducted into the Phonographic Performance Ireland Radio Awards Hall of Fame in 2014 for recognition of his skill and passion.
He started out as a freelance contributor to BBC radio in the 1950s, before landing a job as a studio manager in London.
He then spent a decade as a TV newsreader in Belfast before joining Radio Ulster in 1978.
His relatives said he was ""a dearly loved member of the Love family"".
In 1997, he was awarded an MBE for his services to broadcasting.
Director of BBC Northern Ireland Adam Smyth described he was an ""incredible performer on air"" and was ""genial, kind and cheerful"".
He added Mr Love had ""a hint of mischief"".
""He loved presenting radio programmes and his melodious voice, ability to create rapport, and his encyclopaedic knowledge of music made him one of our longest-serving and best-loved broadcasters,"" Mr Smyth continued."
CRDXIPO4MJ_LBVQX6GN56F3FNE,Amy Johnson: Fragment of her doomed plane comes up at auction,By Kevin Shoesmith,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-68088984,"A fragment of wreckage believed to be from aviator Amy Johnson's doomed aircraft is to be auctioned.
Ms Johnson, the first woman to fly solo from the UK to Australia, died 11 years after the feat when her plane crashed into the Thames on 5 January 1941.
A piece of debris, believed to be from the plane's parachute door, has only now come to public attention.
It will be sold by Hansons Auctioneers on 28 February, with an estimate of Â£1,000-Â£2,000.
Matt Crowson, head of militaria at Hansons, said: ""I was amazed to receive an email asking 'Would you be interested in a piece of Amy Johnson's aircraft wreckage?'""
The London-based seller had, according to Mr Crowson, inherited the item from his uncle, Ronald Clark.
Mr Clark is said to have retrieved it from the water and put in his pocket during efforts to rescue Hull-born Ms Johnson.
In 1941 Mr Clark was a Royal Navy able seaman on HMS Berkeley, an escort vessel in the English Channel.
It was one of a number of boats that raced to the crash scene, near Herne Bay, after witnesses reporting seeing a parachute deploy. Ms Johnson's body was never recovered.
Mr Crowson said the fragment, believed to be from the Airspeed Oxford plane, was significant.
""No other pieces of the aircraft are thought to exist,"" he said. ""The fragment is constructed from two layers of thin plywood, glued together and set at a 45 degree angle to provide maximum strength.
""The surface paint has been compared to an existing Airspeed Oxford in London's RAF Museum. Given the distinctive green shade and traces of yellow, it's likely the piece was from the parachute exit door. This was the only part of the aircraft constructed from ply, the fuselage section being linen-covered.""
After finding the fragment, Mr Clark is said to have inscribed the words ""piece of fuselage from Amy Johnson's plane, crashed 1941"" on the reverse.
Mr Crowson said checks confirmed the sailor's service on HMS Berkeley, which was sent to the crash site.
""The vendor remembers his uncle telling him the story in the 1950s and showing him the fragment,"" said Mr Crowson.
""The technical aspects of the style of manufacture, paint colours, service records, anecdotal evidence and the fact that this type of aircraft would not have routinely been in the area, all add up to it being correct.""
Before World War Two Ms Johnson worked as a commercial pilot, a journalist and even a fashion model. Early in the war she joined the Air Transport Auxiliary, which transported RAF aircraft around the country.

Cruise acknowledged the probe, as it released findings from its review of the October 2023 incident, in which one of its cars dragged a pedestrian who had been thrown into its path.
California revoked Cruise's permit.
Cruise, which also pulled its cars from the road elsewhere, said its actions in the aftermath fell ""woefully short"".
""We are profoundly remorseful both for the injuries to the pedestrian, as well as for breaching the trust of our regulators, the media, and the public,"" the company said.
The report commissioned by GM and conducted by an outside law firm found the firm did not provide a full picture to regulators in the immediate aftermath of the accident and did not update the press as it learned more.
It ascribed these lapses to ""a failure of leadership within Cruise, inadequate and uncoordinated internal processes, mistakes in judgment, an ""us versus them"" mentality with government officials, and a fundamental misunderstanding of regulatory requirements and expectations"".
The report said it had not found evidence to date that Cruise leadership or personnel intended to deceive or mislead when they briefed regulators on the accident on 3 October 2023.
It said technical issues had prevented a full viewing of its video of the accident, in which the car dragged the pedestrian for about 20 feet. But staff did not verbally provide an account to make up for that lapse, the report noted.
Staff also responded to press inquiries without being aware of the pull over manoeuvre and did not update their accounts.
Cruise, which is majority owned by General Motors, was one of the first companies to get a commercial robotaxi service going, winning approval for regulators to start charging for rides in San Francisco in August despite objections from activists, police and fire officials and others.
At the time, Cruise hailed it as an ""historic milestone"". It had predicted that the business could generate $1bn in annual revenue by next year.
In the weeks after the accident, a slew of leaders at Cruise, including its chief executive, left the company.
It announced plans to cut about 24% of its staff - or roughly 900 jobs -  in December.
Cruise said on Thursday that it was cooperating with authorities, including the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Safety authorities were already known to be investigating.
""We believe that, over time, autonomous vehicles can significantly reduce the number and severity of car collisions which result in more than 40,000 deaths on U.S. roads each year. This is what motivates our work,"" the company said.
""We know our license to operate must be earned and is ultimately granted by regulators and the communities we serve. We are focused on advancing our technology and earning back public trust.""

CVTMM6LU5G_I38YYCTKB6EWQMS,Fibrus: Storm-damaged broadband repairs may take a week,By Julian Fowler,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-68087534,"More than 3,000 Fibrus broadband customers have been left without internet following damage caused by this week's storms Isha and Jocelyn.
Customers have been told it could take  a week for the service to be restored.
Storm damage affected more than 5,200 customers - about 7% of the Fibrus customer base - with the company blaming strong winds and heavy rain for ""significant issues"".
Many of those affected are in rural parts of Northern Ireland.
Fibrus said its was ""working really hard to restore all services as quickly as possible"".
""This may take up to a week but we are aiming to get things back to normal within the next 2-3 days.""
Some customers have criticised the company for a lack of information and for failing to provide a clear timescale for repairs.
The internet outage has made it impossible for John McCann from Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, to work from home.
""The broadband went out on Sunday night in the storm, which is entirely understandable,"" he told BBC News NI.
The following morning, he found out a tree had fallen down about 21 yards (19m) from his house and his wife called Fibrus to find out when their service would be restored.
""The customer service representative was rather off-hand with her: 'Yes, we know about that, there's over 150 calls,' and it was shrugged off in that manner,"" Mr McCann said.
His wife then contacted Fibrus using their online chat service but she received no information about the repair timetable.
After a further phone call to customer services on Wednesday, the couple still do not know when they will have broadband service again.
""As I joked to a friend, it's like I've been transported in a time warp back to 1990,"" Mr McCann said.
""I compare this to the sort of service that we get from the electricity service who also are experiencing the same issues with the storm, with lines having come down.
""But you can go to their website, you can click on the map, you can see where the outages are, you can see when they are going to fix them.
""If the electricity service can do this, surely Fibrus can do the same thing?""
He said this week's severe weather spell was not the first to damage infrastructure and would not be the last, and he questioned whether Fibrus had employed enough staff to deal with customer queries.
""I don't have a problem with the fact that yes, this has been an exceptional storm,"" Mr McCann said.
""Naturally there is a lot of damage there, that's going to take some time to deal with that, but they need to communicate with us.""
In a statement Fibrus said it takes its service provision ""very seriously"".
The firm said its ""first and primary priority in responding to these outages has been to safeguard the public's safety as well as the health and safety of its own employees, as they worked in difficult circumstances to assess the scale of the impact"".
""With the storms subsiding, Fibrus has deployed all available resource on the ground to restore services, in particular, focusing efforts on areas most affected.
""Some of the damage caused by the storms is complex and difficult to resolve.
""Given the issues that remain to be addressed, it may take a number of days to fully restore all customers to service.
""Repair work will continue as is necessarily, including into the weekend, if required.""
It is not clear whether Fibrus customers will be entitled to compensation.
The company is not signed up to the Ofcom automatic compensation scheme for delayed repairs, which offers a payment of Â£9.33 each day after two full working days following a loss of service.
In 2020 Fibrus won the contract to provide Project Stratum - a government-backed scheme to improve rural broadband across Northern Ireland.
The total funding for Project Stratum was Â£165m, with Â£150m coming from the confidence-and-supply agreement deal signed between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and the Conservative Party in 2017.
The remaining Â£15m came from Stormont's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs.
That project is due to be completed by March of this year.

CZF241Z1YJ_0V33GJZLD02FO8N,HS2: Mayors to meet minister about alternatives,By Katy Austin & Sam Gruet,3 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68087768,"New plans for a privately funded alternative to HS2's now-scrapped Birmingham to Manchester section will be presented to the transport secretary next week.
Birmingham's mayor Andy Street told the BBC that he and Manchester mayor Andy Burnham will meet with Mark Harper to discuss bringing in the private sector.
Mr Street said the plan could involve a dedicated line between the cities.
But he said it was ""highly unlikely"" to be exactly the same as HS2.
In October, the Prime Minister announced the parts of high speed rail line linking the West Midlands to Manchester, and to the East Midlands, would be cancelled.
Rishi Sunak also said HS2's key new station at Euston would only be built if private investment was secured.
Speaking to the BBC at the official launch of construction at HS2's Birmingham Curzon Street station, the West Midlands mayor said the proposed alternative route would run between where HS2 ends in Handsacre, north of Birmingham, and south Stockport, where the Northern Powerhouse Rail begins.
Northern Powerhouse Rail is a rail project which plans to speed up links between Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds.
HS2 trains are currently expected to continue north to Manchester after Handsacre on existing conventional tracks.
Mr Street said options being considered were ""maybe a dedicated line, maybe upgrades to the existing line"". The aim would be to relieve the ""very very congested"" West Coast Mainline, improving connectivity and reliability.
But he said it would be unlikely to be exactly the same as HS2 as the project was so over budget.
Mr Street confirmed the research he had done into alternative rail improvements was being done with the prime minister's approval. He gave no further details of the plans and said they were in their early stages.
The mayors announced in December they had started a group involving private sector firms to look at options to tackle the rail route between the Midlands and the North.
The group, chaired by infrastructure expert Sir David Higgins, would look at ""the cost, capacity, and economic uplift of changes to the rail route, helping to identify packages of potential interventions and potential private sector funding models and solutions,"" a press release at the time said.

The transport secretary said yesterday he would ""listen with an open mind"" to what the mayors came up with. He cautioned that he was ""somewhat sceptical"" the private sector could deliver without any cost to the taxpayer.
A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""We have already cancelled HS2 Phase 2 and we're getting on with delivering our Network North plan - this hasn't changed.""
Mr Harper recently lifted ""safeguarding"" of land along the now-cancelled HS2 route between the West Midlands and Crewe.
It is not the same as selling back land or property, but means the land is no longer earmarked for HS2.
Land near Handsacre will still be protected, which is where a connection will be built linking HS2 to the main line, on which HS2 trains will now travel on to Manchester using conventional tracks.

DAXRB9NBQY_4WVHFMXPX2D1QBE,UK not seeking confrontation with Houthis - Sunak,"By James Gregory & Frank Gardner, security correspondent",5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68069539,"This video can not be played
Rishi Sunak says Britain âwas not seeking a confrontationâ but would not hesitate to act again
The UK will not hesitate to take further military action against Houthi targets in Yemen if the group continues Red Sea attacks, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has told MPs.
Mr Sunak said the UK was not seeking confrontation with the Iran-backed group, but would continue to act in self-defence.
It follows overnight strikes with the US in Yemen.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he backed the ""targeted action"".
Four RAF Typhoons and two Voyager tankers took part in a second wave of joint US-UK action against the Houthis on Monday night, following previous raids on 11 January.
They targeted two military sites used to support attacks on shipping north of Yemen's capital, Sanaa. The prime minister said all intended targets were destroyed.
Addressing the House of Commons on Tuesday, Mr Sunak said: ""We are not seeking a confrontation. We urge the Houthis and those who enable them to stop these illegal and unacceptable attacks.
""But, if necessary, the United Kingdom will not hesitate to respond again in self-defence.""
""Maximum care"" was taken to protect civilians in the strikes, he added. No civilians have died as a result of the strikes.
Sir Keir was not briefed beforehand, but Downing Street said he and Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle were informed while British fighter jets were in the air at about 22:00 on Monday.
Since November, the Houthis have launched dozens of attacks on commercial vessels travelling through the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.
The group says it is targeting ships linked to Israel in response to the military ground operation in Gaza. However, many of the vessels which have been attacked have no connection with Israel.
Yemen's internationally recognised government, which is now based in Riyadh, Saudia Arabia, has condemned Houthi attacks.
What was originally intended to be a short, sharp shock for the Houthis has now descended into a repetitive tit-for-tat.
The latest strikes will have made a dent in their arsenal.
But the Houthis, who took over much of Yemen 10 years ago, have a large supply of missiles and drones and show every sign of continuing their attacks on shipping, undeterred by the eight US-led air strikes so far this year.
The US and UK have little choice but to continue hitting Houthi targets as long as their attacks continue - to give up now would be tantamount to ceding control of a crucial global shipping route to a proscribed terror group backed by Iran.
So far, the strikes have been precise and calibrated with minimal human casualties, but that may change.
The longer these exchanges carry on, the greater the risk of escalation. There is a real risk that in due course Yemeni civilians may die in these retaliatory air strikes, which could ignite a wave of anti-western anger across the wider Middle East.
The Houthis have vowed vengeance against US and British interests, believing they have God on their side. They have survived eight years of civil war and countless airstrikes by their neighbour, Saudi Arabia.
They have strategic patience, claiming they will outlast their western adversaries.
They also accuse the US and UK of supporting Israel with its military action against them.
But Mr Sunak said there was ""no link between our actions of self-defence in the Red Sea and the situation in Israel and Gaza"".
""Those who make that link do the Houthis' work for them,"" he told MPs.
There have been at least 12 further attacks by the Houthis since 11 January, including on Monday night ahead of the latest strikes.
Incidents have increased in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since the first wave of US-UK strikes.
But the prime minister insisted the latest British military action had worked to ""degrade capability"", though noted there ""may be a difference between reducing and eliminating"" the threat.
""The targets are specifically selected on the basis of intelligence, military sites which impact the security and safety of seafarers and shipping, and to that end I'm confident the strikes are being carried out in a way that's effective and achieving their aim,"" he told MPs.
Mr Sunak said action against the Houthis had been a ""last resort"" and only after repeated warnings had been ignored, adding that the UK in both waves of attacks had acted in order to ""protect innocent lives and preserve the freedom of navigation"".
The government's aim is to stop the illegal sale of weapons to the Houthis and impose sanctions to cut off the group's financial resources, he added.
The government has published the legal advice it received for the operation, which concluded the strikes were legal under international law.
Sir Keir Starmer backed the strikes and said attacks on vessels needed to stop.
""They are designed to destabilise us so we must stand united and strong, they bring danger to ordinary civilians who are working hard at sea, so we must protect them, and they aim to disrupt the flow of goods, food and medicines, so we must not let them go unaddressed,"" he said.
A ""general debate"" on military action in the region will take place in the Commons on Wednesday. MPs will not be asked to consider and vote on a specific motion.
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who has called for a vote, said his party accepted the case for the strikes but that there had been ""remarkably little clarity about what the next steps are and when the UK's objectives will be judged to have been fulfilled"".
Downing Street has defended the decision not to consult Parliament first, arguing that the government was ""acting with precedent"" and that ""there isn't a requirement to hold a vote"".
Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron will be visiting the region this week.

DBO8PD6B20_9D6ZII212EWMGA7,Death penalty: Kenneth Eugene Smith says wait for untested execution like 'torture',By Tom Bateman,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68053917,"Kenneth Eugene Smith is set to become the first person in the US to be executed by nitrogen gas. As he spends his final days on death row, he says he is haunted by thoughts of the untested procedure.
Warning: This article contains graphic descriptions of methods of execution, which could upset some readers.
The first time Kenneth Eugene Smith was about to die, Alabama's executioners had several hours to kill him.
They bound the condemned man to a gurney in the so-called ""death chamber"" of Holman Correctional Facility and tried to inject him with a lethal blend of chemicals.
But they failed.
Unable to raise a vein, which Smith's lawyers said left him with numerous incisions, they abandoned the attempt as the clock hit midnight and the state's death warrant expired.
That was November 2022. Now, Alabama will try to kill him again.
This time, the US state has authorised a plan to suffocate Smith by strapping an air-tight mask over his face and forcing him to inhale pure nitrogen, an inert gas that would starve his body of oxygen.
The UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights last week said the never-before-used method could amount to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and called for a halt.
A final appeal ruling is still outstanding after a federal court rejected his lawyers' request for an injunction. Smith is due to be executed on Thursday.
Smith was one of two men convicted in 1989 of murdering a preacher's wife, Elizabeth Sennett, who was stabbed and beaten to death in a $1,000 (Â£786) killing-for-hire. He is one of the only men in modern America to be taken twice for execution, and the first to face nitrogen gassing.
""My body is simply breaking down, I keep losing weight,"" Smith told the BBC in a written answer to questions we put to him via an intermediary.
Face-to-face meetings between journalists and death row prisoners are prohibited in Alabama. We reached him by telephone late last week, but he asked not to proceed with an interview as he said he had become seriously unwell.
""I'm nauseous all the time. Panic attacks hit regularly... This is just a small part of what I've been dealing with daily. Torture, basically,"" he wrote. He called for Alabama to ""stop [the execution]. Before it's too late"".
The state maintains that nitrogen gas execution will cause unconsciousness quickly but it has not presented any plausible evidence.
Medical experts and campaigners have warned about the risk of catastrophic mishaps, ranging from violent convulsions to survival in a vegetative state, and even the possibility of gas leaking from the mask and killing others in the room, including Mr Smith's religious advocate.
""I'm certain that Kenny's not afraid to die, he's made that very clear. But I think he's afraid that he will be even further tortured in the process,"" says his spiritual advisor Rev Dr Jeff Hood. He has signed a legal waiver from the state spelling out the dangers of a nitrogen leak.
""I'll be a number of feet from him, and I have been warned repeatedly by various medical experts that I'm risking my life to do this. If there's any sort of leak in the hose, if there's any sort of leak from the mask, from the seal around his face, it could certainly lead to nitrogen leaking into the room,"" Dr Hood told the BBC.
That amounts to an intolerable level of danger, says one expert who co-authored an investigation sent to the UN.
Nitrogen makes up 78% of the air we breathe, passing in and out of the body harmlessly with every breath. But breathing pure nitrogen slowly deprives the body's cells and organs of oxygen, causing them to break down and eventually leading to death, said Dr Joel Zivot, an associate professor in anaesthesiology at Emory University's School of Medicine.
He warns of unintended risks from the presence of pure nitrogen changing the oxygen-to-nitrogen ratio in the execution chamber, especially as Smith could hold his breath or move his head against the mask, or the equipment could leak.
""Some of it will be exhaled [by Smith] along with carbon dioxide and some of it may leak out of the mask. And I think that that presents a real and material danger to this execution,"" Dr Zivot said.
The Alabama Department of Corrections appears to have attempted to address this concern in the waiver form it sent to Dr Hood.
It says there are ""wall-mounted oxygen sensors"" in the execution chamber. But it also warns the spiritual advisor of the generic risks posed when nitrogen rapidly displaces oxygen causing ""loss of consciousness without warning"". It urges him to stay at least three feet away from Smith at all times, warning of a ""small area risk"" of ""nitrogen outflow"".
Dr Zivot believes the risk assessment amounts to a form of pseudo science, since execution by nitrogen has never been attempted, and it is not clear how long it will take Smith to die.
""There is no science. This is just really pulling anecdotes and imagining and trying to think of what may occur based upon, again, other pieces of information that are really not at all a scientific inquiry.""
Dr Zivot also accused the Alabama authorities of a ""terrible"" track record of ""cruel"" executions.
""I guess I have to conclude that Kenneth Smith must be the worst man in America, because Alabama is so hell bent on killing him, that they're willing to kill other people to kill him,"" Dr Zivot told the BBC.
""Imagine the firing squad where all the witnesses are lined up next to the person you're about to execute, and you get them all to sign waivers, because it turns out that the guys you've got are not very good shots, and so it's possible that they might shoot you too. So these are some of the things I can imagine that could happen with nitrogen gas,"" he said.
""What we do know about nitrogen gas is that in an early study with healthy volunteers, almost all of them at about 15 into 20 seconds of breathing had a generalised seizure,"" he said.
In such a scenario, Smith could lose consciousness or suffer a series of violent spasms.
Alabama has one of the highest per capita execution rates in the US and has 165 people currently on death row.
Since 2018, the state has been responsible for three botched attempts at lethal injection in which the condemned inmates survived. The failures led to an internal review which largely placed blame on the prisoners themselves.
It said their lawyers had tried to save their lives by ""running out the clock"" with eleventh hour court appeals for stays of execution. The review said this caused ""unnecessary deadline pressure"" for their executioners.
This time, the team will get a longer ""time frame,"" rather than a midnight deadline, to execute Smith.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, who has the power to halt judicial killings, declined to comment on the expert warnings and the allegations against the state. The Attorney General's office called the UN's concerns ""as unfounded as Smith's"".
It said in a statement: ""The trial court examined Smith's challenge, heard from multiple medical experts, and determined that Smith's concerns about nitrogen hypoxia were 'speculative' and 'theoretical'.""
It added: ""We intend to proceed with his execution on January 25th.""
Republican state lawmaker Reed Ingram, who voted in favour of authorising execution by nitrogen gas, rejected the UN's criticism.
""I don't know about degrading, I don't know about inhumane, I think we're improving. I think the process may be better than what he did to the victim,"" he told the BBC.
""Our governor is a Christian. She's debated this whole thing and she thinks it's measured. I'm sure it's heavy on her mind, but it's the law,"" he said.
The BBC approached the family of Elizabeth Sennett, who said they would not make any comment until Thursday.
In 1996 a jury recommended life in prison without parole for Smith, but the judge overruled them and sentenced him to death. At his trial he admitted to being present when the victim was killed, but says he did not take part in the attack.

DHAJ8EQOCK_IR064GMX9RBM0J7,Why has Alabama executed a man using nitrogen gas?,By Mike Wendling,2 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68097008,"A death row inmate has been executed using a novel method. Why have authorities in Alabama used nitrogen gas, and why is it controversial?
Kenneth Eugene Smith was originally scheduled to be put to death with lethal drugs in November 2022.
Prison staff inserted one intravenous line, but two lines were required to administer the lethal injection.
After they struggled for an hour to insert the second IV, the execution was called off.
But Smith - who was convicted of the murder-for-hire of a preacher's wife in 1988 - was eventually executed using nitrogen gas instead.
It's a controversial method that had never been used before by a US state.
And it represents the latest step in the search for a new way to execute convicted criminals - even as the death penalty has become less popular over time.
Around half of US states still have death penalty laws. Execution methods vary, but some states still allow execution by hanging, firing squad or the electric chair.
According to the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), a not-for-profit organisation that is critical of how executions are administered, no method has been found to violate the US Constitution's ban on ""cruel and unusual punishments"", although some state courts have outlawed some methods.
In recent decades, however, most states have converged on lethal injection - the administration of intravenous drugs that sedate and kill the convict - as the main execution method.
Texas was the first state to execute a convicted criminal with lethal injection, in 1982.
Last year, 24 people were executed in the US - most of those in Florida and Texas, and all by lethal injection.
The process, however, is not always straightforward. Several months prior to Smith's previous botched execution, Alabama authorities failed to put to death another death row inmate, Alan Miller, also because of difficulties inserting an IV needle. Several other lethal injection executions have also not gone according to plan.
And states have recently had difficulty in obtaining lethal injection drugs. In some cases, drug manufacturers won't sell them, or no longer produce them.
The UK and the European Union banned exports of the chemicals in 2011, and five years later American drugs giant Pfizer, the last open-market source of lethal injection drugs, announced it would no longer sell them to be used in executions.
The result is that states have been scrambling for other ways to execute prisoners.
Texas, for instance, has sourced its deadly chemicals from a secret list of private ""compounding pharmacies"", which mix their own drugs.
Prison officials strapped a mask to Smith's face and administered the pure nitrogen gas.
The gas itself is not poisonous - nitrogen makes up more than three-quarters of the earth's atmosphere.
But in pure concentrated form, breathing in the gas chokes off oxygen to the brain, a process called nitrogen hypoxia.
The use of nitrogen gas in executions has been approved by three states, including Alabama in 2018, and has withstood various legal challenges since.

Watch: How nitrogen became a form of execution in the US
The procedure had critics even before Smith's execution.
""It's an experimental procedure,"" says Dr Jeff Keller, President of the American College of Correctional Physicians. ""Many things can go wrong.""
Deborah Denno, a criminologist at Fordham Law School who specialises in research into death penalty methods, said the procedure ""is supposed to be painless"".
""But I have to emphasise - that's in theory,"" she says.
""These masks don't usually don't fit people,"" she says. ""They're not airtight, air can get in.""
Smith could have started vomiting or survived the attempted execution with brain damage, she says.
Proponents of the method reject criticism and point to examples of nitrogen hypoxia occurring in industrial accidents, with victims apparently becoming unaware of what is happening to them.
One study prepared for Oklahoma lawmakers considering whether to allow nitrogen gas executions cited research that concluded ""without oxygen present, inhalation of only 1Â­2 breaths of pure nitrogen will cause a sudden loss of consciousness"".
Alabama State Attorney General Steve Marshall has called nitrogen gas ""perhaps the most humane method of execution ever devised"".
Some witnesses to Smith's execution, though, said he did not lose consciousness within seconds and that he inhaled the gas for many minutes, thrashing all the while, before finally succumbing.
The flurry of attention over Smith's execution comes as enthusiasm for the death penalty has ebbed across much of the US.
The number of executions is down substantially from a peak of 98 in 1999, according to the DPIC.
Not only are fewer death sentences being carried out, in fewer states - just 10 have executed a prisoner in the last decade - but fewer death penalties are being handed out by courts.
""We've seen a big change in American support for the death penalty,"" says Robin Maher, the DPIC's executive director.
Polling organization Gallup, which has been tracking public attitudes towards the death penalty for nearly a century, says that 53% of Americans favour the death penalty for convicted murders.
That figure is down from a high of 80% which the survey registered 30 years ago.
Ms Maher says a variety of factors resulted in the death penalty becoming less common - not only botched executions, but nearly 200 exonerations of death row inmates, legal changes which prohibit mentally impaired people and juveniles from being put to death, and the increasing reluctance of juries to hand down death sentences.
""I expect that trend will continue,"" she says.

DO1WJR1JQC_VDFZIOB01KX18BJ,737 Max 9: Boeing jets cleared to fly after mid-air incident,By Mariko Oi,4 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68090175,"This video can not be played
Watch: On board flight during mid-air blow out
The US aviation regulator says it will allow Boeing's 737 Max 9 jets to resume flying after inspections are completed.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded 171 of the planes after an unused door broke away mid-flight.
United Airlines and Alaska Airlines plan to start returning the jets to service in the coming days.
But the FAA says it will not yet allow Boeing to expand production of its best-selling narrow body family of jets, which includes the 737 Max 9.
The unprecedented decision by the regulator marks more bad news for the plane making giant.
""This won't be back to business as usual for Boeing,"" FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement.
""We will not agree to any request from Boeing for an expansion in production or approve additional production lines for the 737 Max until we are satisfied that the quality control issues uncovered during this process are resolved,"" he added.
The announcement that the planes will be allowed to fly again once inspections have been completed is welcome news for Alaska Airlines and United Airlines, which had to cancel thousands of flights.
Alaska Airlines said it expects ""to bring our first few planes back into scheduled commercial service on Friday"", with more planes added every day as inspections are completed.
United Airlines said it had received final approval from the FAA to complete the process of returning its 79-strong fleet of 737 Max 9 planes to service.
The company's chief operations officer Toby Enqvist said the airline was preparing to start flying the aircraft again from 28 January.
On 5 January a door plug on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 blew off shortly after take-off, terrifying passengers, and forcing an emergency return to the Portland, Oregon airport.
Bosses of both Alaska Airlines and United Airlines have expressed frustration with Boeing over the grounding of the 737 Max 9, which has caused major disruptions to their services.
In an interview with NBC News, Alaska Airlines boss Ben Minicucci said there was ""no doubt"" that the plane came ""off the production line with a faulty door"".
He said airline inspections since the incident found ""many"" loose bolts. ""I'm more than frustrated and disappointed,"" he said. ""I am angry.""
United Airlines chief executive, Scott Kirby, also told CNBC that he is ""disappointed"".
""The Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel's back for us,"" he said, adding that ""we're going to build a plan that doesn't have the [Boeing] Max 10 in it"".
United also said earlier this week that it expected to lose money because of the grounding.
On Wednesday, the head of Boeing, David Calhoun, faced questions from lawmakers in Washington to explain what led to the mid-air emergency.
The latest incident raises fresh questions about the safety of Boeing's aircraft.
The company faced intense scrutiny after two fatal crashes of 737 Max 8 passenger jets in 2018 and 2019, which killed 346 people.

DP9POS1AZ5_846TTTOIL8APB0O,Church as estate agent is a sign of the times,By Ian Hamilton,7 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-68031669,"It is no secret that congregations across Scotland are shrinking.
But there is a section of the Church of Scotland website that suggests the organisation could almost reinvent itself as an estate agent.
The ""Properties for sale"" page offers everything from plots of land to former council houses and church buildings, ranging from offers over Â£40,000 to Â£400,000.
The Reverend David Cameron, Convener of the Church of Scotland Assembly Trustees, sees it as a sign of the times.
Looking at the entry for a church in Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, an entire church is up for sale - complete with hall and modern fitted kitchen.
""If you happen to have Â£160,000, it could be yours,"" he says.
The Church of Scotland faces a challenge.
With a portfolio of over 5,000 properties, second only to the National Trust for Scotland, it grapples with dwindling memberships and incomes.
Mr Cameron explains: ""We have a surplus of buildings and a large property portfolio. With reducing membership and income, and the challenge to maintain these properties, we need to address our estate.""
The condition of these properties varies from the well-maintained to worse-for-wear. This inconsistency underscores the need for a strategic approach to property management.
Mr Cameron says: ""We are not a heritage society. Our focus is on spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ.""
However, the heritage aspect of these buildings often overshadows their primary mission.
Selling churches, especially in rural areas, is sensitive. In some communities, these buildings are the only communal spaces available. Urban and rural settings alike face the high costs of maintenance and utilities.
But these church sales can turn these historic buildings into unique spaces.
St Luke's in Glasgow's east end, under the leadership of Operation Manager Alexander Riches, illustrates this transformation.
Since 2015, St Luke's has become a busy bar and concert venue. The renovation was no small feat.
""The biggest challenge was really just trying to get a vision in place to turn it into what you see now,"" Mr Riches says.
The project involved substantial investment, including Â£1.4m for regeneration and Â£70,000 for each stained glass window.
""When the owners first acquired the church, it was in a dilapidated state,"" he adds.
""The room we are sitting in was overrun with pigeons and practically falling apart.
""This was just the church hall. The adjacent building, which had been an active church, was still filled with pews and quite decrepit.""
Mr Riches advises potential buyers to approach such projects with caution.
""It's not a decision to be taken lightly. Ensure that you have the right partners involved.""
Kimberly Guthrie, from Scotland's Town Partnership, sees potential in repurposing these buildings.
""There are so many examples... weddings, music venues, community spaces, art spaces, coffee shops,"" she says.
But she recognises the sensitivities around many of these buildings.
""These cultural assets are absolutely key as a regeneration strategy across our towns,"" she says.
""These buildings are the heart of some of our local places. They've got history, and they also encourage community appreciation of what we've got in the new era, as opposed to what we once had.""
The Church of Scotland navigates a delicate balance between preserving its rich heritage and ensuring financial viability.
With proposals to sell underused buildings, the funds raised could support community aid programs and a shift to more efficient spaces aligned with current needs.
The Church faces mounting challenges in preserving an extensive property portfolio amid declining attendance and resources.
The decisions made in the coming years will not only shape the future of these historic buildings but also reflect the evolving role of the Church in modern Scotland."

Dean Garforth, who has previously lived in Widnes, Cheshire, was on the run for two years before he was arrested in Marbella, Spain, after trying to flee from police on an e-bike in 2022.
The 31-year-old admitted conspiracy to supply Class A and B drugs and transfer prohibited weapons and ammunition.
He was sentenced at Chester Crown Court to 18 years and eight months in prison.
Cheshire Police said Garforth operated at the top of the chain and used the EncroChat communications network to discuss the supply of substantial amounts of Class A and Class B drugs with other criminals.
Detectives began building a case against him in April 2020, monitoring and analysing his messages under the handle Slickcliff.
The following month a transit van failed to stop for officers on Bradley Way, Widnes.
It was later found parked in Norlands Park, Widnes.
In a search of the van, police found a mobile phone linked to Garforth.
The device was used by Garforth to send messages through the now defunct EncroChat.
From March 2020 and July 2020, Garforth spoke to his associates about receiving and arranging for multiple deliveries of cocaine, cannabis, firearms, and ammunition in north-west England.
A warrant was executed at his home address in October 2020 but officers discovered he had fled to Spain, police said.
In January 2022, he featured in a list of 12 of the UK's most-wanted suspects believed to be hiding in Spain.
Garforth was riding an e-bike on a street in Marbella when he was arrested in a pre-planned operation in October 2022 and was later extradited to the UK.
Det Ch Insp Nick Henderson said: ""Garforth, like many criminals, believed EncroChat would always be a safe and secure service to message freely and openly without being detected.
""Unbeknown to him, our detectives were watching.
""The encrypted device was previously perceived as being an untouchable way of communicating freely about criminality without being detected by police. Once it was cracked by law enforcement, it meant those using it would find it almost impossible to deny their involvement in serious and organised crime.""

Watch the moment Edinburgh tenant records rent row on secret video
A tenant has told of the moment he was confronted by a man he believed to be his landlord during a rent row.
Jason Chen took a secret video recording of the incident where the man is seen waving a stool during the dispute over Mr Chen's Edinburgh flat going without hot water for 28 days.
Mr Chen believes the man in the video is flat owner and controversial businessman Mark Fortune.
Mr Fortune denied this and said he was at the dentist in France at the time.
Police Scotland said its inquiries into the incident were ongoing.
Mr Chen, who withheld some of his rent as a result of the hot water issue, showed BBC Scotland News text messages that he considered threatening which he received during the dispute.
This included one sent in November from an unknown number which included a threat that Mr Chen would be ""spending Christmas in hospital"".
Mr Fortune said none of these messages came from him.
Mr Chen said the confrontation left him frightened and added ""nobody deserves to be treated like this"".
Mr Fortune has been refused entry to Scotland's landlord register and has a previous conviction for threatening tenants.
Mr Chen moved into a shared city centre flat in April last year after signing an agreement with Edinburgh Rent Ltd, whose only director, according to Companies House, is Mr Fortune.
Mr Chen said the flat went 28 days without hot water last October so he messaged the contact number for Edinburgh Rent to say he was withholding some of the rent until the issue was resolved.
Edinburgh Rent said the problem was caused by the electrics being overloaded by tenants and the pair fell into a dispute over WhatsApp.
In these exchanges, seen by BBC Scotland News, Mr Chen - who is from Taiwan - is repeatedly warned his possessions will be cleared from the flat unless he pays up.
The identity of the person sending the messages from Edinburgh Rent is not revealed but one exchange includes a denial that Mr Fortune is the landlord.
Mr Fortune told BBC Scotland News he did not send these messages and does not have access to the number used by Edinburgh Rent.
On the morning of 25 October last year Mr Chen received a text from a random number in the morning saying ""hi Jason will see shortly mate"".
Mr Chen was home alone and in bed when, later that day, the man he believes was Mr Fortune let himself into the flat and told him he had to pay the full outstanding amount or faced being kicked out.
The man then returned a few hours later and Mr Chen, who was still in bed, reached over to his phone to secretly video the exchange.
In the video, the man tells Jason: ""I'll put everyone out, I couldn't care less.
""If it is not paid everything will be turned off in the flat tonight, there will be no electric, there will be no heating, no gas, no internet, no nothing.
""There will come a point where I won't be very amicable to you.""
He is then seen picking up a white stool and motioning it towards Mr Chen, he said: ""The likes of this, you know what I mean?""
Before leaving he says: ""You can Google me.""
Mr Chen only agreed to speak to BBC Scotland News if the interview was published after he left the UK for Taiwan.
He said: ""I was quite surprised, I never expect someone will just show in my room, in person to threaten me like pay your rent right now or move out.
""I would say it was my first time meeting people so aggressive to me, I was quite nervous.""
He added: ""I know I have to do something to protect myself so I take my phone, which was sitting on the bed, and secretly recording the landlord. He did not notice, he just keep speaking threateningly to me.""
Mr Chen paid up his outstanding rent after the confrontation as he felt he had no choice, despite being told by housing sector experts that he had the right not to pay.
He added: ""My flat mates all come from different countries, none of us are local people, when this happened to us we definitely feel like is this normal?
""These things happen here and nobody cares. Nobody deserves to be treated like this.""
Mr Fortune owns a number of flats in Edinburgh which are rented out by companies owned by or connected to him.
The businessman, who was refused entry to Scotland's landlord register in 2013, has faced years of complaints from tenants living in the flats he owns about poor living conditions and having deposits withheld.
Housing tribunal rulings have previously rejected arguments by these firms that they are operating short-term holiday lets from Mr Fortune's properties.
As a result the people living there should get the same protections as ordinary letting agreements.
According to the latest available list from the City of Edinburgh Council, there has been no application to put the flat that Mr Chen lived in on to the register of short term lets.
New laws in Scotland meant anyone operating a short term let had to apply for a licence to do so by October 2023 or face a Â£2,500 fine and a one year ban from letting.
BBC Scotland News can also reveal three flats belonging to Mr Fortune have been sold off to settle council tax debts - which are understood to be a sizable six-figure sum - with a further two properties due to be auctioned next month.
The flats were seized from him as part of a sequestration - the term used in Scottish Law for entering bankruptcy - started by the City of Edinburgh Council.
Mr Fortune supplied evidence to BBC Scotland News which he said showed he was at a dental surgery in France on the day Mr Chen's video was recorded.
The businessman said he was not a landlord and the properties he owns being run as holiday lets are operated by limited companies, not him personally.
Mr Fortune said he did not send any messages to Mr Chen and added he has reported Mr Chen to the police for allegedly writing slogans about him on the walls of his room before he left the flat for good.
He added: ""Mr Chen advised in November that he would not be paying rent as he was returning home, on inspection of the room after he left it was discovered he had vandalised the room.""
A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ""About 8.50pm on Friday, 25 October 2023, police were called to a report of a disturbance at premises in Gillespie Crescent, Edinburgh. Inquiries are ongoing.""

E3VQ78HF3D_NMAYJP4IJMMMW7D,Meek Mill apologises for filming a video in Ghana's presidential palace,By Mark Savage,10 January 2023,20231223,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64221544,"US rapper Meek Mill has apologised for surreptitiously filming a music video in Ghana's presidential palace, also known as Jubilee House.
The star caused uproar with the video, which saw him lip-syncing in the palace's corridors and halls - and even behind the presidential lectern.
He was accused of ""desecrating"" Jubilee House, while MPs raised questions about the potential security risks.
In a statement, Mill said he would ""take responsibility for my mistake"".
""To the people of Ghana, no video I drop is ever meant to disrespect the people of Ghana,"" he wrote.
""The fastest way to make connection is thru music [sic] and I wanted to do that with displaying art. I'm in my 30s from America and didn't know much about the lifestyle.""
He added that officials for Ghana's president, Nana Akufo-Addo, may not have been aware he was shooting a music video, saying the set-up had been ""a small camera and a kid"".
The president's office has not commented on the story; and Mill has removed his video from Instagram.

Mill, who was born Robert Rihmeek Williams in South Philadelphia, travelled to Ghana last month, after learning in an ancestry test that he was 18% Ghanaian.
He performed at the Afronation concert in Accra, rode dirt bikes in the city streets, and was later invited to see Jubilee House.
The footage he filmed during his visit was uploaded to Instagram on Sunday, provoking outrage in the West African nation.
""All those responsible for this despicable desecration of the Jubilee House by Meek Mill must be fired immediately,"" wrote Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, a member of parliament for the North Tongu district.
""How do those explicit lyrics from the president's lectern project Ghana positively? Is Ghana's seat of government no longer a high security installation?""

The MP, whose NDC party is in opposition to the President's National Patriotic Party, said he would call for an inquiry into the incident when Parliament returns from recess.
""We will insist that all those who masterminded this national disgrace and international embarrassment are brought to book,"" he told Accra's Joy FM radio station.
Ghana's former deputy Chief of Staff Alex Segbefia agreed that the video was ""unnecessary and is unacceptable in any shape or form"".
Social activist Julius Kwame Anthony added that ""seeing a foreign musician on the pulpit of the president"" was a ""shocking"" incident that ""is sinking our country to a new depth"".
""I do not think under any circumstance would it be allowed for a Ghanaian musician [like] Shatta Wale or Stormboy to be on the pulpit of the President of the United States. It would not happen"".
In his statement, Mill explained that he had simply been excited to share his experiences in Ghana with the world.

E3W679DLZR_ILOH4KEX0N5D37I,Pandemic puppy owners struggle with bad behaviour say vets,"By Jonathan Fagg, Lauren Woodhead & Emily Unia",7 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-67800895,"Dogs bought in the pandemic have high rates of problem behaviours, a Royal Veterinary College study suggests.
It estimates high rates of behaviours such as separation anxiety and aggression towards other dogs.
New owners are more likely to use punishment in training which risks worsening behaviour, the study's author warns.
Rescue charity Battersea says it has seen a rise in dogs with problem behaviours linked to the pandemic.
Denise Mariner-Chappell, 53, got her Labrador Ted in 2020. Due to lockdown measures, she said she struggled with ""the training and the socialising"".
""He's a crazy dog when he's out,"" she said.
""He's just manic. He just wants to play and sniff, and everything, but not with humans.""
Ms Mariner-Chappell, from near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, she said she had been verbally abused by other dog owners. One swore and shouted at her to ""get your dog away from my dog before I kick him round the field"".
Ted was not able to attend puppy classes during the pandemic, but was taken to a trainer afterwards.
Dr Rowena Packer, an author of the Royal Veterinary College's (RVC) study, said introducing puppies to people, other dogs and the world around them was ""potentially very important for their long-term mental and emotional well-being"".
She added ""puppies have a blueprint for the future based on just the first couple of months of their life"".
A Commons hearing earlier this year heard the UK's dog population rose by about a million to an estimated 11 million, with many people becoming first-time owners.
The RVC warned there was a boom in illegal puppy purchasing practices during the pandemic.
The number of cases where an out-of-control dog caused injury rose by just over a third between 2018 and 2022, a previous BBC investigation found. In January, a plastic surgeon in West Sussex told the BBC they were now seeing twice as many dog attack victims compared to before the pandemic.
Robert Bays, Battersea's senior animal behaviour manager, said the charity had seen a rise in dogs coming to its centres with behavioural issues, including ""separation anxiety, which can often be linked to the pandemic and the training challenges this unusual time presented"".
The RVC study, funded by Battersea, received 1,007 valid responses through an online survey of UK residents who got a dog during the first nine months of the pandemic.
On average, owners said their dogs had five behaviours they considered problems, while one in five said they had eight or more. The most common were pulling on the lead (67%), jumping up at people (57%) and not coming back when called (52%).
The study estimates almost a third of dogs had separation anxiety at 21 months.
Dr Packer warned owners struggling with problem behaviour - combined with the cost of living crisis - could lead to them ""reaching the end of their tether"" and rehoming their dogs.
She said in addition to the problematic behaviour recorded, some new owners struggled knowing what behaviour was normal for dogs.
Such behaviours ""are, in many cases, potentially being exacerbated by owners using punishment-based training techniques"", she said.
Four in five of those who participated in the study reported using aversive training methods, such as shouting, which vets said could increase fear and anxiety.
Dr Packer said although such behaviours could be frustrating for owners, ""they are often a sign a dog is struggling to cope or that they haven't been taught an appropriate response in a situation, rather than dogs intentionally behaving 'badly'"".
The most commonly used aversive training methods were moving the dog or shouting at them. Other owners reported using rattle bottles, water pistols and choke chains.
Only 18% of owners who took part in the survey used no aversive training methods or aids.
Mr Bays said he was concerned by the high levels of aversive methods highlighted by the study, adding: ""Without the right kind of positive training and support, a small behaviour problem in a puppy or dog can quickly escalate into a serious issue.
""This approach can often cause further behavioural problems in adulthood and lead to suppression of behaviour, not to mention significantly damage the relationship between pet and owner, which can be challenging to overcome in the future.""

E4WZW0G2FX_M4YRZAQY15895TD,Colin Firth to play Jim Swire in Lockerbie disaster series,_,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-68074033,"Oscar-winning actor Colin Firth is to play the part of Dr Jim Swire in a new series about the Lockerbie disaster.
It is based on Dr Swire's search for justice after his daughter died in the 1988 bombing which claimed 270 lives.
The five-part series entitled Lockerbie - to be shown on Sky - will begin production this year.
It is based, in part, on the book Dr Swire wrote with Peter Biddulph - The Lockerbie Bombing: A Father's Search for Justice.
He has been a prominent campaigner for justice since Pan Am flight 103 was brought down over the southern Scotland town more than 35 years ago.
Dr Swire has also questioned - and been part of efforts to appeal against - the conviction of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi for the bombing.
Al-Megrahi died in Tripoli in 2012 after being freed from a Scottish jail in 2009 on compassionate grounds because of cancer.
Dr Swire's part in the new series will be played by award-winning actor Colin Firth who has starred in the likes of The King's Speech, the Kingsman film series and Bridget Jones's Diary.
On 21 December 1988, all 259 people on board a jumbo jet heading to New York from London were killed.
Another 11 people died in Lockerbie when wreckage destroyed their homes.
Following the disaster, and his daughter's death, Dr Swire became a spokesperson for the UK victims' families in their search to find out what happened to their relatives.
Sky and Peacock Original, who are behind the new series, said it would look at his ""relentless journey"" which ""completely overturns his trust in the justice system"".
They said Firth would play the part of a ""a man, a husband, and a father who risks everything in memory of his daughter and the unflinching pursuit of truth and justice"".
Lockerbie bombing: The ultimate detective story?"
E5BT2SQ0ZM_VM9V8H947GZYD53,Khan Younis: UN says 12 killed at Gaza shelter as fighting rages,By David Gritten & Lipika Pelham,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68078580,"At least 12 people were killed and 75 injured when a UN facility sheltering civilians was struck in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, the UN's Palestinian refugee agency says.
UNRWA said two shells hit its Khan Younis Training Centre during fighting in the city's western outskirts.
Its commissioner condemned the ""blatant disregard of basic rules of war"".
Israel's military said it had ruled out that the incident was the result of an air or artillery strike by its forces.
It added that it was reviewing Israeli operations nearby and examining the possibility that it was ""Hamas fire"".
Israeli troops have been battling Hamas fighters as they advance into western Khan Younis, a day after the military said it had completely encircled the city.
Clashes and bombardment around the city's two main hospitals have also left thousands of patients, staff and others unable to leave.
The conflict was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,300 people were killed and about 250 others taken hostage.
More than 25,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
An estimated 1.7 million people - nearly three-quarters of the population - have also been displaced by the past 12 weeks of fighting and many of them are sheltering inside UN facilities or near them.
The Khan Younis Training Centre is one of the largest UNRWA shelters, with between 30,000 and 40,000 people said to be living inside its grounds.
UNRWA said the compound was clearly marked, that its co-ordinates had been shared with Israeli authorities, and that it and the civilians inside had to be protected under international law.
However, at least six displaced people were killed and many more injured when the training centre was struck on Monday during intense fighting in the surrounding area, according to the agency.
On Wednesday afternoon, UNRWA's Gaza director, Thomas White, said a building at the facility that was housing 800 people from northern Gaza was hit.
In an interview with the BBC from Rafah in the evening, he said the building was struck by ""two tank rounds"" and that at least nine people were killed.
On Thursday morning, Mr White issued a statement saying the building was ""hit by two shells and caught fire"". Twelve people had now been confirmed dead and 15 of the injured were in a critical condition, he added.
""A number of missions to assess the situation were denied. Yesterday evening, the UN finally managed to reach the affected areas to treat trauma patients, bring medical supplies and evacuate injured patients to Rafah.""
He added: ""The situation in Khan Younis underscores a consistent failure to uphold the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law: distinction, proportionality and precautions in carrying out attacks. This is unacceptable and abhorrent and must stop.""
In response to UNRWA's initial reports, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: ""After an examination of our operational systems, the IDF has currently ruled out that this incident is a result of an aerial or artillery strike by the IDF.""
""A thorough review of the operations of the forces in the vicinity is under way,"" it added. ""The IDF is also examining the possibility that the strike was a result of Hamas fire.""
Vedant Patel of the US state department repeated Washington's calls for the protection of civilians in Gaza.
""We deplore today's attack on the UN's Khan Younis training centre,"" she said, and called it ""incredibly concerning"".
The IDF also said on Wednesday afternoon that its troops had ""launched a divisional manoeuvre on West Khan Younis"" that was targeting Hamas ""outposts, infrastructure, and command and control centres"".
""Dismantling Hamas' military framework in western Khan Yunis is the heart of the logic behind the operation.""
The IDF added that Hamas ""exploits the civilian population, exploits shelters and hospitals"" - something the group has denied.
Gaza's health ministry meanwhile accused the IDF of ""isolating hospitals in Khan Younis and carrying out massacres in the western area of the city"".
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said the al-Amal Hospital, which it runs, and its local headquarters were under ""siege"" by Israeli forces, trapping patients, wounded people and an estimated 13,000 displaced people.
The organisation alleged that three displaced people were killed after being targeted at the entrance to the headquarters on Wednesday morning.
MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) warned on Tuesday night that its staff inside the nearby Nasser Medical Complex - the largest hospital still partly functioning in Gaza - had reported bombing and heavy gunfire nearby.
""They are currently unable to evacuate along with the thousands of people in the hospital, including 850 patients, due to roads to and from the building being either inaccessible or too dangerous.""
The IDF has issued evacuation orders for western parts of Khan Younis, including those where Nasser and al-Amal are located. The UN estimates there are about 88,000 residents and 425,000 displaced people in the area.
Mr White told the BBC that tens of thousands more people were now on the move, heading south to Rafah, on the border with Egypt, where as many as 1.4 million are already sheltering.
In another incident in Khan Younis on Tuesday, a cameraman for the UK's ITV News filmed a Palestinian civilian being shot dead on a main road about 1.7km (1 mile) south of the UNRWA shelter.
Five men are seen walking towards the combat zone holding a white flag, before there is a burst of gunfire and one of them falls to the ground. It was not clear who opened fire.
UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was asked in the Parliament on Wednesday whether such pictures would prompt him to push for a ceasefire in Gaza.
He replied: ""No-one wants to see this conflict go on for a moment longer than is necessary and we do want to see an immediate and sustained humanitarian pause.""
Efforts involving several countries to try to reach a ceasefire are ongoing, with one plan said to include a month-long truce and phased release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.
But both Israel and Hamas appear to have rejected proposals, and hopes of any progress have been dampened.
Egypt's President, Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, meanwhile accused Israel of deliberately holding up aid deliveries at the Egyptian-controlled Rafah border crossing as ""a form of pressure on the Gaza Strip and its people over the conflict and the release of hostages"".
However, an Israeli defence ministry agency co-ordinating the deliveries with Egypt and the UN rejected the claim, insisting that ""there is no limit to the amount of aid that can enter Gaza"".

EC08LUK5WH_AQ5NCXCEMMHBHUY,'Covid-cure' preacher's church stripped of charitable status,By Guy Lynn,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-68095890,"A preacher who was exposed by the BBC for selling Â£91 ""divine plague protection kits"" as a cure for Covid-19 has been sanctioned by the Charity Commission.
Bishop Climate Wiseman, of Kingdom Church, Camberwell, warned people they would ""drop dead"" if they did not buy the kits.
He was convicted of fraud and given a one-year suspended jail term last year.
The commission has now shut down his Kingdom Church GB charity.
Wiseman, 47, has also been disqualified from being a charity trustee for 15 years.
""The public rightly expects charities to be places of safety,"" said Helen Earner, director of regulatory services at the commission.
""Trustee Bishop Climate Wiseman fell woefully short of that expectation when he scammed vulnerable people at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.
""The Charity Commission acted robustly to investigate the charity and its governance, and ultimately concluded that the Kingdom Church GB should be wound up and removed from the charity register.""
Wiseman offered a package containing a small bottle of hyssop, cedarwood and olive oil along with a prayer card and piece of scarlet yarn.
Undercover researchers for BBC London purchased the items, the sale of which constituted the basis of the resulting fraud investigation by Southwark Council.
Wiseman claimed anyone who purchased the kits would be protected from the virus and would have no need for social distancing. It is thought he sold the kits to thousands of people.
Evidence against him during his trial included secret phone recordings and testimony from the BBC investigation team, who received a confidential tip-off that the church was selling the kits.
Wiseman, who denied fraud and two alternative counts under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations, was found guilty by a jury in December 2022 of the more serious offence of fraud.

Undercover footage shows a surgeon telling a reporter she could qualify for gastric sleeve surgery if she ate more
The General Medical Council  is to alert Turkey over concerns about a bariatric surgeon selling weight-loss ""holidays"" to UK patients.
Turkish doctor, OgÃ¼n ErÅen, advised a BBC undercover journalist to gain weight so she could qualify for weight-loss surgery abroad.
At an Ekol Hospitals sales day in Glasgow he told her to ""eat snacks"" to increase her body mass index (BMI).
The reporter had a BMI of 24.4, which is within the healthy weight range.
She gave the weight-loss clinic information which would have meant her BMI was 29 but she was not weighed during her consultation.
In secret footage recorded and broadcast in a BBC Disclosure documentary about the weight-loss industry, Dr ErÅen told the reporter she could have a gastric sleeve operation in three months, adding: ""You must eat, eat. Eat something and reach 30"".
A spokesman for the General Medical Council (GMC), said: ""We intend to contact the Turkish Ministry of Health to make them aware of the individual's conduct in the documentary so they can consider this.""
Ekol Hospitals is holding similar sales days in Newcastle, Manchester and Leeds over the coming days.
A leading bariatric surgeon in the UK described the consultation as ""utterly indefensible"".
Omar Khan, chairman of the National Bariatric Surgery Registry, highlighted the risks of the irreversible surgery and said it should not be carried out if it is not needed.
""I have major concerns,"" he said.
""It seems that he's almost pushing the patient to hit the target so that they can do the surgery, and that's completely unethical.""
The GMC, which regulates the licensing, registration and professional standards of doctors and medical specialists in the UK, confirmed that Dr ErÅen was not registered to practice in the UK.
A spokesman said: ""Any doctor who wants to carry out an activity from the UK for which a medical licence is needed has a legal requirement to be registered with a licence to practise.
""If an unregistered doctor visits the UK to provide general information about a clinic abroad, the cosmetic interventions available, costs and arrangements for travel, they would not legally need to be registered and licensed as long as they are not carrying out privileged activities, as set out in legislation.
""Doctors must be clear whether they are licensed, hold registration only, or neither.""
Healthcare Improvement Scotland also warned patients considering weight-loss surgery against seeking advice from doctors and hospitals that are not registered in the UK.
A spokesman said: ""We would urge anyone considering treatments in the private sector to carefully consider the risks and benefits and choose a private healthcare service that is regulated in the UK.
""It is crucial that we provide assurances for the public that these treatments and procedures are carried out in safe and regulated environments.
""However, we are only able to regulate and inspect private hospitals and private clinics providing treatments within Scotland, and where the healthcare professionals are registered to practice in the UK.""
Bariatric surgery, also known as weight-loss surgery, is used by the NHS as a last resort to treat people who are dangerously obese (having a body mass index of 40 or above, or 35 plus other obesity-related health conditions).
Patients must have tried, and failed, to achieve clinically-beneficial weight loss by all other appropriate non-surgical methods, and be fit for surgery.
The two most common types of weight-loss surgery are:
Ekol Hospitals is one of the many Turkish companies targeting British customers with adverts for surgery abroad.
It denied that it accepted patients for surgery who do not meet international guidelines or criteria.
In a statement, Ekol Hospitals said: ""We have obtained all international accreditations and possess advanced, state-of-the-art medical equipment.
""Extensive checks are conducted from initial contact with prospective patients, and certainly prior to any surgery taking place, to ensure that the patient is suitable.
""Whilst at the hospital, a full and extensive health check is completed.""
The price to have the surgery privately in the UK is between Â£10,000 and Â£15,000 but it can cost as little as Â£2,000 to book weight-loss surgery in Europe.
There have been a number of deaths as a result of British people travelling abroad for bariatric surgery since 2019, as well as more than half a dozen patients left requiring the use of a feeding tube.
In a study of five London hospitals over the course of 2022, 35 patients who had recently had weight-loss surgery abroad had to have emergency medical intervention.
Undercover filming revealed the company holding consultations with patients whose BMI did not meet the requirement for bariatric surgery, and with a medical condition that should have raised red flags.
BMI is based on a person's height and weight; it is one of the main factors when assessing for bariatric surgery.
A patient with a BMI of less than 40, and no severe co-morbidities relating to obesity, would typically be rejected for weight-loss surgery in the UK.
Under the international IFSO guidelines the threshold is lower, at 35.

The National Lottery Community Fund is launching a Â£5m Sustainable Community Buildings programme.
The funds are issued for improvements like solar panels, insulation and heat pumps.
The resulting savings could allow groups to put more of their resources into their activities, rather than paying increasing energy bills.
The Fund's NI director Kate Beggs said it was part of a new strategy to support communities to be environmentally sustainable and increase awareness of environmental challenges.
Organisations applying to the programme will get free carbon literacy training to help them understand how to reduce their carbon footprint.
They will also get access to experts to help them write an environmental plan to improve sustainability and cut costs.
A number of groups have already made similar changes and say there are many benefits.
The support service Cancer Lifeline received a sustainability grant more 10 ten years ago.
While the environment is not the focus of the group, Liddean McStravog said putting in solar panels had helped them save Â£1,000 a year - equivalent to five people getting help through counselling.
""Savings are directed to vital support services that are making a real difference to people's lives,"" Ms McStravog said.
""Our message to other community projects is, don't shy away.â¯
""You don't have to be experts, just willing to embrace ways of becoming more sustainable and saving money along the way.
""A clear win/win, for all.""â¯
The new funding programme will open in stages, with organisations in Ards and North Down, Armagh City Banbridge and Craigavon, Mid Ulster, and Newry Mourne and Down council areas eligible to apply from 7 February.

EPHRYBS77X_Y1Z27Y8MGREBVTO,Peter Navarro: Ex-Trump adviser sentenced for contempt of Congress,By Max Matza,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68086757,"This video can not be played
Watch: Ex-Trump trade adviser speaks after prison sentence
Peter Navarro, former trade adviser to Donald Trump, has been sentenced to four months in prison and a $9,500 (Â£7,500) fine for contempt of Congress.
Navarro was convicted in September after he ignored a subpoena from a House committee investigating alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
Federal prosecutors said he ""chose allegiance to former President Donald Trump over the rule of law"".
Navarro has filed an appeal and vowed to take the case to the Supreme Court.
Prosecutors had asked that Navarro, 74, serve a six-month sentence. His lawyers claimed he was ""not an insurrectionist"" and requested that he serve no jail time.
Navarro was served with a subpoena by a US House of Representatives select committee in February 2022.
But he did not hand over any of the requested emails or documents or appear to testify before the Democratic-led panel.
When contacted by the committee, Navarro said Mr Trump had instructed him to cite executive privilege. This is a legal principle that allows certain White House communications to be kept under private.
But the judge ruled that there was no evidence that Mr Trump could have requested that, or that executive privilege could have permitted Navarro to ignore the committee's summons.
He was found guilty by the 12-member jury after four hours of deliberations, following a trial in Washington DC last year that lasted two days.
Addressing the court on Thursday, Judge Amit Mehta said he had a ""great deal of respect"" for Navarro, adding that it is ""disappointing how he behaved"".
""It's those kinds of statements from somebody who knows better â¦ that contribute to why our politics are so corrosive. It is regrettable.""
The judge also noted the work Navarro did with US businesses to speed up production of Covid-19 protective equipment during the pandemic, saying ""I do think the country owes you a debt of gratitude to you for your work with the coronavirus"".
In his 2021 book, In Trump Time, Navarro said he was the architect of a strategy to challenge the 2020 election results, claiming widespread voter fraud.
The plan was for congressional Republicans to delay certification of President Joe Biden's victory.
The House committee said Navarro's claims of massive ballot fraud had been exposed as baseless by state and local officials.
Navarro, addressing the judge, said he was ""disappointed"" that he was not permitted to raise an executive privilege defence.
""The minute that violence erupted on Capitol Hill was one of the worst moments of my life,"" he said.
Judge Mehta said that Navarro's actions sought to thwart ""a significant effort by Congress to get to the bottom of a terrible day in the country's history"".
""They had a job to do and you made it harder. It is really that simple,"" he added.
Navarro, speaking to reporters after his sentencing, said he was ""caught in a battle between two competing branches of government"", referring to Congress and the White House.
He called his case ""destined for the Supreme Court"", saying it should decide ""whether a senior White House aide and alter ego of the president can be compelled to testify by Congress"".
His case has parallels with another Trump aide who was convicted of defying the 6 January committee.
Former Trump campaign strategist Steve Bannon was convicted of two counts of contempt for refusing the House committee's legal summons in July 2022.
Bannon was also sentenced to four months in jail, but has remained free while his defence team appeals against the conviction.

ET1LSQXHCW_POC1MAFY5Q48EI5,Four guilty of violent disorder over Suites Hotel asylum clash,By Andy Gill & Phil Cooper,6 days ago,20230122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-68055264,"Four men have been found guilty of violent disorder after trouble flared at a hotel housing asylum seekers.
Violence broke out outside the Suites Hotel in Knowsley, Merseyside, last year which was providing temporary accommodation for asylum seekers.
A large group had gathered and rocks and fireworks were thrown at police.
Brian McPadden, 61, Thomas Mills, 47, Paul Lafferty, 42 and Jonjo O'Donoghue, 21 were convicted after a jury returned unanimous verdicts.
The four defendants, all from Kirkby apart from O'Donoghue, of Liverpool city centre, had admitted being present on the night but denied violent disorder.
A fifth man, Daniel Fulham, 39, was cleared at Liverpool Crown Court of violent disorder and abusive or threatening behaviour.
Three police officers were injured in the disorder on 10 February last year, after the court heard there was ""ill feeling"" in the area following a video on social media which appeared to show an asylum seeker asking a 15-year-old girl for her phone number and for a kiss.
There were tears and swearing from people in the public gallery as the verdicts were announced.
Mills collapsed in the dock shortly after he was convicted.
The four men found guilty will be sentenced at a later date, along with others who have already been convicted for their part in the violence.
The jury was told social media posts were made about the planned demonstration and leaflets were delivered.
On the Friday evening, members of a right-wing group and a left-wing group gathered outside the hotel.
Det Con David Williams told the court at about 19:00 GMT a large group of people arrived at the scene on foot.
He said: ""At that time it seemed that tensions changed somewhat.""
Footage showed crowds chanting ""get them out"" and throwing fireworks at a cordon of police officers, as a police van burned.
Rocks and paving slabs were also thrown, with one police officer needing hospital treatment and another two suffering less serious injuries.
Mills could be seen in footage standing on top of the van before it was set alight and holding a banner which said: ""Let's shout, get them out.""
McPadden was heard in the footage saying: ""We protect our own, youse are not from Kirkby, we are.""
There was no evidence that any of the defendants were members of a far-right group.
Five other men pleaded guilty to violent disorder at earlier hearings.
Seven youths, aged between 13 and 17, have been sentenced after they admitted violent disorder.
Six were given referral orders and one was fined.
Jared Skeete, 19, was sentenced to three years' detention last April after he pleaded guilty to violent disorder, having thrown fireworks and snorted ketamine while shouting abuse at police.
Three women - Cheryl Nicholls, 44, Nicola Elliott, 52, and Jennifer Knox, 41 - were found not guilty of violent disorder halfway through the trial following a direction to the jury from judge Denis Watson KC, who said there was ""insufficient evidence"".

EZT74KKRN3_T265TU4MJHWAJ64,Qatar 'appalled' by reported criticism from Israel's Netanyahu,By David Gritten,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68091659,"Qatar has said it is ""appalled"" by remarks attributed to Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in which he apparently called its role as a mediator in the Gaza war ""problematic"".
Israeli TV broadcast what it said was a recording of Mr Netanyahu telling the families of hostages held by Hamas that ""you don't hear me thanking Qatar"".
""They have leverage... because they finance [Hamas],"" he reportedly adds.
Qatar said the comments, if true, were ""irresponsible"" but ""not surprising"".
The tiny Gulf emirate has had high-level contacts with Israel since the 1990s, but they have never officially established diplomatic relations.
Qatar has long championed the Palestinian cause and hosts political leaders of Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, the US and other countries.
It is has also provided hundreds of millions of dollars of aid for Gaza, which has been subject to a crippling blockade by Israel and Egypt since 2006, when Hamas won legislative elections. The blockade was tightened the following year when Hamas reinforced its power in Gaza by violently ousting Palestinian Authority (PA) forces.
Since 2018, Israeli governments have allowed Qatar to pay the wages of tens of thousands of civil servants in Gaza's Hamas-run government, financially support the poorest families, and fund fuel deliveries for the territory's sole power plant. Qatar insists the funding was only for civilian and humanitarian purposes.
The policy sparked controversy within Israel, with critics warning it was helping Hamas to stay in power and fund its military activities.
Mr Netanyahu - who has been re-elected to office for all but one of the past 15 years - said it was a way to dissuade attacks on Israel and prevent a humanitarian disaster in Gaza.
Following the cross-border attacks on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,300 people were killed and 250 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages, he dismissed as a ""big lie"" accusations that he had also encouraged the payments in order to strengthen Hamas at the expense of the PA.
Israel responded to the attacks by launching a large-scale military campaign in Gaza with the aim of destroying Hamas. More than 25,000 people have been killed in the fighting, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Qatar used its ties with Hamas to help broker a week-long pause in the fighting in late November, during which 105 Israeli and foreign hostages were freed in exchange for some 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
The emirate has for weeks been trying to broker a new ceasefire, with Gaza's humanitarian crisis worsening and with the Israeli government coming under mounting domestic pressure to secure the release of the remaining hostages.
On Tuesday, Israel's Channel 12 TV released what it said was a recording of Mr Netanyahu telling hostages' families: ""You don't hear me thanking Qatar. Have you noticed?""
""Why? Because for me it is essentially no different from the UN or Red Cross, and in a certain sense is even more problematic - I have no illusions about them.""
""But I'm ready to use any actor right now that helps me bring [the hostages] home,"" he added.
Israel has accused the UN and Red Cross of not doing enough to support the hostages or to help get them freed.
The prime minister purportedly said the reason Qatar could help was because of ""leverage"" over Hamas.
""Why do they have leverage? Because they finance them.""
On Wednesday night, Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari wrote on X, formerly Twitter: ""These remarks if validated, are irresponsible and destructive to the efforts to save innocent lives, but are not surprising.""
""For months, and following a successful mediation last year that led to the release of more than 100 hostages, Qatar has been engaged in regular dialogue with the negotiating parties including Israeli institutions, attempting to establish the framework for a new hostage agreement and the immediate entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza.""
He added that Mr Netanyahu appeared to be undermining the mediation efforts ""for reasons that appear to serve his political career"".
In response, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich wrote on X: ""Qatar is a country that supports and finances terrorism. It is Hamas's patron and is largely responsible for the massacre of Israeli citizens by Hamas.""
""One thing is certain: Qatar will not have one iota of involvement in Gaza on the day after the war,"" he added.
There was no immediate comment from Qatar's foreign ministry.
Meanwhile US President Biden is sending the director of the CIA to try to broker a new deal on hostages held in Gaza, the BBC's US partner CBS has confirmed.
William Burns will meet the Qatari PM and directors of Mossad, Israel's secret service, in France.

F0KRI6YQYK_5H41S0OIVL92VNQ,Adani Ports: The Tamil Nadu villagers taking on a billionaire's port plan,By K Subagunam,5 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-67942639,"Thousands of villagers in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu are fighting a proposal to expand a port owned by billionaire Gautam Adani, one of the world's richest men.
The villagers, most of whom make a living through fishing, say the port expansion in Kattupalli - a small village located in Tiruvallur district along the Bay of Bengal coast - would submerge their lands and wreak havoc on their livelihoods. Adani Ports denies this.
The 330-acre multi-purpose port - originally built by Indian conglomerate Larson & Toubro (L&T) - was acquired by Adani Ports in 2018.
The company later proposed to expand it more than 18-fold to an area of 6,110 acres by claiming portions of land along the coast.
According to the company's master plan, the expansion would increase the port's cargo capacity from 24.6 metric tonnes to 320 metric tonnes per year and develop new rail and road networks that would boost trade connectivity in the region.
But fisher people in at least 100 towns and villages located on the coast say this would gravely impact their work. ""The number of fish varieties found here has already gone down significantly. Any kind of expansion would further deplete its population,"" claims Rajalakshmi, a fisherwoman from the region.
The expansion has met with resistance from environmentalists as well, who claim the plan would lead to massive coastal erosion and a loss of biodiversity, especially of the indigenous fish species and the crabs, prawns and small turtles found in the region.
Environmentalist Meera Shah claims it could also ""destroy"" Pulicat lake, the second-largest saltwater lake in the country.
At the moment, the coastal stretch acts as a barrier between the lake and the Bay of Bengal. But the region has been experiencing widespread environmental pollution and coastal erosion in recent years, Mr Shah added.
If more construction is undertaken here, the coast would shrink further, ""leading the lake and the sea to merge"".
A spokesperson from Adani Port, however, rejected the allegations and called them ""misplaced"".
A senior company official, who wanted to stay anonymous, told BBC Tamil that locals ""are not against the expansion of the port"" and alleged the protests were being led by people ""with ulterior motives for publicity"".
""Individuals opposed to the expansion do not base their claims on any primary data. Some good NGOs involved in protecting the environment may have some genuine questions, which will be addressed during the [mandatory] environmental clearance process,"" the official added.
Protests against the port expansion first broke out in 2018 and have continued intermittently over the years.
The agitation intensified again in September, when the state government started the process of giving environmental clearance to the project, paving the way for the expansion work to begin.
In the same month, the state's Pollution Control Board was forced to postpone a mandatory public hearing for the project amid strong protests.
According to the master plan, of the 6,110 acres needed for the expansion, 2,000 acres would be acquired from the sea, while the remaining land would be taken from the coastal area.
The company says it will reclaim parts of the sea by filling it with sand and include them in the port area. It also plans to deepen a portion of the sea and create a sea wall around it so that more ships can move along the coast.
Experts warn this could have devastating consequences for the region's ecology.
The east coast of India - and the Tamil Nadu coast in particular - does not have the geographical landscape suitable for port construction, let alone an expansion, claims Dr Ilango Lakshmanan, a professor of hydrogeology at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras.
""This would disrupt the coastal topography and lead to more sea erosion,"" he added.
A senior company spokesperson rejected the claim and said that sea erosion in the region could not be linked to the port's construction alone.
""States like Gujarat and Maharashtra, where some of the major ports in the country are located, have lower rates of sea erosion compared to the east coast,"" the spokesperson said.
But some industry experts also say the expansion plan should not be dismissed entirely as it would benefit the state's economy and bring more employment.
""Kattupalli port was facing losses and started making profits only after the Adani takeover. An expansion would bring in more ships, which, in turn, will increase its economic scale,"" Valliappan Nagappan, the former president of Hindustan Chamber of Commerce, an independent trade organisation, said.
""However, the company must ensure that locals are well-compensated and relocated [if required] properly, without any impact on their livelihoods,"" Mr Nagappan added.
But protesters say they are not convinced.
""We are ready to face anything in our fight against the project. Our livelihoods should be protected at all costs,"" Vijaya, a fisherwoman from Pulicat, said.
Protesters blame the Tamil Nadu government for not doing enough to safeguard their interests.
Many claim that before the state elections, Chief Minister MK Stalin repeatedly promised he would scrap the expansion plan, but nothing has happened since he came to power in 2021. The BBC has reached out to the chief minister's office and the state's environment minister for comment.
This is not the first time that a port run by Adani Ports has invited protests.
In 2022, massive protests erupted in the fishing villages of the neighbouring state of Kerala against the construction of a port managed by the company in partnership with the local government.
The protest was later called off in December after the state government promised to pay each of those who were to be displaced a monthly compensation.
At Kattupalli, port authorities have been wooing the local community by offering them free medical aid and promising them jobs.
""We are in touch with the villagers and communities around the port area and they are very much interested in the project and getting jobs,"" the unnamed Adani Ports senior executive cited above said.
The protesters, however, say that they are being cautious.
""If they want to give us medicines and take our land, we will not let it happen,"" one of them said.

F13FDLUJ42_BA7BP1N6O7TM9OT,"Nicola Sturgeon called Boris Johnson a 'clown', inquiry hears",By Angus Cochrane,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-68092654,"This video can not be played
Junior counsel to the inquiry Usman Tariq read out a text conversation between Nicola Sturgeon and Liz Lloyd about Boris Johnson
Nicola Sturgeon called Boris Johnson a ""clown"" in an expletive-laden text conversation with her chief of staff, the UK Covid Inquiry has heard.
The inquiry was shown messages in which the former first minister described as ""excruciating"" a Downing Street announcement about a second Covid lockdown in England.
Ms Sturgeon said she was offended by Mr Johnson's ""utter incompetence"".
Her former aide said the language showed Ms Sturgeon's ""frustration"".
Mr Johnson, who was prime minister during the pandemic, has said he had a ""friendly"" relationship with Ms Sturgeon.
It came as First Minister Humza Yousaf, who also gave evidence to the inquiry on Thursday, announced an externally-led review into the Scottish government's use of mobile messaging apps, conceding that there are ""challenges"" in relation to how the app is used in government.
He conceded that the handling of requests for WhatsApp messages had not been the government's ""finest hour"" and had not given bereaved families confidence.
Liz Lloyd, who served as chief of staff and a strategic adviser to Ms Sturgeon between 2015 and 2023, said engagement with Mr Johnson became ""pointless"" in the early months of the pandemic.
Speaking at the inquiry - which is currently sitting in Edinburgh - she was shown messages from 31 October 2020 between her and Ms Sturgeon on the same evening as Mr Johnson announced a fresh lockdown for England.
Ms Sturgeon said his address to the nation was ""(expletive) excruciating"" and that the UK government's communications were ""awful"".
She told Ms Lloyd: ""His utter incompetence in every sense is now offending me on behalf of politicians everywhere.""
Ms Lloyd then said she was ""offended"" on behalf of all special advisers to which Ms Sturgeon replied: ""He is a (expletive) clown.""
Ms Lloyd told the inquiry the conversation was the result of ""chaos"" in the UK government.
She said the Scottish government had to ""mitigate"" that because although the restrictions did not apply in Scotland, they had an effect on how people north of the border viewed the pandemic.
""We were clearly not very complimentary about their communications handling that day,"" she told the inquiry.
Asked if the relationship between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Johnson had broken down, Ms Lloyd replied: ""I think broken down to a degree overstates what was there to break.""
She said there was a ""politeness"" when the the two leaders had previously met but the relationship became ""much harder"" during the pandemic.
Ms Lloyd claimed it was evident during talks with devolved leaders that Mr Johnson ""didn't want to be on those calls, he wasn't necessarily well briefed on those calls and he wasn't listening to the points we were making on those calls"".
""I think engagement with him came to be seen as slightly pointless during this period,"" she added.
The inquiry heard that as early as March 2020 Ms Lloyd had described Cobra, the UK government's emergency response committee, as a ""shambles"".
She said in broader terms there was better communication between the two governments, particularly on health, but that discussions with the prime minister ""didn't get us anywhere"".
Mr Johnson was quizzed about his relationship with Ms Sturgeon when he appeared in front of the Covid inquiry in December.
""When I have talked to her, we have got on very well and had a friendly relationship,"" he said.
The inquiry also heard that Ms Lloyd told Ms Sturgeon  in WhatsApp messages that she wanted a ""good old-fashioned rammy"" with the UK government so she could ""think about something other than sick people"".
Ms Lloyd told Ms Sturgeon she had ""set a timetable"" for the UK government to answer the Scottish government on furlough as a ""purely political"" move in the messages between herself and the former first minister on 1 November 2020.
Ms Sturgeon said: ""Yeah, I get it. And it might be worth doing. I've sent a rough formulation of what I might say tomorrow.""
Ms Sturgeon is expected to give evidence to the inquiry next week.
The tight relationship between Liz Lloyd and Nicola Sturgeon is reflected in the blunt language Ms Sturgeon used in a message to her then chief of staff, describing Boris Johnson as a clown.
No one in the SNP will be bothered about that â it's not far from the former first minister's publicly-expressed view.
There are though thornier questions for Ms Sturgeon about her style of government.
Was it too tightly controlled? Would better decisions have been taken if dissent had actually been encouraged? Why were private mobile devices used for public business? And should better records have been kept?
The answer to that last one is yes, according to the current first minister, adding to the pressure on his predecessor.
Another theme of the hearings in Edinburgh has been the constitution.
The Scottish government is accused of focusing on independence rather than tackling the virus.
Ms Lloyd and others say that is grossly unfair â although they do argue that a lack of powers over Scotland's finances and external borders hampered their ability to respond.
Ms Lloyd was the first Scottish government figure to submit WhatsApp messages to the inquiry in July 2023.
She said she was not aware to the best of her recollection of a government mobile messaging policy introduced in 2021 which suggested some messages should be wiped every month.
The former special adviser added she did not think she would have deleted information that could be subject to a freedom of information request even if she had knowledge of the policy.
Last week, counsel to the inquiry, Jamie Dawson KC, said Ms Sturgeon appeared to ""have retained no messages whatsoever"".
On Sunday, Ms Sturgeon said copies of some of her messages had been retrieved and were handed to the inquiry last year.
Earlier this week, the inquiry was told Ms Sturgeon provided a public health expert with an SNP email address where she said she could be contacted ""privately"" alongside her official email during a discussion around a briefing paper.
It has also been revealed Chief Medical Officer Gregor Smith and National Clinical Director Jason Leitch regularly deleted WhatsApps during the pandemic, and encouraged others to do so.
They both said they were following Scottish government policy and that records about decision making were properly archived.
The inquiry was also shown a document from the cabinet showing priorities for preparations going forward in July 2020, stating that each portfolio should prepare for the combined effects of Covid-19 and the transition period, and agree that consideration should be given to ""restarting work on independence"".
Inquiry chair Lady Hallett said: ""It does look a bit like the politicisation of the coronavirus pandemic, doesn't it?""
Ms Lloyd replied it was not her ""understanding"" that the government was not seeking to politicise the situation ""at that time"".
Lady Hallett suggested it looked like some members of cabinet agreed to ""capitalise on the pandemic to advance cause of independence"".
Ms Lloyd said: ""It says consideration was given to this but was not done at this time.""
Speaking at the inquiry later on Thursday, Mr Yousaf described his government's handling of inquiry requests as ""frankly poor"" and offered an apology.

Humza Yousaf said Nicola Sturgeon liked to keep a âtighter cast listâ when making some Covid decisions
The first minister - who initially served as justice secretary during the pandemic, before becoming between health secretary in May 2021 - said there were times that calls made by his predecessor Ms Sturgeon were not ""cascaded"" to all ministers and there were times when she wanted a ""tighter cast list"" for decision-making.
In messages between Mr Yousaf and Prof Leitch on 20 May, 2021, the adviser said: ""There was some first minister 'keep it small' shenanigans as always.""
Seemingly referring to decision making, the national clinical director said: ""She actually wants none of us.""
Mr Yousaf told the inquiry: ""I don't doubt of course there were times the former first minister needed a tighter cast list and wanted one.
""I think this is a classic example of Jason perhaps over-speaking.""
Mr Yousaf also said he used his own personal phones to conduct official business during the course of the pandemic.
Mr Yousaf told the inquiry in October that his messages had not been retained, but he later recovered them from an old phone, the inquiry heard.
The inquiry was later shown messages from 19 June 2020 between Mr Yousaf and then deputy first minister John Swinney in which Mr Yousaf described the Scottish Police Federation (SPF) as a ""disgrace"".
""Right through this pandemic they have shown an arrogance and retrograde thinking,"" he added, claiming that the then Police Scotland Chief Constable Iain Livingstone ""was livid last night"".
Mr Yousaf told the inquiry: ""Sometimes when you are venting those private conversations to a colleague you use language that you regret.""
He said he had a ""good relationship"" the SPF but that he did ""not always get along"" with its previous leadership.
He accused the SPF of not being ""supportive"" of officers in enforcing Covid rules, adding: ""I thought the way they articulated that was deeply, deeply unhelpful.""
Mr Yousaf said he had the ""greatest amount of respect"" for individual officers, who he described as ""absolutely integral to public health efforts"".

FALE1ADVR8_3ANJZ5JTBJD6ATP,'I just love you': Tim Scott and Donald Trump's other challengers fall in line,By Phil McCausland,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68077091,"This video can not be played
Watch: Trump rivals line up to back him after New Hampshire
Donald Trump shared the stage at his New Hampshire victory party on Tuesday night with a team of former rivals and young conservative stars.
Tim Scott and Vivek Ramaswamy, who ran against and criticised Mr Trump just months ago, served as headliners.
Speculation has grown that they may seek future White House posts - and many have suggested Mr Scott could even be a potential running mate.
Still, Mr Trump introduced the men by taking a couple of jabs at them.
He introduced Mr Ramaswamy and said he would only allow him to speak ""if he promised to do it in a minute or less"". This was likely a dig at the biotech entrepreneur's numerous loquacious moments on the Republican debate stage.
In a moment that drew more attention and a slightly awkward silence at the watch party, Mr Trump suggested that Mr Scott ""must really hate"" Nikki Haley, since the former South Carolina governor appointed him to his Senate seat in 2013.
Mr Scott moved quickly in a bid to salvage the moment by stepping to the lectern, grinning widely and shouting: ""I just love you!""
Though their presence appeared to re-emphasise their endorsement of him and illustrate a united Republican front, the former president's comments towards his colleagues attracted attention online.
Pundits have characterised the moments as politically cruel and reminiscent of Mr Trump's poor treatment of past surrogates.
Many have drawn parallels to Mr Trump's treatment of former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Texas Senator Ted Cruz - both men challenged the former president in the 2016 election cycle before ultimately endorsing him.
At the time, Mr Trump made jokes at both men's expense despite their support and often forced them to stand by his side, leading to numerous embarrassing internet memes from their time campaigning for him.
Despite the awkward moments after the New Hampshire primary, Mr Scott appeared on numerous news shows on Wednesday morning to make his pitch for Mr Trump. He declined, however, to speak to his future ambitions in a possible Trump White House.
""The only conversation I've had with the president about being vice-president was that I'll never ask you to be a vice-president,"" he said on CBS Mornings on Wednesday. ""I'll never ask you to be a part of your cabinet.""
Unlike Mr Scott, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis - another former rival for the Republican nomination who then endorsed the former president - appears uninterested in joining the surrogate line.
Since leaving the race shortly after the Iowa caucus, Mr DeSantis has backed Mr Trump but also noted the candidate's many vulnerabilities. He said there was a clear enthusiasm problem among Republican voters, who he said are slow to back the former president.
""When I have people come up to me who voted for Reagan in '76 and have been conservative their whole life say that they don't want to vote for Trump again, that's a problem,"" he said in a radio interview on Tuesday.
He has also vowed to kill a Florida bill that would help the former president with his many legal costs, a symbolic legislative blow to Mr Trump.
But it has become quite clear that Mr Trump is consolidating Republican support. He flooded New Hampshire with surrogates, capturing much-needed media and voter attention.
Another former rival for the nomination, Doug Burgum, Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, Ohio Senator JD Vance, Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, the former president's son Eric Trump, Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake and many others made the rounds in recent days.
Ms Haley, who has had much fewer endorsements, struggled to match that pace as voters cast their ballots here on Tuesday.
Now, with a loss in New Hampshire and Mr Trump earning further endorsements, the former UN ambassador is facing growing calls from a deep bench of Republicans to drop out of the race and back Trump.
""I think she has run a great campaign,"" Ronna McDaniel, the Republican Party chairwoman, said on Fox News of Nikki Haley. ""But I do think there is a message that is coming out from the voters, which is very clear: 'we need to unite around our eventual nominee', which is going to be Donald Trump.""

FD47OYW2BF_0HUMWRS3RPPF5FJ,Top Arizona Republican quits over leaked tape offer to Kari Lake,By Max Matza,4 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68089618,"Arizona's Republican party chairman has quit over a leaked tape in which he is heard apparently trying to induce a Senate candidate to quit the race.
On the audio, Jeff DeWit asks Kari Lake if there is ""any number"" that would make her take a political ""pause"" as ""very powerful people"" want her out.
In his resignation letter, he denied any bribery and said Ms Lake had released a ""selectively edited"" tape.
Ms Lake narrowly lost her 2022 race for Arizona governor.
The right-wing firebrand and ally of Donald Trump is now running for the seat currently occupied by independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema.
Arizona Republicans have long worried that Ms Lake's combative style of politics may turn off moderate voters and lose the race, potentially costing Republicans control of the Senate.
In the tape, recorded during a meeting at her house 10 months ago, Mr DeWit tells Ms Lake there are ""very powerful people that want to keep you out"".
He does not name them, but says they are ""back East"".
""I'll tell you what I'm offering you,"" he says, suggesting that she could be put on the payroll of a company in exchange for a two-year ""pause"".
He repeatedly asks her not to tell anyone about their conversation.
""Is there a number at which..."", he says, before Ms Lake interrupts.
""I could be bought? No,"" she replies.
When Mr DeWit says he has doubts that Mr Trump will win the presidential election because of fundraising issues in the state, she disagrees.
""This is about defeating Trump and I think that's a bad, bad thing for our country,"" she argues.
Ms Lake, who had called for Mr DeWit to resign after the tape emerged, welcomed his departure.
""We want ethical leaders,"" she posted on X on Wednesday. ""Time to root-out the corruption at ALL levels - both inside and outside our party.""
Mr DeWit, a former state treasurer, worked for Mr Trump's campaigns in 2016 and 2020.
In his resignation letter on Wednesday, he said that Ms Lake's team had delivered him an ultimatum - ""resign or face the release of a new, more damaging recording"".
He said that since their conversation, Ms Lake ""has been on a mission to destroy me"".
""Contrary to accusations of bribery, my discussions were transparent and intended to offer perspective, not coercion,"" he says.
Mr DeWit is not the only Republican state party leader to leave office this month.
Florida's chairman was voted out by party members after allegations of sexual assault.
Christian Ziegler was cleared by police of rape last week, but could still face a voyeurism charge.
In Michigan, Republicans voted to remove Kristina Karamo as party chair due to infighting and fundraising issues.

A grandfather from Aberdeenshire is unable to leave Dubai following a row with neighbours over a Hogmanay party.
Ian Mackellar, 74, and his wife, of Newtonhill, had been visiting their daughter and young granddaughter in the United Arab Emirates when he went to complain about music noise.
However he was then reported to the police, accused of trespassing. The ongoing investigation means he is not allowed to leave the country.
His anxious wife Carol, 71, told BBC Scotland News: ""We have no idea when Ian will be allowed to come home. The family are all very distressed.""
The Foreign Office has said it is providing assistance.
Mrs Mackellar is hoping the authorities in Dubai will look on the case ""favourably"", as there had been ""no evil intent"" in what happened.
She said they had travelled over last month to help their daughter settle in the country.
However things turned sour when Mr Mackellar went to ask neighbours to turn down music on the night of 31 December as family members were trying to sleep.

Ian Mackellar's wife Carol has said their family are all worried about the situation in Dubai
""The music was like being in a nightclub several doors down, it was bouncing,"" Mrs Mackellar said.
She said her husband went to have a ""neighbour-to-neighbour"" chat to ask them to turn it down a bit.
But she said some people became ""aggressive"", and that one person threw a drink.
Mrs Mackellar said the police then came to their door two days later and informed them of the trespass complaint.

Mrs Mackellar has now returned home, in time for a hospital appointment she had.
She said her husband also had health worries, including a heart issue.
""I am very worried about his state of health and mind,"" she said. ""He's very stressed, and he's worried about me.""
She said what had happened was all over ""something so insignificant"".
""He's such a placid man,"" she said. ""He's a devoted dad and husband.
""We have been married for 49 years and have never really been apart. I just want him home.""
Ian Mackellar's relatives are described as ""very distressed""
Detained in Dubai is an organisation which aims to help foreigners abroad.
Lawyer and Detained in Dubai chief executive Radha Stirling told BBC Scotland there were fears Mr Mackellar could ultimately face two years or more in jail.
""He definitely faces lengthy incarceration,"" she said.
âThis is a very sad situation. Nobody would ever imagine that a polite request to turn the music down would result in a travel ban and criminal prosecution.""
She explained: ""Certainly in other cases we've seen MPs in Scotland get involved with diplomatic support and even arranging meetings with the UAE's ambassador to the UK.
""And in all of these cases that sort of support at the MP level motivates the FCDO (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office) to become involved, and also they can reach out and speak to their counterparts at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  in the UAE and highlight the absurdity of this case.""
A Foreign Office spokesperson confirmed: âWe are providing consular assistance to a British man in Dubai.â
The Government of Dubai Media Office has been approached for comment."

FS25K07ZGQ_NXVBAEY8EMOO2ON,US election 2024: A really simple guide,_,5 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67285325,"Americans will head to the polls in November 2024 to elect the next US president. The person sitting in the White House's Oval Office has a big influence on people's lives both at home and abroad, so the outcome of this election matters for everyone.
The US political system today is dominated by just two parties, so every president in modern times has belonged to one of them.
The Democrats are the liberal political party, with an agenda defined largely by its push for civil rights, a broad social safety net and measures to address climate change.
It is the party of incumbent President Joe Biden, who is trying to secure a second term in power.
The Republicans are the conservative political party in the US. Also known as the GOP, or the Grand Old Party, it has stood for lower taxes, shrinking the size of the government, gun rights and tighter restrictions on immigration and abortion.
The party hasn't yet picked its presidential candidate.
The 2024 election will be on Tuesday, 5 November 2024. The winner will serve a term of four years in the White House starting in January 2025.
The 2024 presidential campaign is well under way. It started with 15 candidates - nine Republicans, four Democrats and two independents - although some of them have already dropped out of the race.
The two main parties nominate a presidential candidate by holding a series of state primaries and caucuses.
There are differences between the parties and the process varies from one state to another.
One of the biggest days is called ""Super Tuesday"", on March 5, because more than a dozen states will hold their primary contests on that day.
President Biden announced his re-election bid earlier this year and - despite some long-shot challenges - is expected to easily win the Democratic Party nomination.
In the Republican Party, President Donald Trump won the first two state contests and already looks set to be the nominee.
There are also some independent candidates running for president, including Robert F Kennedy Jr, nephew to former president John F Kennedy.
Both candidates compete to win electoral college votes.
Each state has a certain number of electoral college votes partly based on its population and there are a total of 538 up for grabs, so the winner is the candidate that wins 270 or more.
This means voters decide state-level contests rather than the national one, which is why it's possible for a candidate to win the most votes nationally - like Hillary Clinton did in 2016 - but still be defeated by the electoral college.
All but two states have a winner-takes-all rule, so whichever candidate wins the highest number of votes is awarded all of the state's electoral college votes.
Most states lean heavily towards one party or the other, so the focus is usually on a dozen or so states where either of them could win. These are known as the battleground states.
All of the attention will be on who wins the presidency, but voters will also be choosing new members of Congress - the government's legislature - when they fill in their ballots.
All 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for election, while 33 Senate seats are also up for grabs.
Republicans control the House and Democrats are in charge of the Senate.
These two chambers pass legislation so can act as a check on White House plans if the controlling party in either chamber disagrees with the president.
If you're a US citizen and you're 18 or over, you should be eligible to vote in the presidential election, which takes place every four years.
Usually a winner is declared on the night of the election, but in 2020 it took a few days to count all the votes.
The period after the election is know as the transition if there is a change of president.
It's a time for the new administration, including cabinet ministers, to form and make plans for the new term.
The president is officially sworn into office in January in a ceremony known as the inauguration, held on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington DC."
FTPNHVNIRD_CG7W2XKB8LTMHQ1,Tata: Steelworkers' Port Talbot protest over cuts plan,By Lewis Smith & Nathan Bevan,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-68109600,"Workers have protested outside Port Talbot's steel plant in a show of support for the industry.
It came after owner Tata's announcement that 2,800 jobs will go, mainly from the south Wales town.
Plans include the shutting down and dismantling of its two primary steelmaking blast furnaces in 2024, to be replaced by an electric arc furnace that produces ""green"" steel.
Tata has said its current operations are financially unviable.
The company said it would build a Â£1.25bn electric arc furnace after the UK government contributed Â£500m towards its cost and end the production of steel from scratch, known as virgin steel, this year.
Staff, unions and residents have said the proposals would leave the town ""doomed"", with many fearful of how they will pay the bills in the wake of the job losses to come.
Jeffrey Wellington, 52, a shift electrician in the steelworks, said it is a place where many generations of families have worked.
""I've been here coming up to 35 years and it's all I've ever known,"" he said.
""Everybody knows someone who works within the steelworks or is associated with it - this is huge for the town.
""My daughter's partner works here and they've just taken out a mortgage and had a baby so they are worried.
""He needs employment but there's nothing like this in the local area, so he'll have to look further afield.
""I'm at the age where I don't want to be travelling too far, but I just feel for the boys who are a lot younger than me really,"" he added.
Shaun Hughes, a 60-year-old machinist who has worked in the steelworks for 44 years, said: ""This is going to have an absolutely massive impact on the town, but also on the whole south Wales corridor in general.
""Families have been panicking since this was originally announced last November and that has not changed one iota.
""I've got children of my own and they are already speaking of leaving the area or going abroad to work, which my wife and myself don't want to see.
He said the steel world served as a ""gimmer of light"" for those in the south Wales valleys who lost their jobs in the mining industry in the 1980s.
""But that has been extinguished now,"" he added.
Julie Morris, 60, from the Sandfields area of the town, said: ""It's going to be a doomed town if they take the steelworks away.
""It's going to be diabolical and will affect the workers, the shops, everybody.""
Former steelworker, Jason Bartlett, of Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, called the situation ""devastating"".
""It will be a completely unrecoverable situation because you can't walk out of this job into another job because they just don't exist in Wales.
""These are worrying times for those with mortgages and young families who are just starting out in their careers within the steel industry.
""All of a sudden they're being told there is no future for them.
He added,: ""These are highly skilled workers who have been told that, by the end of the year, the majority of them won't have jobs.
""We know we've got to transition but we need to keep blast furnace four open until the electric arc is switched on.""

FUY4YWA8CS_KKIGDUUBU80AVG8,Fortnite to come back to iPhones in EU,By Zoe Kleinman & Imran Rahman-Jones,2 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68096730,"Popular video game Fortnite will come back to iPhones after a four-year absence.
Developer Epic Games will be allowed to run its own app store on Apple devices after a new EU law designed to increase competition.
Currently, anyone with an iPhone can only download apps from Apple's own App Store.
But Apple must allow its customers to access alternative app stores on iOS devices purchased in the EU from March.
Apple has always maintained that its rules protect users' security.
In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Fortnite wrote: ""Remember Fortnite on iOS? How bout we bring that back.""
It added: ""Apple, the world is watching.""
Epic Games famously withdrew hit game Fortnite from the App Store after disagreeing with Apple's policies. It has not been available on the App Store since 2020, although it is possible to play it via the web.
Apple had been accused of creating a monopoly, giving customers and developers no choice but to go through its own channels, and charging developers up to 30% commission.
It has meant that developers who either fail to meet Apple's standards for being on the App Store, or do not wish to pay its fees, are excluded from the millions of people who use Apple gadgets.
In Fortnite's X post, it also wrote: ""Shoutout DMA - an important new law in the EU making this possible.""
That refers to the EU's Digital Markets Act coming into effect. The aim of the new law is to regulate the largest companies that are gatekeepers to services such as search engines and app stores to make the market fairer for established companies and smaller firms.
The changes will not apply in the UK at this stage - although the UK's Digital Markets Bill, which is currently going through Parliament, is likely to put Apple's practices under similar regulatory scrutiny.
Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said on X there was a lot of ""hot garbage in Apple's announcement"".
These include, he said, ""junk fees on downloads"".
He may be referring to the core technology fee, which charges developers of apps that are downloaded by over a million people.
Developers will have to pay â¬0.50 for every user who downloads their app, after the first million downloads.
This is a charge to the makers of apps, not to the customers.
Apple also said it would further open up browser choice, so that EU users will be able to opt out of using the firm's Safari web browser from the very first time they open it.
But it warned that while it was setting high standards for all new alternative apps and stores, it believed the move would create additional security risks for customers, and increase their risk of being exposed to malware, fraud and scams hidden within apps from other places.
""The changes we're announcing today comply with the Digital Markets Act's requirements in the European Union, while helping to protect EU users from the unavoidable increased privacy and security threats this regulation brings,"" Apple said.
The US tech giant sells premium-priced products, with the promise that they offer an extra layer of security.
It said: ""For apps that use alternative payment processing, Apple will not be able to issue refunds, and will have less ability to support customers encountering issues, scams, or fraud.""
Android apps can already come from a wider variety of stores. However, as a result, malware is far more common on Android devices than Apple ones.
The purpose of both the new EU rules and UK proposals are to try to maintain open and competitive markets where lots of companies can successfully operate alongside each other.

FWE2DET9QI_SZR1323KUU5HM6A,'Send back our husbands' - Russian women in rare protest,By Steve Rosenberg,6 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68056939,"In a function room on the edge of Moscow, something unusual is happening.
A group of women are publicly criticising the Russian authorities. Their husbands are among the 300,000 reservists mobilised by Russian President Vladimir Putin for the war in Ukraine in autumn 2022.
And they want them home.
""When will our husbands be considered to have discharged their military duty?"" asks Maria. ""When they're brought back with no arms and legs? When they can't do anything at all because they're just vegetables? Or do we have to wait for them to be sent back in zinc coffins?""
The women met via social media and have formed a group called The Way Home. They have differing views on the war. Some claim to support it. Others are sceptical about the Kremlin's ""special military operation"". What seems to unite them is the belief that the mobilised men have done their fair share of the fighting and should be back home with their families.
It is an opinion the authorities do not share.
In Russia public criticism of anything related to the war comes with a risk. Most of the speakers choose their words very carefully. They know there's a string of laws in place now in Russia for punishing dissent. Their frustration, though, is palpable.
""To begin with we trusted our government,"" Antonina says. ""But should we trust them now? I don't trust anyone.""
Members of the group are here to share their stories with a local councillor, Boris Nadezhdin. He has been critical of the ""special military operation"" from the outset.
Curiously Mr Nadezhdin is one of the few government critics who has been allowed onto national television since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He's an occasional guest on TV talk shows.
Right now, the politician is trying to get on the ballot for the presidential election. He maintains that the war has damaged Vladimir Putin's domestic popularity.
""Putin was very popular in Russia because after the 1990s he brought stability and security,"" Mr Nadezhdin tells me. ""Stability and security were the main reason for supporting Putin. Now more and more people have already understood that stability and security are finished.""
Russian women campaigning for the return of their mobilised husbands, sons or brothers have come in for criticism from different quarters. Opponents of the war have little sympathy. They condemn the men for obeying the mobilisation order and for taking part in the war.
Supporters of the Kremlin portray the women as Western stooges.
In a recent interview with the Fontanka news site, Russian MP Andrei Kartapolov, who heads the Russian Duma's defence committee, claimed that the call for demobilisation was the work of ""[Russia's] enemies"". He appeared to suggest that the Ukrainian military or the CIA was behind it.
Mr Kartapolov also invoked World War Two.
""Can you imagine a delegation of wives coming to the Kremlin in autumn 1942 and telling Stalin: 'Let those men who were called up in 1941 go home. They've been fighting for a year already.' No-one would ever have thought of doing that.""
Maria Andreeva, whose husband and cousin have been drafted and despatched to Ukraine, finds Mr Kartapolov's comments insulting.
""He dares to liken the special military operation to the Second World War,"" Maria tells me. ""Back then Russia's aim was survival. We'd been attacked. There was full mobilisation and martial law. It's the total opposite of what is happening now.""
Maria says that she is not only campaigning to bring back her family members. She wants to prevent more Russians being called up and sent to the front line.
""We do not want a second wave of mobilisation,"" she says. ""We're against civilians being used in a military conflict. And we want all Russian citizens to understand this could affect them, too.
""Some people act like ostriches. They stick their heads in the sand and try not to think about what's happening. I can understand them. It's hard to accept that, in your country, the state doesn't need you to be happy - it just treats you as biological material. But if people want to survive, sooner or later they need to recognise this and say that they don't agree.""
How likely is a ""second wave"" of mobilisation in Russia? Last December President Putin appeared to rule it out - for now. Live on Russian TV the Kremlin leader claimed that in 2023 the Russian authorities had managed to recruit nearly half a million volunteers to fight in Ukraine.
""Why do we need mobilisation? As things stand there is no need,"" the Kremlin leader concluded.
Of course, ""as things stand"" doesn't mean ""never going to happen"". Situations can change.
For example, in March 2022 President Putin declared: ""Conscripted soldiers are not participating and will not participate in the fighting. There will not be an additional call-up of reservists, either. Only professional soldiers are taking part.""
""Partial mobilisation"" was announced six months later.
To raise awareness Maria and other wives of mobilised reservists have started a new tradition. Every Saturday they don white headscarves and travel into the centre of Moscow. Near the Kremlin walls they lay flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Red carnations are placed by the Eternal Flame. It is their form of peaceful protest.
On its Telegram channel The Way Forward explains that these flowers are for honouring ""the lives of loved ones. To honour the memory of those killed in all wars. To honour the memory of our guys.""
The group also believes that flower-laying is a way of saying ""never again"".
But how aware is Russian society? How much interest is there from the public in what the families of mobilised reservists are saying? Antonina says that since her partner was drafted, she hasn't felt much support from those around her. When he received his call-up papers in October 2022, he'd asked friends to keep an eye out for Antonina.
""They invited me to celebrate new year with them a year ago,"" she says. ""But all evening they kept telling me that my husband was a total mug for going there [to Ukraine].""
Antonina claims that, despite being diagnosed with stomach ulcers, her partner was deployed to an assault unit in Ukraine. She says that he telephoned her on 4 December.
""He was crying. He was frightened. It sounded like he was saying goodbye.""
She says he called again on 13 December. That was the last time she heard from him. Antonina says she's since been told that her partner was wounded in action.
""There are some people who want to fight. Who volunteer for it and sign contracts,"" Antonina says. ""Let them fight. But send us back our husbands who don't want to be there. They've done their duty to the motherland. Send them home.
""I used to have enormous respect for Vladimir Putin. Now I'm more neutral. I still find it hard to believe that he knows this kind of thing is happening. But if he really does see us as traitors and outcasts for wanting our husbands back, I don't understand why he'd have this attitude towards citizens who once voted for him.""

G0P0I7JL1P_7OGGVUDLXAM5ZOG,Japan: Man sentenced to death for Kyoto anime fire which killed 36,By Frances Mao and Shaimaa Khalil,4 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-68090388,"A Japanese man has been sentenced to death for an arson attack at a Kyoto animation studio in 2019 which killed 36 people and injured dozens more.
The incident, one of Japan's deadliest in recent decades, killed mostly young artists and shocked the anime world.
Shinji Aoba, 45, pleaded guilty to the attack but his lawyers had sought a lighter sentence on grounds of ""mental incompetence"".
Judges rejected this however, ruling that Aoba knew what he was doing.
""I have determined that the defendant was not mentally insane or weak at the time of the crime,"" Chief Judge Masuda said on Thursday at Kyoto District Court.
""The death of 36 people is extremely serious and tragic. The fear and pain of the deceased victims was indescribable,"" Japanese broadcaster NHK reported him saying.
Many of the animation staff - young artists - were killed after being trapped on the upper floors of the studio as the fire spread.
The attack was one of the deadliest cases in recent decades and sparked national mourning in Japan. The country's public and media have followed the case closely.
Prosecutors had demanded the death penalty for Aoba, saying he was motivated to attack the studio after believing his work had been stolen. He said Kyoto Animation - known as KyoAni-  had plagiarised a novel he entered into their contest.
In July 2019, he burst into the studio during a work day, splashing petrol on the ground floor and setting it alight while repeatedly shouting ""Drop dead"".
He later said during his guilty plea in September 2023 that he did not think so many people would die.
""I felt I had no other option but to do what I did,"" he said at the time.
""I feel tremendously sorry and the feeling includes a sense of guilt.""
Aoba himself suffered burns to over 90% of his body in the fire, and was only arrested after he had recovered from operations.
""The delusion that KyoAni Studio had plagiarised his work influenced his motivation,"" prosecutors had told the court.
But they said he was not controlled by such delusions and had full capacity and understanding of his actions.
On Thursday, the judge read out a lengthy reasoning with victim testimonies before announcing the verdict. More than half of the animation studio's 70-strong workforce was killed in the event, and another 32 injured.
""Some of them saw their colleagues engulfed in flames, and some of them are suffering from psychological effects, and they are tormented by feelings of guilt and remorse,"" said Judge Masuda.
Families of the victims were seen in the court room, with many visibly emotional as the judge read out the details of Aoba's crime, NHK reported.
The outlet reported that Aoba kept his head bowed as the judge read out the death penalty sentence.
Japan retains capital punishment for its most serious crimes, like multiple murders. Those convicted typically remain on death row for years, or even decades. The death penalty is conducted by hanging.
The KyoAni studio in Kyoto is a beloved institution, known for producing films and graphic novels that are well-regarded by fans as well as critics - including K-On! and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.

Watch: A video showing a chained lion cub seated in the back of a white, open-top Bentley has gone viral
Police in Thailand have arrested a woman whose pet lion was pictured going on a joyride in the streets of Pattaya.
A video that has now gone viral shows the chained lion cub seated in the back of a white, open-top Bentley.
The lion was being driven about by a Sri Lankan man who has since left the country, and is believed to be a friend of the woman, Sawangjit Kosoongnern.
While it is not illegal to own a lion in Thailand, it needs to be officially registered.
Authorities in Thailand said Ms Sawangjit claimed to have bought the animal from a Thai man in Nakhon Pathom province, who successfully facilitated its delivery to Pattaya.
However he failed to have his facility checked by officials before doing so, which made both the transfer and ownership of the animal illegal.
She is therefore facing charges of possessing a controlled wild animal without permission, which carries a penalty of a year's imprisonment and a fine of up to 100,000 baht ($2,800; Â£2,200).
Police were also reportedly looking to charge the Sri Lankan man, who had kept the lion in his rented pool villa, but were unable to as he is no longer in Thailand. He was due to be charged with bringing a controlled wild animal into public places, which carries jail time of up to six months and a fine of 50,000 baht.
The man who sold the lion to Ms Sawangjit will also face charges of moving an animal without permission.
Officials say there are currently 224 lions in Thailand that are legally owned.

G63GZEN5HF_HVIDO0P1XMJPFJ0,Yes or snow? Reese Witherspoon's viral brew divides opinion,By Ruth Comerford,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68059755,"Oscar-winning actress Reese Witherspoon has whipped up a storm - after scooping snow to make a coffee-caramel drink.
The Legally Blonde star, 47, shared her icy recipe with followers on TikTok, prompting a cool response from many people apparently disturbed by the idea of eating fresh snow.
In a TikTok video now viewed 4.8m times, Witherspoon creates a ""Snow Salt Chococinno"" using snow gathered outside her house, together with cold brew coffee, and lashings of salted caramel and chocolate sauce.
""OK, so we got a tonne of snow over the past few days so we decided to make a recipe,"" she says. ""It is so good!""
But the idea went on to prompt a backlash so fierce the star used a further three videos to address a number of concerned comments from her followers.
""There are so many people on here saying that snow is dirty,"" she says. ""So we went and took snow from the backyard and microwaved it and it's clear - is this bad? Am I not supposed to eat snow?""
Scientists have suggested the first snowfall is not the safest to taste.
After a water droplet freezes and forms a snow flake, it can soak up pollutants from the air as it descends.
The whitest layer the furthest away from the ground is regarded as safer to consume.
Staci Simonich, professor of environmental and toxic ecology at Oregon State University, told the BBC that snow is safe to eat as long as it is from ""a non-urban area"" and that people wait ""until the first few centimetres fallen"".
""The first bit of snow scrubs pollutants from the atmosphere,"" she said, adding that is it best to ""eat a small amount"" from an ""area where no people or animals have walked"".
For Paul Williams, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading, snowflakes ""risk being contaminated with far worse as they lie on the ground, as anyone who has ever seen yellow snow will agree"".
""Would you drink rain? If not, then don't eat snow,"" he added. ""The risks are probably small, but why take the chance - I hate to disagree with Reese Witherspoon, but humans invented water treatment processes for a reason.""
Yet for all those earnestly questioning the safety of eating snow, there appeared to be equal numbers ridiculing the whole debate.
One TikTok user wrote that ""my Canadian self is laughing at the comment... we've been eating snow since we could crawl"".
Another said: ""My entire family grew up making snow ice cream multiple times every winter. 13 of us never once got sick from it.""
And responding to Witherspoon's post, Dr Zachary Rubin - a paediatric allergist based in Illinois - said simply: ""This is not a big deal.""
""Doc says it's fine,"" Witherspoon replied.

GAOY3EPWTC_5VKADFJDVB6KGA1,Horizon scandal: Sussex sub-postmistress cleared after years of suffering,By Tanya Gupta & PA News,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-68094452,"A former sub-postmistress who was convicted of fraud and ordered to repay more than Â£18,000 has had her conviction quashed at London's Court of Appeal.
Kathleen Crane, who had a Post Office branch in Eastbourne, East Sussex, was convicted based on evidence from the faulty Horizon IT system.
She was also given a 12-month community order when she was convicted in 2010.
The 68-year-old mother-of-two wept as her conviction was quashed.
Flora Page, representing her in court, said Mrs Crane had ""suffered in silence"" since her conviction, and said a fraud that she had not committed had brought its own humiliation.
""She works in a care home and she will no longer have to contend, we hope, with the fact that this conviction comes up every year when they do their enhanced checks,"" Ms Page said.
""It will close a very long and painful chapter in Mrs Crane's blameless life.""
At the hearing on Thursday, three appeal judges ruled there was no doubt Mrs Crane's conviction was unsafe, adding she was ""kept in ignorance"" over defects in the Horizon system.
Giving their judgment, Lord Justice Holroyde said: ""We have no doubt that her prosecution was an abuse of process. Nor do we have any doubt that her conviction is unsafe.""
Mrs Crane was one of hundreds of sub-postmasters who were convicted after the Post Office's defective Horizon accounting system produced figures which suggested money was missing from their branches.
Mrs Crane lodged an appeal on 10 January, which the Post Office did not resist.
Her case is one of many expected to reach the Court of Appeal as a result of the Post Office's case review, with the company contacting Mrs Crane last June to say it believed there had been a miscarriage of justice.
Mrs Crane's husband, Robert, became sub-postmaster of the Old Town Post Office in 2000, but she took over due to his ill-health.
In 2010, Mrs Crane was accused of defrauding the company of Â£18,721.52 after an audit found a shortfall.
During the investigation she said she had been aware of inexplicable shortfalls since 2008 and had asked for them to be investigated, but no action had been taken.
She pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation after legal advice made her feel the Horizon system was infallible. She was ordered to pay Â£1,550 in costs and complete 200 hours of unpaid work.
Appeal judges heard the couple were ""at a loss"" to explain the shortfall.
Simon Baker KC, representing the Post Office, said while the company was duty-bound to investigate the case based on evidence available at the time, the case ""amounts to an abuse of process"".
Lord Justice Holroyde, sitting with Mr Justice Picken and Mrs Justice Farbey, said: ""No leap of imagination is needed to understand the anxiety and fear which Mrs Crane and her late husband, who is since sadly deceased, and their two daughters must have experienced.""
He said: ""This is indeed a Horizon case in which the reliability of the Horizon data was essential for the prosecution.
""No relevant investigation was carried out and no disclosure was made of the known concerns about Horizon.
""She (Mrs Crane) pleaded guilty because she and those representing her had been kept in ignorance.""
Mr Crane died in 2016 and Mrs Crane wore his scarf to the hearing.
Following the ruling, a Post Office spokesman said: ""We are deeply sorry for past wrongs and are doing all we can to put these right, including extensive work to support overturning wrongful convictions.
""As part of this work we contacted Mrs Crane and other individuals who were unjustly convicted, on the evidence that we hold, to encourage them to mount an appeal and we are pleased that Mrs Crane's conviction has been overturned.
""Additionally, in 2020 we contacted all current and former postmasters about the launch of the Horizon Shortfall Scheme to encourage more victims to come forward,"" he said.
""We continue to work with the government to support efforts to speed up the exoneration of people with wrongful convictions and ensure compensation is paid.""

GB4MIC952X_QSPM7S9AMCLM5JB,"Civil Service must do more with less, minister John Glen says",By Becky Morton,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68071569,"The Civil Service must ""do more with less"" and make better use of technology to improve the efficiency of government, a minister has said.
In a speech setting out his plans for reform, Cabinet Office Minister John Glen said he wanted ""a smaller, more skilled Civil Service"", with strong performance rewarded with higher pay.
But he added that those underperforming must be ""let go more swiftly"".
Unions said uncompetitive pay rates were to blame for high staff turnover.
Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, said: ""If the minister is serious about a better rewarded civil service, then this year's pay round will be the perfect opportunity for him to show it.""
Last year, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced plans to freeze the expansion of the civil service and reduce staff numbers to pre-pandemic levels, saying this could save Â£1bn a year.
In a speech at the Institute for Government think tank's annual conference in London, Mr Glen said the Civil Service needed to embrace technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to reduce bureaucracy and deliver public services at a lower cost.
Amid concerns about high vacancy rates, he said the government was reviewing pay frameworks for digital and data professionals to ensure they were competitive with similar private sector roles.
As well as helping to attract and retain talent, he argued this would save the taxpayer money by reducing reliance on expensive contractors.
He also announced a review of the Civil Service's approach to performance management, saying poor performance amongst a minority of staff must be addressed.
""In some cases, consistently underperforming staff can languish in roles or move between departments, without properly addressing the reasons for poor performance,"" he said.
""In the worst cases managers can too often feel unable to remove consistently poor performers.""
He reiterated his view that working in the office rather than from home helped staff to be more productive and efficient.
In November, civil servants were told they should spend at least 60% of their working week in the office, with Mr Glen saying senior leaders ""needed to set an example"" on this.
Meanwhile, he announced there would be new guidance on staff diversity networks, which raise awareness of the barriers faced by underrepresented groups.
He said the networks helped make the Civil Service more ""open and inclusive"", but managing them ""should not become a second job"" and they must not undermine impartiality rules.
The minister denied he was trying to stoke ""culture wars"", but said it was important work for networks did not take up ""a disproportionate amount of time"".

Police in Georgetown County, located north of Charleston, later searched the child's home and found weapons secured in a safe.
The child was charged in a juvenile summons with student threats.
A similar incident was reported on the same day, Wednesday, at another school in the same county.
In a statement posted to Facebook, the Georgetown County Sheriff's Office said that the girl will face disciplinary action from the local school district for the incident.
The student is enrolled at Kensington Elementary School, which is located in the county seat of Georgetown. It is unclear if she had access to the weapons found at her home.
In a separate incident reported earlier in the same county earlier on Wednesday, police said that an 11-year-old girl at another elementary school was charged after threatening fellow students.
According to the sheriff's office, the girl reportedly ""said she wanted to shoot up the school after an argument with a fellow student"".
Investigators conducted a search of the child's home but found no weapons. The school continued to operate normally.
The BBC has contacted the Georgetown County School District and the Georgetown County Sheriff's Office for comment.
The South Carolina incidents mark the latest in a series of cases involving children facing charges for allegedly threatening to harm fellow students or school staff.
In another incident in Tahoka, Texas, earlier this week, a 13-year-old girl was reportedly arrested and charged with threatening or exhibiting a firearm. Classes were temporarily halted while the investigation took place.
A 14-year-old was also arrested in Virginia on Wednesday for allegedly making threats against his school on social media.
The teen in James City County near Williamsburg was later charged with making threats of death or injury."

GIL3VLR9PU_URSFW3GMK35LEW3,Irish designer captivates at Paris Couture Week,Matt Fox,24 January 2024,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cxem0v6d7j6o,"Simone Rocha has become the sixth guest couturier for Jean Paul Gaultier
Irish fashion designer Simone Rocha has presented an haute couture collection in Paris.
The Dublin-born creative exhibited her work as a guest couturier for Jean Paul Gaultier on Wednesday.
Gaultier launched the initiative upon his retirement in January 2020 with Rocha becoming the sixth person invited to guest design couture - the most elite branch of the fashion industry.
âI was really humbled, excited and enthusiastic when I got the call,"" Rocha told BBC News NI ahead of the show.
""I think itâs a real gift that he has done this way of working. It feels really generous... to be so open to interpretation.""
The collection was an ""invited challenge"", Simone Rocha says
As part of the process, the 'enfant terrible' gives his guests free reign to interpret the Gaultier brand as they see fit.
""He wants to wait to see it in the show, because it's designer to designer - that's the best process,"" Rocha said.
When the show was announced, fashion commentators speculated on how Rocha's hyper-feminine, whimsical signatures would translate to the Jean Paul Gaultier brand.
""I love that,"" Simone said.
""When I was asked to do it, straight away I could see it being very feminine but also very provocative and playful, all these iconic Gaultier troupes.""
Rocha had free reign to interpret the Gaultier brand
Rocha described the opportunity as an ""invited challenge"" and she relished in exploring Gaultier's archives.
""Some were quite preserved, all in tissue in these wooden boxes, which are actually called coffins - which I also loved - some pieces were so old they were almost starting to disintegrate, so you couldn't even try them on,"" she said.
Corsetry and conical bras make several appearances throughout the collection
Hand-crochet and manipulated Irish lace feature in the collection, which includes ""a nice mix of techniques that feel very close to home"".
However, Simone also embraced newer design methods ""that feel almost a bit alien, but amazing"".
""Itâs quite a labour intensive process, but at the same time I think weâve been using restraint in some areas and then [been] excessive in others,"" she explained.
The Gaultier-staple sailor hat was finished with a signature Simone Rocha bow
Rocha appears to have struck the balance, according to early reviews from the fashion press who have praised her reimagining of Gaultier's conical bras, corsets and sailor hats.
The collection marked ""a new high point in the Irish designer's career"", according to The Irish Times, which claimed each item was ""outstanding in its own way""., external
""It's that rare collection where every single look warrants conversation,"" added Fashionista, while Harper's Bazaar has deemed the show ""a resounding success"", external full of ""exquisite tulle creations"".
Elle magazine labeled the partnership ""a meeting of minds and beauty"", and, as for the main man, Jean Paul told The Guardian that the collection âwent beyond what [he] expected""., external
Since graduating Central Saint Martins in 2010, Rocha has established herself as one of the world's leading fashion designers, receiving numerous accolades for her work.
These include Harper's Bazaar Designer of the Year Award and Fashion Awards for Emerging Talent, The New Establishment Award and British Womenswear Designer.
As the daughter of esteemed designer John Rocha, she has carried the family name to further prominence with stores in London, New York, Taipei and Hong Kong, and notable collaborations with Moncler, H&M and J Brand.

Born in Dublin in 1989, Rocha has spoken of a colourful childhood filled with music and laughter.
She began assisting her father from a young age, immediately feeling at ease in the studio but unsure of her future creative practice.
""They used to have really good parties in the house I grew up in. Shane MacGowan, Van the Manâ¦ it was really fun. Wild. All the kids just ran around and what was really nice is that we were always very much a family,"" she previously told The Telegraph.
It is those strong family ties that took the designer across the world from a young age, regularly visiting relations in Hong Kong.
Simone is the daughter of renowned Chinese-Irish designer John Rocha
""I'm really proud of being half Irish and half Chinese,"" Rocha told BBC News NI.
""I grew up in Ireland and I really enjoyed it. I was really fortunate to go to art college in Dublin [National College of Art] before I went to do my masters in London.
""There's such a natural heritage of storytelling, writing, music, film [in Ireland]. And it has completely been a part of the work that I make... the duality and contrast of being from two different places.
""A lot of the [Irish] landscape has really influenced my textiles and fabrication and then, contrasting that with this idea of the man-made, the practical side of life and living, has been a big part of my process.""
Irish literature and traditions have inspired Simone's past collections
The Children of Lir, wren boys, mummers and John Millington Syngeâs Riders to the Sea have influenced Rocha's designs in recent seasons.
""I'd read the body of text [Riders to the Sea] and I was also thinking about the traditional mourners in the Aran Islands and how the women used to dye their petticoats and wear them as veils,"" she said.
Envisioning men lost at sea, she was inspired to create lifejacket-inspired Aran stitch knitwear.
The mourners of the Aran Islands were referenced in her autumn 2020 collection
When Rocha decided to show menswear and womenswear together for winter 2023, she initially explored traditional Irish relationship rituals.
""Folklore, things like a snail leaving tracks of an [initial] in flour... throwing an apple on the floor to foretell the name of your loved one,"" she explained.
Rocha's autumn 2023 collection looked to Lughnasadh for inspiration
Rocha presented both menswear and womenswear during her last London show
As her research deepened, Rocha looked to Lughnasadh - an Irish autumn festival with pagan origins.
What followed was elaborate, macramÃ© garments paired with red ribbon 'tears', which she said represented  the blood traditionally daubed on children's foreheads to protect them from harm.
The collection was the beginning of an ""all encompassing"" triptych, exploring preservation and historical dress, with Wednesday's couture show a second offering.
Her winter 2024 collection, due to be presented next month in London, has seen the designer explore an alternative archive.
""I was privy to all of Queen Victoria's mourning clothes... it's been amazing, I've been exploring this idea of preserved clothes and mourning, and that's going to influence the collection in February.""
âShe does not custom-make anything and I was just like, [bats eyes] âplease',â Billie Eilish told Vogue at the 2023 Met Gala
Rocha explained that her work has always ""felt like an extension of [herself]"" and it is a ""huge compliment"" to have it embraced by a growing fanbase.
Reflecting on her earliest shows and the supports available, Rocha admitted the industry has changed significantly over the last decade, partly because of the Covid pandemic.
""There was a huge appetite, suddenly even if you were showing in London you felt totally international, and I do feel like that's still the case,"" she said.
""I think the industry itself, post pandemic, retail has all had a shift.
""Everyone - especially if you're independent - had to step back and look at your business, your identity, what you want to say and think of the steps to go forward.
""That comes with experience... for young designers the whole landscape is harder to navigate.""
Her spring 2024 collection saw the designer collaborate with cult footwear brand Crocs
Having said that, opportunity is aplenty, Rocha explained, with designers no longer fixed to the traditional fashion colleges and capitals.
""If you make the right work, you can share it now with social media, you don't have to be at the fashion week, people are producing at different times, it's so less regimented... people can see it in all different ways,"" she said.
""If you do something that you really believe in and you do it really well, it'll find the space and people will find you.""
Haute couture is considered the ultra-elite of fashion design.
The clothes are often made from the finest of materials and are extremely expensive with starting prices in the tens of thousands.
The âhaute coutureâ (high dressmaking) denomination is legally protected and its requirements are defined by the French chamber of commerce.

GMXKVKSVG1_6YJXI6RXWKEF7UU,Norwich: Pupils to receive support following deaths of four people,By Mariam Issimdar,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-68051154,"Pupils at schools attended by two young girls found dead along with two adults are to be offered trauma support.
The four were all discovered at a house in Costessey, near Norwich, at about 07:15 GMT on Friday.
The girls, a woman, 36, and a 45-year-old man, named locally as Bartlomiej Kuczynski, were found dead inside the property in Allan Bedford Crescent.
Both children attended local schools and head teachers have said pupils would be offered support.
Matthew Cross, headteacher at Queen's Hill Primary School and Dr Roger Harris at Taverham High School acknowledged the challenges their pupils could face.
""Both our schools have worked closely alongside colleagues from Norfolk County Council's Critical Incident Support Team over the weekend to ensure we have extra support and provision in place, so we can meet the needs of both our pupils and staff at this difficult time,"" they said in a joint statement.
Dr Bianca Finger-Berry, critical incident lead at Norfolk County Council, said: ""Normal routines with opportunities to access additional services can be really helpful.""
She added that children would be able to ""receive emotional support from school staff and educational professionals"".
Norfolk Police said a man and children lived at the Costessey address, and the woman who died was a relative who was not a permanent resident.
Post-mortem examinations carried out on Sunday revealed Mr Kuczynski died from a single stab wound to the neck while the woman died from multiple stab wounds to her neck.
Formal identification had yet to take place and next of kin were being kept informed of developments and supported by specialist officers.
Detectives also confirmed they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.
Det Ch Insp Chris Burgess said: ""This is a tragic incident, distressing for all involved and it is clear from the reaction it's caused a lot of shock and upset in the local community.""
On Saturday, Norfolk Police said it had referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) for the second time.
The first referral was over a callout to the same house on 14 December as part of a missing persons inquiry.
The force confirmed that investigation would now be re-examined.
A second referral was made due to 999 call being received from the house at 06:00 on Friday, to which officers were not deployed.

GT5PGVWOLU_6AW8CDTKKHLYDOC,Gaza war: ICJ to rule on call for Israel to stop military action,By Anna Holligan and Raffi Berg,3 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68059715,"The UN's top court is to decide whether to issue emergency measures ordering Israel to halt its operations in Gaza.
The session of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Friday is part of a case brought by South Africa alleging that Israel is committing genocide.
Both countries testified when the case opened two weeks ago. Israel has vehemently rejected the allegation.
A ruling against Israel is not enforceable by the court but would be politically significant.
More than 25,000 Palestinians - mostly women and children - have been killed and tens of thousands injured, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, since Israel began its offensive, triggered by an unprecedented attack on Israel by the group.
The Hamas attack on 7 October killed about 1,300 people, mainly civilians. The attackers also took about 250 people back to Gaza as hostages.
South Africa, which strongly supports the Palestinians, asked the court to issue nine provisional measures, including a halt to military activity by Israel, while it considers the accusation of genocide. A ruling on the latter is not expected for a long time, possibly years.
Israel reacted with outrage to the genocide allegation, accusing South Africa of distorting the truth. It said it had a right to defend itself and was targeting Hamas fighters, not Palestinian civilians.
It asked the judges to dismiss South Africa's request which it said was based on ""grossly distorted"" and baseless allegations of a non-existent genocide.
In reaching a ruling on Friday, the 17 judges - 15 permanent justices, plus one each from South Africa and Israel - must answer two questions:
Also, the judges are not limited to South Africa's specific requests. The panel could simply instruct Israel to ensure its actions comply with international law and to ensure that it does not do anything to impede deliveries of food, water or medicines.
The ICJ, though, only has the power to issue advisory opinions. And while its rulings are in theory legally binding, they are not enforceable by the court. If Friday's ruling go against Israel, it is almost certain to be ignored.
It would, however, place additional political pressure on Israel to work towards a ceasefire, and will intensify pressure on Israel's strongest international allies to do what they can behind the scenes to find a resolution and guarantee humanitarian assistance gets to where it is needed."

Listen: AI-generated robocall impersonates Joe Biden's voice
A fake robocall claiming to be from US President Joe Biden has urged voters to skip Tuesday's primary election in New Hampshire.
An investigation has been opened into the calls, which are suspected to have been artificially generated.
It is unclear who created the audio. The Trump campaign has denied involvement.
In the message, a voice tells voters to ""save"" their ballot for the general election in November.
""Republicans have been trying to push nonpartisan and Democratic voters to participate in their primary. What a bunch of malarkey,"" says the message.
But there is no rule that says people who vote in a primary cannot cast a ballot in the general election, so there is no reason to ""save"" a vote.
The New Hampshire attorney general's office said in a statement: ""Although the voice in the robocall sounds like the voice of President Biden, this message appears to be artificially generated based on initial indications.""
It added that the ""messages appear to be an unlawful attempt to disrupt"" the election on Tuesday, and that ""voters should disregard the content of this message entirely"".
To recipients, the robocalls falsely appeared to be coming from the personal mobile phone number of a former state Democratic chairwoman, Kathy Sullivan, who helps run a pro-Biden political group in New Hampshire.

Watch: Whatâs at stake for Trump and Haley in New Hampshire?
""This call links back to my personal cell phone number without my permission,"" she said in a statement, calling it ""outright election interference"".
Anti-robocall application Nomorobo estimates the calls were placed between 5,000 and 25,000 times, reports CNN.
On Monday, White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed that the audio was fake. Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez criticised the call as an attempt to ""suppress voting and deliberately undermine free and fair elections"".
In the New Hampshire primary, voters from both main parties are picking which candidate should be their standard-bearer in this year's general election.
Though Mr Biden's name will not appear on the New Hampshire primary ballot, a campaign led by state and local Democrats has taken shape for voters to write in his name.
The decision to remove his name came after Mr Biden approved a new voting calendar that stripped New Hampshire of its status as the first state to hold a primary.
Mr Biden is all but certain to win the state and his party's nomination to seek a second term in the White House.

H0DQFA5XBC_UHOQVT18KSAE4FH,Man held for murder over South Africa building fire,By Daniel De Simone,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-68074917,"A man has been arrested on suspicion of 77 murders after telling a public inquiry he started last August's deadly fire in a Johannesburg building.
The 29-year-old confessed while giving evidence at the inquiry, police said.
Last year fire gutted the Usindiso building in Marshalltown, where many poor people were living, claiming 77 lives and leaving many injured.
The tragedy highlighted the issue of buildings abandoned or neglected by their owners in South Africa.
A South African Police Service spokesperson said the suspect, who cannot be identified, is expected to appear in court soon.
He is also expected to face charges of arson and 120 counts of attempted murder.
The individual confessed to ""being involved in starting the tragic fire"" while giving evidence during a session of the inquiry, police said.
The Usindiso building was home to hundreds of people, some of the poorest people in South African society.
Such abandoned buildings are often left without basic services such as water and electricity or fire safety measures - and are sometimes ""hijacked"" or taken over by criminals who make demands on residents.
The City of Johannesburg owned the Usindiso building and on Monday, Mayor Kabelo Gwamanda said 188 ""bad"" buildings were being investigated, with 134 of them in the inner city.
The public inquiry into the disaster is taking evidence on the fire and the wider issue of unsafe buildings and is due to report later this year.
Shortly after the fire President Cyril Ramaphosa said it had been a ""wake-up call"" for South Africa and the city of Johannesburg had to get to grips with issues around housing and services in Johannesburg's inner city.
South Africa faces a chronic housing shortage, with an estimated 15,000 people believed to be homeless in Johannesburg.

H0TSW071A5_SJ6YDUNAIRDQ84A,"Royal Mail could deliver on three days, regulator says",By Michael Race,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68067702,"Royal Mail could reduce the number of days it delivers letters from six per week to five or even three, under proposals to reform the service.
A report from the regulator said the postal service was ""getting out of date"" and action needed to be taken.
Ofcom said another option would be extending the number of days it takes for most letters to be delivered.
Royal Mail said its current delivery network was ""not sustainable"" and that reform was ""urgently needed"".
The company, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, is legally obliged to deliver a one-price-goes-anywhere universal service, which means it has to deliver letters six days per week, Monday to Saturday, and parcels Monday to Friday.
In recent years, the volume of letters being posted has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels, while parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable.
Royal Mail's performance has also deteriorated, with customers regularly not receiving letters about medical appointments and legal documents on time.
Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom's chief executive, said the regulator was sharing options for reforming the service, putting them out for ""national discussion"", with an update scheduled for the summer.
""Something's got to give, or the service is going to be too costly, and either stamp prices will go up or it will become unsustainable,"" she told BBC Breakfast.
The government has said it does not support the idea of scrapping postal deliveries on Saturdays.
Kevin Hollinrake, the postal services minister, told the BBC Royal Mail needed to ""up their game"" and that the government was ""happy to have a conversation"" about reforms.
But he insisted that Saturday deliveries were ""sacrosanct"" and that a six-day service would remain.
On Wednesday the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said the government was ""absolutely committed"" to ensuring the Royal Mail's universal service obligations remained as they were.
Ofcom estimated the company could save between Â£100m and Â£200m a year if delivery days were cut to five per week, and between Â£400m and Â£650m if there were just three postal days.
However, reforming the postal service by cutting delivery days would require the government and parliament to change the current legislation.
Are you affected by the issues raised in this story? Get in touch.
An alternative option would be to to reduce the speed of delivery for most letters to within three days. That would save Â£150 to Â£650m, Ofcom said, but the regulator said there would still need to be a next-day service available for any urgent letters.
Under Ofcom's current rules, each year Royal Mail is required to deliver 93% of First Class post within one working day and 98.5% of Second Class within three working days, but in 2022/23 the company only delivered 73.7% of First Class and 90.7% of Second Class mail on time.
That has left many customers dissatisfied, among them Peter Rimmer, from Ormskirk, Lancashire, who told the BBC he already only seems to get post once a week.
The former communications director, 78, said his post arrives in a bundle from a different postie each time.
Last week a Christmas card arrived that had been posted on the 8 December with the correct address and first class stamp on it. ""It's not a regular service,"" he said.
Royal Mail has previously made clear it would like to shift from delivering six days a week to five, from Monday to Friday only. The business, which is owned by International Distribution Services plc, posted a Â£319m loss in the first half of the current financial year.
Martin Seidenberg, Royal Mail's group chief executive, said a ""lack of action"" on reforms before, now meant the business faced a ""much more serious situation"".
But the Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represent posties, said the union would not sign up to a three-day delivery service, claiming it would ""destroy"" Royal Mail and ""impact thousands of jobs"".
The UK was ""not alone"" in needing to reform its postal service, Ofcom said. It noted Sweden, Belgium, Norway and Denmark had either reduced delivery days or extended delivery times for letters in recent years.
But Dame Melanie said neither reducing delivery days nor extending delivery times would represent an ""easy pass"" for the company as it would still have to meet set delivery targets.
Ofcom said the company's recent poor performance, which led it being fined Â£5.6m for missing its delivery targets, showed that people were not currently getting a reliable service. The regulator said its research showed people valued affordability and reliability the most when it came to letter postage.
Morgan Wild, interim director of policy at the charity Citizens Advice, said any changes to the universal postal service must prioritise consumers, ""not Royal Mail's bottom line"".

H0YTQXT7KL_CGMULOIDPGVL63H,Antoinette Lattouf: ABC presenter sacked over Gaza post ignites row in Australia,By Tiffanie Turnbull,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-68064851,"On 20 December Antoinette Lattouf signed off from the Sydney radio show she was hosting with a promise she'd be back the next day.
""Can't wait,"" she told listeners.
But the veteran journalist and presenter did not return to the airwaves. Later that afternoon she was sacked, with her boss saying the order had come from ""above"".
She was only three days into a week-long stint filling in as host of the local Mornings show on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Just hours earlier she insists she was told it was going well.
But behind the scenes, her appointment to the coveted role had attracted ardent lobbying from pro-Israel groups who accused her of antisemitism and bias.
Lattouf - who is of Lebanese heritage - says she fears the ABC buckled under external pressure, sacking her based on political opinion and race. She has launched a wrongful termination case.
The broadcaster vehemently denies this and says Lattouf was let go because she broke its directions on social media by re-sharing a Human Rights Watch (HRW) post about the Israel Gaza war.
Her dismissal has triggered a wave of public outrage and created turmoil at the public broadcaster - raising questions over its independence and reviving concerns over how it supports staff, particularly those who are culturally diverse, when they come under attack.
Lattouf is believed to be the first Arab-Australian woman to be a reporter on commercial television, and today is a regular staple on Australian airwaves or in its local newspapers.
But the 40-year-old has also made a name for herself as an activist on issues like racism, discrimination in media and mental health.
Before she was hired by the ABC, Lattouf attracted criticism for social media posts on the Israel Gaza war which decried the impact on Palestinian civilians.
In some posts she accused Israel of targeting and killing journalists in Gaza, something echoed by the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists but which Israel denies.
She also drew ire for an article she co-authored in which online verification experts questioned video which purported to show pro-Palestinian protesters chanting ""gas the Jews"" at a march in Sydney.
The ABC has stressed the critical importance of impartiality and also has strict social media requirements. It bans posts which could damage its reputation.
Lattouf has long been a regular contributor to the ABC, and agreed to curtail her social media use when she started her presenting stint.
But she says she was told sharing information from ""reputable"" sources like human rights groups was fine, and so on 19 December shared a post from HRW which said Israel was using starvation as a tool of war. Israel denies the accusation.
Lattouf's post came hours after the ABC itself had covered the HRW report, and Lattouf claims other ABC employees had also shared the post. She also alleges other staff have written ""far more inflammatory"" social media posts in the past but remain employed.
""The difference between them is they are white and I have an Arab background,"" she told the BBC.
She wants a public apology from the ABC, compensation, and a similar role back on air.
But in its reply to Ms Lattouf's legal action, the ABC said her case was ""entirely misconceived"", and she was taken off-air ""because she failed or refused to comply with directions that she not post on social media about matters of controversy"".
She was paid for all five shifts, it added.
The case sparked an immediate uproar in Australia.
HRW wrote to the ABC Chair, Ita Buttrose, saying it was ""troubling"" that its ""factual"" material had been deemed ""controversial'"", something it said could have a ""chilling effect"" on Australian journalism.
The media union also called the decision to remove Lattouf ""incredibly disturbing"", while Minister for Industry Ed Husic said people expressing a ""peaceful"" view ""shouldn't feel like their jobs are on the line"".
Protestors have graffitied ABC offices in Perth and Melbourne, and crowdfunding for Lattouf's legal fees has already raised over A$90,000 (Â£40,100; $62,500).
Others, defending the broadcaster's decision to sack her, argued she shouldn't have been hired for the role in the first place - given her history on the issue.
But a series of leaked WhatsApp chats have in recent days have dramatically intensified the storm.
Dozens of messages from two groups seen by the BBC show a concerted letter-writing campaign against Lattouf in the days before she was fired.
The hundreds of members in both groups - one called Lawyers for Israel and another called J.E.W.I.S.H Australian creatives and academics - were encouraged to write directly to ABC boss David Anderson, the ABC board and Communications Minister Michelle Rowland.
""It is important ABC hears not just from individuals in the community but specifically lawyers so they feel there is an actual legal threat,"" wrote one member of Lawyers for Israel, Nicky Stein, something she later admitted ""a bit cheeky"".
Some letter-writers claimed they had received direct responses from board chair Ita Buttrose and when news of Lattouf's exit spread, many congratulated themselves.
""Good riddance to bad rubbish,"" one person said.
""No doubt the PP [pro-Palestinians] will start whinging now about censorship and the Jewish lobby controlling the media,"" another wrote.
And when she launched her legal case in the Fair Work Commission (FWC) one person called her lawyer, who is Jewish, a ""traiter"".
Several members of the Lawyers for Israel chat have denied the group - which included Jewish community leaders - was controlled by any bodies or intended for organised lobbying.
Ms Stein told the Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) it was simply ""a group of lawyers concerned about Israel and rising antisemitism"".
The WhatsApp messages sparked a livid meeting of the ABC staff union, attended by about 200 people.
One of the broadcaster's most senior journalists, global affairs editor John Lyons, reportedly said the release of the messages marked ""one of [the ABC's] darkest days"".
""When I read those WhatsApp messages, for the first time everâ¦ I felt embarrassed to work for the ABC,"" he said, according to the SMH.
""I was embarrassed that a group of 156 lawyers could laugh at how easy it was to manipulate the ABC.""
The meeting culminated in a rare vote of no confidence in the ABC boss David Anderson.
Union members made a list of demands, giving the editorial leadership team until Monday to respond. They have previously threatened a walkout if their concerns aren't addressed.
The ABC board responded by calling its own emergency meeting and passing a unanimous vote of confidence in Anderson.
""Any suggestion I would not defend our position when external pressure is applied - regardless of where that pressure is coming from - is offensive and incorrect,"" he said in a statement.
He agreed to meet staff - but ""in the coming weeks"".
The case has reopened old wounds for the ABC.
It has revived concerns about how it treats diverse staff, after an ugly saga last year in which pioneering Aboriginal journalist Stan Grant quit over what he called a failure to protect him from racist attacks.
And it's also fed uneasiness about the broadcaster's independence. Advocates worry that politicised appointments to the ABC board, its government-dictated funding model, and increased - often frenzied - scrutiny is jeopardising its work.
The saga also comes as the broader Australian media grapples with tension over the impartiality of its coverage of the Israel Gaza war.
Most notably, ABC political reporter Nour Haydar left the public broadcaster this month over its coverage of the war, as well as its treatment of culturally diverse staff.  The ABC has defended its impartiality and said it is ""continuing to progress"" on diversity matters despite having its ""most representative"" workforce ever.
Lattouf says its these broader themes that make her case so important.
""It is not just about me. It's about free speech, it's about racismâ¦ and crucially, it's also about a fair, independent and robust ABC,"" she told reporters last week.
After a failed mediation meeting, the ABC is now attempting to have Lattouf's case thrown out, arguing it didn't actually sack her.
The matter is back at the FWC in March, and Lattouf says she's in it for the long haul.
""I'm willing and prepared to fight for as long as it takes,"" she said.

HA5FDX9VNM_QVU1ZNA031S0BQ3,Derogatory texts between Humza Yousaf and Jason Leitch released,_,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-68104494,"Derogatory WhatsApp messages between Scotland's first minister and its national clinical director have been published by the UK Covid Inquiry.
The messages show that Humza Yousaf and Jason Leitch used insulting language about opposition politicians.
Mr Leitch described a female Labour MSP as a ""new girl"" and said a Tory MSP had been ""harrumphing like a child"".
Mr Yousaf used expletive language to describe former Labour MSP Neil Findlay.
The message exchange between the pair happened shortly after Mr Yousaf was appointed health secretary in 2021, and saw him joke at one point that he was ""winging it! And will get found out sooner rather than later"", followed by a laughing emoji.
Mr Leitch responded: ""Me too. That doesn't change"".
The inquiry has heard that Mr Yousaf also described the Scottish Police Federation as a ""disgrace"" while he was serving as justice secretary earlier in the pandemic.
And it was shown a text message exchange between his predecessor, Nicola Sturgeon, and her chief of staff Liz Lloyd in which Ms Sturgeon referred to then Prime Minister Boris Johnson as a ""(expletive) clown"".
Ms Sturgeon and Ms Lloyd were also shown discussing Covid rules and the Scottish government's strategy for dealing with the pandemic, with Ms Lloyd saying at one point that she wanted a ""good old fashioned rammy"" with the UK government so she could ""think about something other than sick people"".
Ms Lloyd, who was a close confidante of Ms Sturgeon, told the inquiry in her evidence on Thursday that she was ""looking for a public spat with a purpose"" over the UK government's furlough scheme as ""public spats could often deliver results"".
The inquiry, which is currently sitting in Edinburgh, has been told that Ms Sturgeon failed to keep any of her messages from the pandemic but the exchange was handed over to the inquiry by Ms Lloyd.
Mr Yousaf has already apologised to the inquiry for the Scottish government's ""frankly poor handling"" of requests for text messages and has pledged that an external review will be held into its use of messaging apps such as WhatsApp.
A batch of documents was released by the inquiry after Thursday's evidence session.
They included messages in which Mr Leitch claimed that Labour leader Anas Sarwar told him he was ""struggling"" with Paul Sweeney as a new Labour MSP and with what Mr Leitch called ""a new girl"" - the Labour MSP Mercedes Villalba - shortly after the 2021 election.
Mr Leitch, who featured prominently in the media during the pandemic, also used a derogatory word to describe Labour MSP Daniel Johnson and alleged that Conservative MSP Edward Mountain had been ""rude"" and ""harrumphing like a child"" at a briefing.
He has previously denied giving Mr Yousaf a ""workaround"" to Covid rules when he was health secretary by advising him to keep a drink in his hand at all times to remain ""exempt"" from face mask rules at a dinner.
But he said he followed Scottish government records management policies, and described a WhatsApp comment he made about deleting messages being a ""pre-bed ritual"" as a ""flippant exaggeration"".
Mr Findlay tweeted that the comments made about him showed that Mr Yousaf did not like being held to account and that Mr Yousaf and Mr Leitch had ""utter contempt"" for MSPs who did not ""unquestioningly accept"" what they were being told by the government.
He added: ""One of the most important jobs of opposition politicians is to hold the government to account.""
Labour called for Mr Leitch to be sacked after it emerged that he used an auto-delete function on a Covid WhatsApp chat during the pandemic.
Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said that it was Jason Leitch's job to answer hard questions, and that it was ""unacceptable"" for him to make personal remarks.
He added: ""There is a rotten culture at the top that permeates to senior officials, where the lines of communication get blurred.""
Scottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said it was ""totally inappropriate that a supposedly impartial health advisor was behaving like a paid-up member of the SNP during the pandemic"".
Mr Hoy added: ""The messages that have come to light from others reveal that Jason Leitch laughed as the future first minister insulted others, and that he even joined in the mud-slinging at politicians from other parties.
""It is no wonder that he became a cheerleader for the industrial-scale deletion of WhatsApps from those at the top of the SNP-Government, and that it became a 'pre-bed ritual' for him and his colleagues to hide petty attacks - and much else besides - such as these.
""Mr Leitch must now do the decent thing and resign or be sacked as National Clinical Director as it is clear that he is not fit for the role.""
SNP leader at Westminster, Stephen Flynn, was asked by BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme if he had lost faith in Mr Leitch and if he should apologise.
Mr Flynn said: ""I don't think it would be unreasonable""
A Scottish government spokesperson said it would be ""inappropriate"" to comment on any evidence while the hearings were taking place.
They also stated that ""learning lessons"" was vital for the future.
In his evidence to the inquiry on Thursday, Mr Yousaf offered an ""unreserved"" apology for the Scottish government's ""frankly poor"" handling of requests from the inquiry for WhatsApp messages to be handed over.
He accepted that this would have caused ""serious grief and retrauma"" for those who lost loved ones during the pandemic.
Mr Yousaf added: ""There is no excuse for it, we should have done better and it is why I reiterate that apology today.""
SNP MP Ian Blackford told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the Scottish government had made 28,000 messages available to the inquiry, which he said was in ""stark contrast"" to the UK government's handling of messages.
He added: ""At the time that Covid was taking place there was only one thing above all else on the first minister's mind and that was giving leadership over the Covid crisis."""
HBZTHAV94G_POVQXMKX07BEGEU,Decades-old jar of sauce donated to food bank,_,24 January 2024,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cxerm3rgmpvo,"A manager said the jar was older than some of their volunteers
A food bank has asked people to be ""a bit more careful when donating"" after they received a jar of cooking sauce with an expiry date of 1998.
The jar of Mr Ben's dauphinoise gratin sauce was among donations given to the Sunderland and County Durham Food Bank in Hendon.
A warehouse volunteer noticed it because the label looked faded and the contents appeared ""a little grey"".
Food supply manager Jonathan Conlon said there was no chance of the sauce, which is at least 25 years old, ending up on someone's plate.
Volunteers at the food bank's warehouse were surprised when they found a jar of Uncle Ben's 'NEW' Gratins Dauphinoise Cheese & Onion sauce, with a best before date of June 1998, had been donated.
Mr Conlon said: ""We get things that are a couple of years out of date and occasionally at harvest time, for example, we get things that people have cleared out from the back of the cupboards.
""So it's not unusual to get the odd donation that is out of date, maybe a year or two, but this is the record.""

HED372SFYD_ASEZ9R0XTFBBZDF,"Abuja sisters' kidnapping: Nigeria police did not free them, we paid ransom, family says",By Mansur Abubakar,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-68058229,"Nigerian police had no role in rescuing four sisters and their cousin from kidnappers, an uncle of the girls has told the BBC.
They were taken from their home in Abuja earlier this month, along with another sister who was later killed.
The uncle said a ransom was paid and the kidnappers dropped the girls in a forest for them to be collected.
On Sunday, police said they had ""successfully rescued the victims"", reuniting them with relatives.
Sheriff Al-Kadriyar, the girls' uncle, said the family went to collect them after a ransom was paid.
""There's nothing like rescue on this matter, we paid ransom - even though I can't disclose how much for security reasons,"" he told BBC Yoruba.
The Nigerian police spokesperson has not responded to a BBC request for comment.
The case has shocked the country, with people donating to a crowdfunding initiative to help raise the money.
In total five sisters were taken hostage in the Abuja suburb of Bwari on 2 January, along with their father Mansoor Al-Kadriyar, who was later released to raise the ransom.
Sheriff Kadriyar clarified that contrary to earlier reports that six Al-Kadriyar sisters had been abducted, one of the girls was in fact their cousin who had been staying with them over the school holidays.
Twenty-one-year-old Nabeeha, a final-year university student, was killed a few days after her father's release as a warning that the ransom of $68,000 (Â£53,000) must be paid.
Nigeria's defence minister had urged the family not to pay the ransom, but the Al-Kadriyars said they had no choice.
A controversial law that criminalises ransom payments was passed in 2022 aimed at tackling the country's spiralling and lucrative kidnapping industry.It carries a jail sentence of at least 15 years for anyone who pays a ransom, however no-one has been arrested, and a former minister is among those who said he had helped organise the payment to the kidnappers of the Al-Kadriyar sisters.
Sheriff Kadriyar, who said he was involved in negotiating with the kidnappers, explained that the money had been handed over to them on Wednesday.
His account backs up two others given by relatives to Nigeria's Daily Trust newspaper.
They all say that the girls were released on Saturday. One of them then called the family in the early evening, giving their location.
""The kidnappers chose the day and the location we were to pick up the girls about four or five days after ransom payment,"" the uncle said.
A group of male relatives then headed to the Kajuru Forest in neighbouring Kaduna state to find them. Along the way they chanced upon an army unit and requested help.
These army officers escorted them to find the girls - afterwards taking them all home by around 23:30 local time (22:30 GMT).
""We are happy and we thank God that the girls were found alive,"" the uncle said.
His brother and nieces were now being treated at a medical facility, he said.
Kidnapping has become rife in Nigeria, with hundreds of people abducted in recent years, largely by criminal gangs who see it as an easy way to make money. It has been particularly bad in the north-west of the country.
There has been an outcry that the insecurity has reached the capital, prompting Abuja's police force to launch a special squad to tackle the kidnapping gangs last week.
The family did not want to discredit the police but wanted to make it clear how they had managed to free the girls, Sheriff Kadriyar said.

HEY177RGNQ_UYGQ7EM6D33Y8TE,'Jumping' rollercoaster and other world record-breaking rides,_,5 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/48430614,"Universal Studios in Japan is introducing one of the world's first ""jumping"" rollercoasters in Spring 2024.
The ride - named Donkey Kong: Mine Cart Madness - is based on levels from the Donkey Kong video games in which Donkey and Diddy Kong ride a mine cart on tracks that jump over gaps.
In order to recreate this in real life, the rollercoaster's designers have had to use some high-tech engineering in the form of a ""Boom Coaster"".
Universal has publicly shared the schematics - a drawing that shows how a plan might work - and filed a patent - an important legal document that protects people's ideas from being copied - for the new rollercoaster.
The ""Boom Coaster"" design works a bit like an optical illusion. The cart looks as though it is running on rail tracks, but is really being supported by a secret hidden rail underneath.
It produces the illusion that when the tracks run out, the cart looks and feels as though it is leaping over a gap, when it is actually being supported the whole time from underneath.
If that's got you excited for more thrills, then take a look at some other epic rollercoasters below and you can even try out our quiz.

The world record-breaking rollercoaster
How safe are rollercoasters?
The Formula Rossa ride at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi is so fast you need goggles to ride it.
Riders are blasted to 150mph (240kmh) in five seconds.
It's designed to make you feel like a racing driver and the shape of the track was inspired by an Italian racetrack named Autodromo Nazionale Monza.
Formula Rossa has had many famous riders including racing legends Fernando Alonso, Sebastian Vettel and Kimi RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen.
Some of the earliest ideas for rollercoasters came from ice slides in Russia in the 1400s.
Later in 1816, came the ""Montagne Russe"" or ""Russian Mountain"" in Paris, inspired by the Russian ice slides. They were essentially a big slide that passengers would climb to the top of, and ride down in small buggies with wheels.
However, many people agree the world's first ""proper"" rollercoaster opened on 16 June 1884 at Coney Island in New York.
It was called the Switchback Railway and used the same technology as trains do to climb steep hills.
Today's thrill seekers might not have been satisfied with its maximum speed of just six miles per hour.
But the Switchback was an instant success in the US and by the end of the century there were theme parks full of coasters all over America.
The record for the tallest rollercoaster in the world is currently held by Kingda Ka at the Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, US.
At 456 ft (139 m) it's also the second fastest in the world.
A hydraulic launch mechanism powers riders to 128 mph (206 km/h) in three and a half seconds.
But, it might soon be knocked off the top spot by the Falcon's Flight rollercoaster, which is being built in Six Flags Qiddiya, in Saudi Arabia.
Falcon's Flight will measure about 607 feet (185 metres) tall.
The TMNT Shellraiser rollercoaster is the steepest coaster in the world, with a vertical drop of 121.5 degrees.
It can be found in Nickelodeon Universe theme park in New Jersey in the US.
The ride has the same layout as the Takabisha at Fuji-Q Highland in Japan, the previous record holder for world's steepest rollercoaster.
The ride reaches its maximum speed of 62.1 mph in just two seconds.
This is probably the world's slowest rollercoaster - or rather - strollercoaster.
Visitors to the Tiger and Turtle Walking Coaster at Angerpark Duisburg, in Germany, walk themselves around the ride at whatever speed they like!
The Steel Dragon 2000 at Nagashima Spa Land in Kuwana, Japan, is the world's longest coaster.
It spans a lengthy 2.48 km (1.54 miles) and takes four minutes to get round.
That's a quite long time to spend screaming.
However, like Kingda Ka, it might soon be beaten by Falcon's Flight, when that is finally built.
The smallest coaster in the world claims to be the Dvergbanen at Tusenfryd near Oslo, in Norway.
It has a height of just two and a half metres and runs 26 metres in length.
The ideal coaster for anyone who isn't the biggest fan of heights.

The company has said it would like deliveries from Monday to Friday only.
But Downing Street said the government ""would not countenance"" such a move, as a review by regulator Ofcom is looking into the future of the postal service.
""The PM's strong view is that Saturday deliveries provide flexibility and convenience,"" said Rishi Sunak's spokesperson on Monday.
""They are important for businesses and particularly publishers. The Prime Minister would not countenance seeing Saturday deliveries scrapped.""
In response, Royal Mail said it was ""simply not sustainable to maintain a delivery network built for 20 billion letters when we are now only delivering seven billion"".
""We have been consistent in saying the need for reform is urgent to ensure a modern and sustainable universal service,"" it added.
Ofcom, which regulates the postal industry, is set to publish a document outlining options on how Royal Mail can ""evolve to more closely meet consumer needs"".
The regulator has not commented on what the options will be.
Royal Mail posted a Â£319m loss for the first half of the current financial year and the business, which is owned by shareholders, has been calling for urgent reform since 2020.
It has said previously that it would like to go from delivering six days a week to five, from Monday to Friday only.
Ofcom has said that while it will publish options for how the postal service might need to change, it would ""ultimately be for the UK government and Parliament to determine whether any changes are needed to the minimum requirements of the universal service"".
The legal basis for the universal service is the Postal Services Act 2011."
HGH8QIHSBA_P0JYDDJSJSA6C0K,Nikki Haley finally gets her solo showdown with Donald Trump in New Hampshire,By Anthony Zurcher,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68052806,"This video can not be played
Watch: Whatâs at stake for Trump and Haley in New Hampshire?
With Ron DeSantis suspending his presidential campaign on Sunday, Nikki Haley gets the one-on-one match-up with Donald Trump for which she's been longing.
""At one point in this campaign, there were 14 of us running,"" she says in an email fundraising pitch, sent out shortly after the DeSantis news broke.
""But today, it's officially a two-person race between me and Donald Trump!""
Ms Haley's showdown with Mr Trump in the state-by-state contest to choose a Republican presidential candidate may not turn out exactly as she hoped, however. The way the 14-person field has thinned of late has played out mostly to the former president's advantage.
First, Mr DeSantis edged ahead of Ms Haley for second place in Iowa's caucuses, denying her any substantial momentum boost heading into New Hampshire, which votes on Tuesday.
The day after Mr Trump's huge win in Iowa, another presidential rival, Vivek Ramaswamy, withdrew from the race and endorsed Mr Trump, giving him an extra round of headlines.
Now Mr DeSantis is out of the picture, as well. Like Mr Ramaswamy, he has endorsed Mr Trump, although with a bit less fervour. The Florida governor reserved most of his passion for Ms Haley - and not in a good way.
He called the former US ambassador to the UN part of ""the old Republican guard of yesteryear - a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism"". It was a line of attack - Haley the elite-loving globalist - that has been the centrepiece of Mr Trump's attack on his former Cabinet member over the past few days.
It took six days for the DeSantis campaign to churn through the stages of political grief and arrive at acceptance. But his decision to back out when he did, and the way he did, might have helped sealed Mr Trump's victory.

Watch: Highs and lows of Ron DeSantis's presidential bid
Most public-opinion surveys indicate that a clear majority of voters who support Mr DeSantis view Mr Trump as the next best option, suggesting that his withdrawal will end up being a boon to the former president.
A CNN/University of New Hampshire poll released earlier on Sunday, for instance, found 62% of those in the state who backed Mr DeSantis named Mr Trump as their second choice, while only 30% named Ms Haley.
Those aren't great numbers for the former South Carolina governor who has been focusing on New Hampshire for months as the place she believes will give her campaign the boost necessary to seriously challenge Mr Trump.
In theory, her strategy was sound. The state's Republican primary is open to independent voters as well as members of the party, allowing moderates who may not like Mr Trump's brand of conservative populism to have a say. The state also has a higher number of college graduates in its population, 37%, which is one of Ms Haley's strongest demographics.
She's seen her support rise in the state over recent months, as she's become the clear alternative for those who don't favour the former president. There's little doubt she brings the people skills that DeSantis lacked and has also chosen a different path to the former Florida governor, who positioned himself to the right of Mr Trump.
In policy and tone, her campaign has been described as something of a throwback to a pre-Trump era in the Republican Party. There is more compromise in her message and she has largely stayed away from grievance politics and conspiracy theories. And she supports continuing US funding of the Ukraine war.
But not being Trump and delivering a more moderate message may not be enough.
If she fails to beat him in New Hampshire, it is difficult to see where she might prevail - even in her South Carolina home, where the former president is immensely popular and has the support of almost every other state Republican official.
The lament among anti-Trump Republicans has always been that a majority in the party didn't want to see him as the nominee again, but the field against him was simply too divided. If they could only unite behind one candidate, the argument went, victory would be within reach.
In New Hampshire, on Tuesday, that theory will finally be put to the test."

A derelict dry dock on the River Clyde has been given the green light to re-open - 36 years after it closed.
Glasgow City Council has granted a change of use planning consent, which will allow the full re-opening of dry dock number one in Govan.
The dry dock - one of three built between 1869 and 1898 - will operate as a ship repair and maintenance facility, allowing the continuation of work on the steamer TS Queen Mary.
Peter Breslin, managing director of Govan Drydock Limited, said it was great news for the Govan area.

HTVU5QZK54_Q7SOO2PR19G3OXV,Missing Dundee cyclist confirmed dead in Italy cliff fall,_,6 days ago,20231223,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-68057243,"A Scottish cyclist who went missing near Monaco was found dead in Italy, his family has confirmed.
Steven Harper, 38, is believed to have fallen from a cliff near Ventimiglia in November, while attempting to pedal from Dundee to India.
His brother, Dale, said he feared that the dad-of-two had eaten a potentially lethal mushroom after being robbed of his bike and possessions in Nice.
A Foreign Office spokesperson said officials were assisting his family.
Dale, 40, flew out to the south of France after the family received texts from Steven saying he felt ""unwell"" having eaten the fungi while foraging near Roquebrune-Cap-Martin.
He was not informed that his brother's body had been found until late December.
Dale said Italian authorities told him that Steven was seen falling on 23 November, hours after the messages were sent.
Workers on a building site came to his aid and a helicopter carried him from the cliffside overlooking Ventimiglia's harbour.
He was pronounced dead a short time later and his body kept in a morgue in Sanremo.
In statement on social media, he said he was concerned that his brother had made a ""fatal mistake"" by eating dangerous mushrooms, but said it was unclear what kind of fungi he had eaten.
Dale said: ""His death was attributed to a fall from a cliff, possibly due to disorientation caused by mushroom toxins.
""I take comfort in knowing he was doing what he wanted to do, wasn't wanting for anything, was surrounded by people in his last moments in a place he always said he had wanted to die.""
Steven had travelled through Andorra, Spain and France and was understood to be following the Mediterranean route through Europe.
Dale said he had received messages of condolence from ""all over the world"" and the family had been left ""devastated"" by the news.
He added: ""I am proud of him but I am just so broken knowing he's not there any more.
""Anyone that has met Steven or spent time with him will know his free-spirited attitude of 'You can do what you set your mind to'.""

HX2QG5TFH2_NILH6UXQ00S74ML,Amazon fined for 'excessive' surveillance of workers,By Sam Gruet,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68067022,"Amazon has been fined â¬32m (Â£27m) in France for ""excessive"" surveillance of its workers, including measures the data watchdog found to be illegal.
The CNIL said Amazon France Logistique, which manages warehouses, recorded data captured by workers' handheld scanners.
It found Amazon tracked activity so precisely that it led to workers having to potentially justify each break.
Amazon said it strongly disagreed with the CNIL's findings and called them ""factually incorrect"".
France's data protection agency investigated Amazon warehouses following complaints by employees as well as media coverage of conditions.
It outlined a number of areas where it found Amazon had breached General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
This included a system with three alerts in place to monitor employee activity, which the CNIL ruled to be illegal.
One alert triggered if an item was scanned too quickly or less than 1.25 seconds after scanning a previous item, increasing the risk of error.
Another signalled breaks of 10 minutes or more, while a third tracked breaks between one and 10 minutes.
The CNIL also questioned why Amazon needed to keep workers' data for 31 days.
Responding to the findings an Amazon spokesperson said: ""We strongly disagree with the CNIL's conclusions which are factually incorrect and we reserve the right to file an appeal.
""Warehouse management systems are industry standard and are necessary for ensuring the safety, quality, and efficiency of operations and to track the storage of inventory and processing of packages on time and in line with customer expectations.""
A similar system for Amazon warehouses in the UK has been highlighted before.
Amazon's Europe policy chief Brian Palmer told a parliamentary select committee in November 2022 that if an employee had three productivity flags on the system they could be fired. The online giant later said they were not ""fully correct"".
The subsequent report published by the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee raised concerns about surveillance technology being used to set performance targets and monitor performance.
The report said there was evidence to suggest that Amazon's surveillance practices were ""leading to distrust, micromanagement and, in some cases, disciplinary action against its workers"".
The committee said it had written to Amazon outlining its concern the technology would put ""undue stress on its workforce"".
Amazon declined to comment on its UK warehouses.
The CNIL said Amazon already had access to lots of data to achieve quality and safety in its warehouses, and called the system ""excessively intrusive"". It also noted that tracking employees so closely could lead to them having to justify even a brief interruption of scanning.
Amazon also used data collected by the scanner to plan work in its warehouses, evaluate employees on a weekly basis and train them. The watchdog ruled Amazon did not need access to the smallest details of data collected by the scanners to do so.
The online shopping giant was fined for not properly informing workers and external visitors about surveillance, with the watchdog also found to have had insufficient security on its video surveillance.
Reacting to the ruling, the GMB union which represents Amazon's UK warehouse workers, said the company's staff were facing ""bruising levels of scrutiny and surveillance"".

I1CQDQYOKT_RV7GSLQLBS4SJIY,Welsh Labour: Vaughan Gething pledges to expand free childcare,"By Gareth Lewis, Adam Hale & Paul Pigott",1 day ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-68108750,"Vaughan Gething has promised to expand free childcare for families in his bid to become Wales' next first minister.
Mr Gething made the commitment at the launch of his manifesto in Wrexham on Saturday.
He also promised to ease congestion on the M4 corridor, increase the number of apprenticeships and tackle the ""scourge"" of unsafe coal tips.
Mr Gething and Education Minister Jeremy Miles are vying to succeed Mark Drakeford when he steps down in March.
""Welsh Labour has already delivered the best childcare offer in practise in the UK,"" Mr Gething told BBC Radio Wales ahead of the manifesto launch at Coleg Cambria.
He said ""childcare really does matter to working parents"" and that ""not everyone can rely on informal childcare"".
""I want to expand [childcare provision in Wales] so more parents with younger children can access the Childcare Offer,"" he said.
""It does require more resources, it does require a change in the money we receive, and that requires a change at the UK level.""
The Welsh government has faced calls to bring its childcare plans into line with the UK government's in England.
If he becomes first minister, Mr Gething also pledged to make infrastructure improvements to ease congestion along the M4 corridor.
He said he would strengthen transport links across south east Wales by delivering on a 2020 report, commissioned by the Welsh government, that recommended an Â£800m investment in public transport.
Speaking at the launch, he said he wanted to get the public more engaged on issues like transport.
""I actually think it's really important for the public to have greater engagement in why we're designing a different future, to both meet the challenges of climate change, but also our social challenges and how we feel connected around the world that we live in, and of course, for the future of the economy,"" he said.
""So I think it's really important that with more engagement that we have to show that we are listening to people, I think that really matters.""
He made a number of other promises in his manifesto, including to increase the number of apprenticeships - the funding for which has recently been cut.
He also pledged to do everything in his power to tackle the ""scourge"" of Wales' 2,500 disused coal tips, one in seven of which is deemed high risk.
His manifesto also included a commitment to accelerate the building of social housing, but did not set a target.
And there was a pledge to create a ""fully functioning environmental governance body""  to hold the Welsh government to account on things like sewage spills.
Mr Gething said he would also prioritise money from the UK Shared Prosperity Fund (UKSPF) - which replaces the money Wales previously received from the EU - into apprenticeships to boost job prospects and the Welsh economy.
He said he had secured a ""commitment"" from UK Labour that a future government led by Sir Keir Starmer would ""repatriate"" the funding to the Welsh government.
Jeremy Miles will launch his manifesto this week, with the winner to be announced on 16 March.
Mr Miles has won the backing of most of Welsh Labour's Senedd politicians in the party's leadership contest.
But he hit out on Friday after Wales' largest trade union Unite announced it was backing Mr Gething - after deeming Mr Miles ""ineligible"" because he had not ""held elected lay office as representatives of workers"".

I39W3PFQV1_0MVLITWNY00B48Q,US regulator admits cyber-security lapse before rogue Bitcoin post,By Tom Gerken,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68025683,"The US financial regulator has confirmed a key security procedure on its X account had been suspended for six months when hackers made a fake post about Bitcoin in January.
The cryptocurrency surged in value before the post was deleted.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) did not have multi-factor authentication (MFA) in place when hackers gained access to the account.
Cyber-security experts say it should be a wake-up call for other agencies.
""While the SEC's X account hack is a minor security incident, all governmental agencies should review the security of their social network accounts,"" said Ilia Kolochenko from cyber-firm ImmuniWeb.
He pointed out that a similar incident at a body such as the US Department of Defense could have more ""devastating consequences"".
""While MFA had previously been enabled on the @SECGov X account, it was disabled by X Support, at the staff's request, in July 2023 due to issues accessing the account,"" the SEC said in a statement.
""Once access was re-established, MFA remained disabled until staff re-enabled it after the account was compromised on January 9.
""MFA currently is enabled for all SEC social media accounts that offer it.""
The SEC has confirmed the account was compromised by a fraudster convincing a mobile operator to transfer an SEC employee's phone number to a new Sim.
The employee who was targeted had their phone number associated with the SEC's account for X, formerly known as Twitter.
Because MFA had been suspended on the account, the hacker was able to reset the password, log in and make a post.
It announced the SEC had approved so-called exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Bitcoin, which shot up in value to $48,000 (Â£37,800) before the post was withdrawn.
Though the SEC has subsequently confirmed the regulatory change, the cryptocurrency fell to just over $38,600 on Tuesday, its lowest value in 2024 so far.
In a Sim-swapping attack, typically a hacker will call a mobile phone operator claiming they have lost the phone they are targeting and need a new Sim card sent out to them.
Sometimes, the hackers will go into a store in person to carry out the con.
MFA is intended to protect against this kind of hack.
It takes many forms, including having a dedicated app that gives you a pin code for a website, as well as sending a text message, though this is considered less secure.
If the verification a person chooses is to receive a text confirming they are the user, a person who has gained access to their phone number will receive the text message instead.
Because of this, experts advise people to use a dedicated app for verification instead.

I7BDI6RB9C_F8U7W291TFIGK1W,Canada's use of emergency powers 'unjustified' - judge,_,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68038172,"A federal judge has ruled that Canada's use of emergency powers to end the anti-government Freedom Convoy protests two years ago was ""unreasonable"" and unjustified.
In a decision on Tuesday, Judge Richard Mosley also said it violated Canada's rights charter.
The federal government said it will appeal the decision.
The Emergencies Act bestows the government with added powers in times of crisis.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked it on 14 February 2022, three weeks into protests that gridlocked the capital.
Dubbed the ""Freedom Convoy"", the protest against the government's Covid-19 vaccine mandate gained international attention as hundreds of demonstrators settled in for weeks around Ottawa's Parliament Hill, many in trucks.
Shorter protests and blockades also cropped up at various border points across the country.
The emergency powers allowed the government to impose bans on public assembly in some areas and to prohibit travel to protest zones, including by foreign nationals, among other measures.
In Tuesday's decision, Judge Mosely wrote: ""I have concluded that the decision to issue the proclamation does not bear the hallmarks of reasonableness - justification, transparency and intelligibility - and was not justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that were required to be taken into consideration.""
The court case was brought by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the Canadian Constitution Foundation.
They had argued that the protests did not meet the ""high legal threshold"" needed to invoke the act, which was being used for the first time since it became law in 1988.
Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland defended the government's actions on Tuesday, arguing that the country at the time faced a threat to its national and economic security and it was a ""option of the last resort"".
""We acted to secure and protect Canada and to secure and protect the national interests,"" she told reporters in Montreal.
""It was not an easy time, these were not easy decisions.""
Last year, a federal inquiry into the use of the act found that Canada's government had met the ""high threshold"" for its use.
Justice Paul Rouleau, who led that probe, called the decision a ""drastic move"" but not a ""dictatorial one"".
""Lawful protest descended into lawlessness, culminating in a national emergency,"" Mr Rouleau wrote in his Public Order Emergency Commission report, issued in February 2023.

NHS Highland said new capital projects, including the replacement for the Belford Hospital in Fort William, were now on hold.
Former Highland Council leader Michael Foxley, who has campaigned for almost 20 years for a new hospital, described the news as âdepressingâ.

IIFFHT8M00_DB4BKX0IQVVK9CI,Kenneth Eugene Smith: Alabama carries out first nitrogen gas execution,_,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68085513,"Alabama has executed convicted murderer Kenneth Eugene Smith with nitrogen gas, the first time the method of capital punishment has been used globally.
A witness told the BBC that Smith thrashed violently on the gurney and the execution took around 25 minutes.
The UN condemned it on Friday as cruel but Alabama said the process had been carried out humanely.
Smith was convicted in 1989 of murdering a preacher's wife, Elizabeth Sennett, in a killing-for-hire.
In his final words, the 58-year-old said his death would mean Alabama had taken humanity ""a step backwards"".
Mike Sennett, the son of the victim, said the family wouldn't be celebrating but that Smith had paid his ""debt"".
""Nothing that happened here today is going to bring Mom back,"" he said, adding: ""We're glad this day is over"".
According to the Death Penalty Information Center, Smith is the first person to be put to death using pure nitrogen gas anywhere in the world.
The execution began at 19:53 local time (01:53 GMT) and he was pronounced dead at 20:25 (02:35 GMT).
Alabama and two other US states have approved the use of nitrogen hypoxia as an alternative method of execution because the drugs used in lethal injections have become more difficult to find, contributing to a fall in the use of the death penalty nationally.
""Tonight Alabama causes humanity to take a step backwards,"" Smith said, according to witnesses. ""Thank you for supporting me. Love all of you.""
After the gas began to flow into his mask, the inmate is said to have smiled, nodded toward his family and signed ""I love you"".
One of the five members of the media transported to Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore to witness the execution told the BBC it was unlike any other he'd witnessed in Alabama.
""I've been to four previous executions and I've never seen a condemned inmate thrash in the way that Kenneth Smith reacted to the nitrogen gas,"" Lee Hedgepeth told the BBC's Newsday programme.
""Kenny just began to gasp for air repeatedly and the execution took about 25 minutes total.""
Breathing nitrogen without oxygen causes cells in the body to break down and leads to death.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, who did not respond to a request to attend the execution, confirmed Smith's death in a statement.
""After more than 30 years and attempt after attempt to game the system, Mr Smith has answered for his horrendous crimes,"" she said.
""I pray that Elizabeth Sennett's family can receive closure after all these years dealing with that great loss.""
Attorney General Steve Marshall said it had proved to be ""an effective and humane method of execution"", refuting the ""dire predictions"" of activists and the media.
""Justice has been served,"" his statement added.
Alabama corrections Commissioner John Hamm said Smith's shaking on the gurney appeared to be involuntary movements.

Watch: How nitrogen became a form of execution in the US
""That was all expected and was in the side effects that we've seen or researched on nitrogen hypoxia,"" Mr Hamm said. ""Nothing was out of the ordinary from what we were expecting.""
Alabama said in an earlier court filing that it expected Smith to lose consciousness within seconds and die in a matter of minutes.
Smith was one of two men convicted of murdering Mrs Sennett in a $1,000 (Â£790) killing-for-hire in March 1988.
The 45-year-old was beaten with a fireplace implement and stabbed in the chest and neck, and her death was staged to look like a home invasion and burglary.
Her husband Charles Sennett, a debt-ridden preacher, had orchestrated the scheme to collect insurance money. He killed himself as investigators closed in.
Smith's fellow hitman, John Forrest Parker, was executed in 2010.
At his trial Smith admitted to being present when the victim was killed, but said he did not take part in the attack.
The jury that convicted him had voted in favour of a life sentence but the judge overrruled them and imposed a capital punishment. The law has been changed since to prevent a judge intervening like that.
In a statement, Smith's legal team said it was ""deeply saddened"" by his execution, noting that the jury in his case had voted to spare his life but a judge overrode that decision.
""Nothing can undo the tragic consequences of the actions for which he was convicted, including the pain of the Sennett family and friends,"" the attorneys said.
""Kenny's life, however, should be considered in its full context.""
Earlier on Thursday, the Alabama Department of Corrections shared details from the inmate's final 48 hours.

Mike Sennett, son of murder victim Elizabeth Sennett, says Smith has ""paid his debt""
Smith was visited by members of his family, two friends, his spiritual adviser and his attorney. His final meal was steak and eggs with hash browns.
Alabama tried to execute Smith by lethal injection two years ago, but they were unable to find a vein before the state's death warrant expired.
On Thursday night, the Supreme Court denied him a last-minute reprieve. Three liberal justices dissented from the conservative-led majority's ruling.Â
""Having failed to kill Smith on its first attempt, Alabama has selected him as its 'guinea pig' to test a method of execution never tested before,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote. ""The world is watching.""
The nitrogen execution had been denounced by some medical professionals, who warned it could cause a range of catastrophic mishaps, ranging from violent convulsions to survival in a vegetative state.
Last week, the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights urged a halt to the execution, saying that gassing Smith could amount to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment under international human rights law.

IIWNXYJPMX_LYG3PZJ2ZGFGA4X,Bola Tinubu denies planning to move Nigeria's capital from Abuja to Lagos,By Mansur Abubakar,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-68092177,"Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu has no plans to move the country's capital from Abuja to Lagos, his office says.
The presidency blamed political opponents for such rumours, saying ""there is no iota of truth"" in them.
The speculation began before Mr Tinubu, who once served as governor of Lagos, took power last May.
It reached fever pitch this week after it was announced that the airports agency and a central bank department were moving to Lagos.
Abuja replaced Lagos as Nigeria's capital in 1991. It was a purpose-built, planned city - its location chosen because it is in the centre of the country, while Lagos is on the south-west coast.
Lagos, the capital during British colonial rule, remains the country's economic hub and biggest city.
The presidency said it had decided to issue a statement to scotch the rumours about relocating the capital as ""mischief-makers"" seemed bent on ""fuelling needless ethnic mistrust"".
""The people pushing the relocation narrative are playing dangerous politics, to pit the north against the south,"" said Bayo Onanuga, a presidential adviser who issued the statement.
Nigeria is split between the mainly Muslim north and largely Christian south - though Africa's most-populous nation has more than 250 ethnic groups speaking more 500 distinct languages.
There are three main groups: Hausa in the north, Yoruba in the west and Igbo in the east.
In recent years some figures from the south-west region surrounding Lagos have been calling for a separate Yoruba nation - though it is not regarded as a serious threat.
Because Mr Tinubu is from the Yoruba community, some fear that he would like to move the capital as part of a plan to favour the south-west over the rest of the country.
But this was denied by his adviser.
""President Tinubu-led administration is working tirelessly to be just and equitable to every section of the country,"" Mr Onanuga said.
The relocation of the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (Faan) and the Central Bank of Nigeria's banking supervision department to Lagos was purely administrative, he added.

State media said the fire started on Wednesday afternoon local time in the city in Jiangxi province.
Footage from state-backed Global Times showed smoke billowing from buildings and people jumping from windows. The video has not been verified by the BBC.
President Xi Jinping has called for an investigation into the blaze.
He also demanded the ""resolute containment"" of similar deadly incidents in the country.
Wednesday's fire comes days after 13 children died when a fire broke out in a school dormitory in the central Henan province. Seven members of staff were later arrested by police.
In November, 26 people died and dozens were sent to hospital after a fire at a coal company office in northern China's Shanxi province.
The month before, an explosion at a barbecue restaurant in north-western China left 31 dead and prompted official pledges of a nationwide campaign to promote workplace safety.
And last April, a hospital fire in Beijing killed 29 people and forced desperate survivors to jump out of windows to escape.

IOFFF8S5F9_L5SMR7DXAGWJG7P,Simon Clarke's call for Rishi Sunak to go sparks backlash,By Sam Francis,4 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68077142,"A senior Tory MP has called for his party to replace Rishi Sunak as prime minister or be ""massacred"" in the general election.
Writing in the Telegraph, former cabinet minister Sir Simon Clarke said the Conservatives had lost ""key voters"" by failing to be bold on immigration.
But his article was criticised by several other ex-ministers.
Former Home Secretary Dame Priti Patel accused Sir Simon of ""engaging in facile and divisive self indulgence"".
And Sir David Davis, a former Brexit secretary, said: ""The party and the country are sick and tired of MPs putting their own leadership ambitions ahead of the UK's best interests.""
Lee Anderson, who joined Sir Simon in rebelling over the Rwanda Bill last week, said there was ""no chance"" of Mr Sunak being removed before the next election.
He urged his colleagues to get behind the PM, telling the Telegraph ""our only chance to win the next election is by keeping Rishi in No 10"".
Home Secretary James Cleverly said he ""could not disagree with [Sir Simon] more on this particular issue"".
He argued Mr Sunak was succeeding in his attempts to cut inflation and reduce the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats.
""If we were to do something as foolish as have an internal argument at this stage, all it would do is open the door for Keir Starmer,"" he said.
Sir Simon denied he was ""positioning myself or on behalf of another"".
""I am speaking out because the stakes for our country and my party are too high to stay silent,"" the MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland added.
A general election is expected in the second half of this year, with 28 January 2025 the latest date one could legally be held.
Sir Simon is now the second former minister publicly calling for Mr Sunak to resign. Former education minister Dame Andrea Jenkyns submitted a letter of no confidence in the prime minister in November.
After serving as chief secretary to the Treasury while Mr Sunak was chancellor, Sir Simon became an enthusiastic supporter of Liz Truss's leadership bid and joined her cabinet.

Rishi Sunak is asked by the Labour leader why his own MPs consider him an ""obstacle to recovery"".
A source close to Ms Truss said she ""had no idea what Simon Clarke is/was up to and is in no way supportive of what he is saying"".
Conservative MPs can only trigger a leadership election if 53 MPs write to the chair of the 1922 Committee requesting one.
In his Telegraph op-ed, Sir Simon said ""the Conservative Party under Rishi Sunak once again stands on the opposite, crumbling bank of this widening precipice"".
The former levelling up secretary said Tory MPs might be ""afraid"" of electing a fourth leader in two years but asked: ""Which is worse: a week of chaotic headlines in Westminster, or a decade of decline under Keir?""
Sir Simon's comments come after a week of open rebellion against Mr Sunak over his flagship Rwanda Bill, which aims to deter migrants from crossing the Channel in small boats.
Last week 61 Conservative MPs voted to change the bill as it went through Parliament - the biggest rebellion of Mr Sunak's premiership.
In the end their attempts failed and only 11, including Sir Simon, voted against the bill as a whole.
But debate over the legislation exposed ongoing divisions within the party, with two deputy chairmen, Mr Anderson and Brendan Clarke-Smith, quitting their roles in order to vote for changes.
It is not anticipated that two of the most prominent rebels - former Home Secretary Suella Braverman and former Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick - are about to join calls for the PM to go.
However, Mr Sunak's critics say discontent with his leadership extends beyond the Rwanda rebels.
During Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Sunak of ""endlessly fighting with his own MPs"".
""We have seen this story time and time again with this lot, party first, country second,"" he said.
""The country forced to endure their division and chaos, the longest episode of Eastenders ever put to film.""
Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper said it was ""utterly ludicrous that the Conservative Party is even discussing installing a fourth prime minister without giving voters a say"".
Mr Sunak is the third Conservative prime minister since the 2019 election, after MPs deposed both Boris Johnson and Liz Truss in 2022.
There has been a sense of gloom among Conservatives over the past few weeks as Mr Sunak's repeated attempts to gain the upper hand politically have failed to make a dent in their standing, with the party trailing Labour by 18 points in polls.
A general election poll of 14,000 people by YouGov projected Labour was on course for a 120-seat majority as things stand.
If accurate, the poll would mean ""more Tory seats being lost than in 1997, the Red Wall being wiped out completely and shocking defeats in historic Tory constituencies like Chichester, Horsham and Banbury,"" Sir Simon said."
ISO4E1SIKN_LUKQ3YDHXNYD58X,Burns Night: Who was Robert Burns and why do we celebrate his work?,_,22 January 2024,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3g2jr027l8o,"Robert Burns died in 1796, at the age of 37
Burns Night is celebrated every year on 25 January in honour of Scotland's national poet, Robert Burns.
The Ayrshire poet and lyricist died in 1796, at the age of 37, but he is still regarded as the most prominent poet to have written in the Scots dialect.
His most well-known poems include To a Mouse, Address to a Haggis, Tam O'Shanter, A Red, Red Rose and The Selkirk Grace.
Alongside his literary contributions, Burns gained fame for his numerous love affairs and radical political leanings, expressing sympathy for the French and American revolutions.
A traditional Burns supper of haggis, neeps and tatties
Burns Night, or Burns Supper, is traditionally celebrated with a dinner consisting of haggis, neeps, and tatties, external - more commonly known as turnips and potatoes.
On the 21 July 1801, the fifth anniversary of his death, his friends gathered at what is now called Burns Cottage in Alloway, near Ayr, where he was born, to honour his memory.
During this gathering, they read aloud some of his works and poetry. One poem, 'Address to a Haggis,' was recited as they dined on haggis and a sheep's head.
Unbeknown to them, this event marked the beginning of a tradition that has endured for 200 years and continues to be celebrated today.
In the years following, Burns clubs started to emerge across Scotland to celebrate his life.
The Selkirk Grace is often said before tucking into haggis, neeps and tatties
In 1802, the celebration was shifted from the date of Burns' death to his birth date.
However, they initially got the date wrong, meeting four days after his actual birth.
It wasn't until the following year, in 1803, when members of what is known as the 'Mother Club', the Greenock Burns Club, discovered through Ayr parish records that his true birth date was 25 January.
This date has been celebrated with Burns Suppers for more than 200 years.
Burns' birthplace, Burns Cottage, in Alloway, is now a museum
Burns started life in Alloway, South Ayrshire, in 1759, the eldest of seven children born to William Burns and Agnes Broun, from a relatively poor farming family.
He began working in the fields at a young age and by 15, he had become the primary labourer. His farming upbringing is why he is often referred to as the ploughman's poet.
His father, a self-educated man, decided to home-school his children with the help of tutors.
It was during these formative years that Burns made his initial attempts at writing poetry for various friends and in pursuit of women.
As he matured, he had a growing interest in poetry, nature, women, and drinking - rather than farm work - much to his father's dismay.
Statues of Robert Burns can be found all across Scotland and the world
Burns was known to have had many affairs throughout his life.
In 1785, his affair with a servant girl named Elizabeth Paton, resulted in an illegitimate child.
Jean Armour, a woman who became a constant presence in his life, became pregnant the following year.
Burns sought permission to marry her but Jean's father refused.
Annoyed by this, Burns planned to travel to Jamaica with another woman named Mary Campbell, who tragically died shortly after.
She is more commonly known today as Highland Mary.
After Mary's death, Burns still attempted to gather funds to leave for Jamaica.
However, in 1786, he published his first collection titled 'Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect', widely known as the Kilmarnock edition.
These poems garnered rapid success, making him known across Scotland.
He postponed his intended trip to Jamaica.
Burns spent the last years of his life in Dumfries
An Edinburgh edition of Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish dialect brought more fame, money and an entrance into polite society.
He was received as an equal by the city's men of letters and was a guest at aristocratic gatherings.
In 1788, Burns moved to Dumfries, where he leased a farm, external, and married Jean Armour.
But the poet was leading a double life.
He engaged in correspondence and produced poems and songs with individuals who were considered socially superior, all the while working as a tenant farmer and an exciseman.
Plans to turn farm built by Burns into a visitor attraction
His outspoken support for the French revolution nearly cost him his job, as he openly expressed his pro-revolutionary views.
He died in 1796 after his health had rapidly declined.
On the day of his funeral, Jean Armour gave birth to his final son, Maxwell.
He left behind five surviving children out of the 12 born, along with his wife.
When she died 38 years later in 1834, she was buried next to him.
Auld Lang Syne is traditionally sung to bid farewell to the old year
His life is remembered and celebrated worldwide, as his work inspired generations of Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
His musical compositions have become integral to traditions worldwide.
Auld Lang Syne, which Burns based on an older Scottish folk song, is traditionally sung to bid farewell to the old year at the stroke of midnight on Hogmanay (New Year's Eve)/Hogmanay.

The melody of ""Auld Lang Syne"" is played worldwide at various events, each carrying different cultural significance.

IV62G4PP9N_WUVX7A7DWMBP15G,Child poverty: New Welsh plan criticised for lacking targets,By Daniel Davies,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-68056286,"Wales' children's commissioner and children's rights groups say they are ""deeply disappointed"" by a Welsh government plan to tackle poverty.
In a new strategy, the governments says it wants to reduce costs and help family incomes go as far as possible.
But commissioner Rocio Cifuentes and charities say the document lacks targets.
The Labour minister in charge, Jane Hutt, said they were measuring progress through existing plans.
She said it is ""very difficult to have simplistic targets unless you have full levers over social security and tax"".
First Minister Mark Drakeford said his government would use all its powers to help children, but incomes were affected by key decisions on tax and welfare that are taken in Westminster.
But the UK government said ministers in Cardiff retained ""significant powers to help reduce poverty"".
In Wales 28% of children are considered to be living in relative poverty - with a household classed as such if it is getting by on less than 60% of the UK's median income.
That works out as an income of less than Â£300 a week, after paying for housing costs.
A previous target to eradicate child poverty in Wales by 2020 was dropped by the Welsh government in 2016.
Its new strategy promises to ""put in place robust monitoring and accountability mechanisms to track progress against key indicators on child poverty"".
Alison Westwood runs Baobab Bach, which has community pantries in Bridgend county. Members pay Â£5 for a bag of shopping that would otherwise cost a lot more in a supermarket.
""A lot of people are struggling at the moment with the heat or eat conundrum,"" she said.
""We find when we go to people's houses to deliver it's quite common that they come to the door in their outdoor clothes because they simply can't afford to put the heating on.
""You can see the clouds of the breath in the air and you know the house is completely unheated.""
In a joint statement, a number of children's groups - which include Action for Children and Barnardo's - said they were ""deeply disappointed that ministers have not listened to our calls for a robust action plan with measurable targets"".
""Whilst we welcome the government's explicit reference to children's rights and a children's rights approach within this revised strategy, there is a fundamental aspect missing - accountability,"" they said in the statement.
They added that without a monitoring framework ""we will not be able to determine whether public money being spent in Wales is reaching those children whose lives are being so severely affected"".
Among the signatories was the Children's Commissioner for Wales Ms Cifuentes.
The comments follow criticism of a draft strategy last year which the children's commissioner said lacked ""ambition, clarity and detail"".
The draft document attacked the Conservatives, saying that ""what those children who live in poverty in Wales need is a change of UK government"".
A lot of that criticism has been dropped from the Welsh government's final document.
The draft strategy also called on the UK government to reverse some benefits decisions, including the two-child limit for some payments - but that call is not in the final strategy.
Ms Hutt said the government was measuring progress through existing plans.
""You don't want a whole load of other targets. You've got to focus on what we have in Wales today which is really powerful - our Wellbeing of Future Generations Act,"" she added.
""We want to end child poverty in Wales and we are measuring ourselves against this Wellbeing of Future Generations Act.""
A Conservative UK government spokesperson said there were ""1.7 million fewer people in absolute poverty in the UK than 2010, including 400,000 fewer children"".
They added: ""The UK government is continuing to support the most vulnerable including through Cost of Living Payments worth an average Â£3,700 per household and raising benefits by 6.7% this April.""
Mark Isherwood, Welsh Conservative spokesman for social justice, told Radio Wales Breakfast child poverty was rising before the Conservatives came to power in Westminster.
""The rise in child poverty in Wales didn't start in 2010, it started in the years before the credit crunch and recession in 2008,"" he said.
""In 2008 it reached the highest level in the UK at 32%. So this is a longstanding story.""
He added his party had been ""calling for this revised strategy for years and years"".
Plaid Cymru spokesperson for social justice, Sioned Williams, said: ""After 25 years in power in Wales, it's hard to accept the narrative that tackling child poverty is an absolute priority for the Labour government. But without real action, their words ring hollow.""
Ministers lack ambition on child poverty, say MSs

IVOG8XGW20_TN9P4D4QLDZ3P1V,"Baby could have lived with earlier hospital care, inquiry told",By Georgina Hayes,6 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-68060985,"A baby who died hours after being born could have survived had her mother been told to attend hospital earlier, a Fatal Accident Inquiry has heard.
Ellie McCormick died at Wishaw General Hospital on 5 March 2019.
Glasgow Sheriff Court heard that had her mother Nicola been induced ""at any time prior to labour commencing"" Ellie would likely have lived.
The FAI is looking into the deaths of three babies at two North Lanarkshire hospitals between 2019 and 2021.
In the first day of evidence about Ellie's death, a joint minute read at court stated: ""Had Ms McCormick been advised to attend hospital during her call at 16.29 on 4 March 2019 or at any time earlier it is likely Ellie would have survived.""
A decision was made to perform an emergency caesarean section after Ellie's heartbeat in the womb was noted to be low.
She died from a lack of oxygen five hours later.
It was noted that she was unresponsive with multi-organ failure, so a decision had been taken for active care to be withdrawn.
A review by NHS Lanarkshire at the time identified ""major care issues"" around Ellie and her mother.
It stated that a different plan for Ellie's birth would have ""on the balance of probability"" brought a more ""favourable outcome"".
The FAI heard that Nicola McCormick was a high-risk pregnancy due to her obesity, so was placed under joint consultant and midwife care.
She had reported bleeding and two episodes of reduced foetal movement during her pregnancy.
But the inquiry was told that the IT system used for maternity care had not automatically highlighted these incidents to midwives or doctors.
The Badgernet system had been rolled out in Lanarkshire in 2016 to replace paper notes.
Clinical negligence lawyer Darren Deery put it to a midwife involved in Ms McCormick's care that there had been no reliable IT mechanism to alert her to developing risk factors.
The midwife agreed and said that Badgernet had not highlighted the high-risk pregnancy or history of bleeding.
The inquiry also heard that Ms McCormick's midwife was changed late in the pregnancy.
Mr Deery put it to the second midwife that she was given no proper handover and also had no opportunity to be aware of these incidents.
The second midwife said the Badgernet system would have required her to read the notes of every single one of Ms McCormick's previous appointments, but time constraints meant this was not possible for every patient.
The court heard how Badgernet - used to highlight risks and conduct risk assessments - has since been changed.
The FAI is also looking into the deaths of Mirabelle Bosch and Leo Lamont.
Leo Lamont was two hours old when he died at Monklands Hospital on 15 February 2019.
Mirabelle Bosch died on 2 July 2021 at Wishaw General Hospital, 12 hours after her birth.
The inquiry before Sheriff Principal Aisha Anwar continues.

IWMV11SFV7_IG0APGBCU9LOLHZ,Carl Fullard killing: John Blanchard jailed for one-punch manslaughter,By Kevin Shoesmith,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-68057573,"A ""jealous"" man who killed another man with a single punch in Hull city centre has been jailed.
Carl Fullard, 44, died from his injuries after being attacked near G.W. Horners pub in Anlaby Road, on 9 September 2023.
After admitting manslaughter at Hull Crown Court, John Blanchard, 40, was sentenced to six years and eight months' imprisonment on Friday.
Mr Fullard had a ""heart of gold"", his family said.
After sentencing, Det Ch Insp Jayne Goodens, who led the investigation, said an ""unsuspecting"" Mr Fullard was followed by Blanchard who, ""in a jealous-fuelled rage"", punched him in the head, causing him to collapse and go into cardiac arrest.
Mr Fullard suffered what police described as ""a catastrophic bleed to the brain"".
Ms Goodens thanked members of the public who performed CPR on Mr Fullard until the arrival of the emergency services. Mr Fullard died later in hospital.
According to Ms Goodens, Blanchard, of St Paul's Street, Hull, had been unable to bear the thought that his former partner had moved on.
He had chosen to take out his resentment on an innocent man, ""ending his life with a single punch"", she said.
The senior officer praised Mr Fullard's family for their patience and bravery during the police investigation.
She added: ""Whilst the result cannot take away the pain and suffering caused, I hope that it provides them with some peace, and even just a small sense of justice that John Blanchard has taken responsibility by pleading guilty, and will spend time in prison.""
Ms Goodens said in the past two years six men in the force area had fallen victim to one-punch killings.
She added: ""We encourage people to stop, think, and just walk away. No argument or disagreement is worth a life without a loved one. One moment of madness. One spontaneous act of rage. Multiple lives destroyed.""
Paying tribute to her son, Mr Fullard's mother Julie said: ""You will always be missed and [it is] a tragedy that you went this way, rest in peace my son.""
Mr Fullard's sister Lesley added: ""You were a loving and caring brother and had a heart of gold, we will miss you so much.""

IXYNI3Q3SO_KLEQRILHWC4QT46,Venezuelan opposition denounces 'intimidation' attempts,By Vanessa BuschschlÃ¼ter,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-68081038,"Venezuelan opposition leader MarÃ­a Corina Machado has denounced what she says are attempts by the government to intimidate her and her supporters.
She said two campaign co-ordinators had been ""abducted"" and party offices had been vandalised.
The incidents come just months after the government agreed to a deal laying the groundwork for free and fair elections to be held in 2024.
Ms Machado said Tuesday's incidents violated that deal.
Under the agreement, which was reached in Barbados in October last year, the government of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro committed to allowing international observers to monitor the presidential poll, which is scheduled for a yet-to-be-determined date in the second half of 2024.
The 2018 election, which saw President Maduro win a second term in office, was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair.
As part of the Barbados deal, his government also promised to guarantee that all candidates would be able to freely and safely move throughout the country.
In return, the United States, which backed the Barbados talks, eased some of the sanctions it had imposed on Venezuela's oil sector.
However, just three months after the agreement was struck, tension between the opposition and the government is again on the rise.
On Monday, Venezuela's Attorney-General Tarek William Saab, a close ally of President Maduro, announced that 32 people had been arrested for allegedly plotting to assassinate the president and Venezuela's defence minister, Vladimir Padrino.
Mr Saab also said that arrest warrants had been issued for another 14 suspects, among them human rights activist Tamara SujÃº and journalist Sebastiana BarrÃ¡ez, who both live outside of Venezuela and have been highly critical of the government.
Tension also seems to be on the rise again with the United States, with Mr Padrino claiming that the alleged plot to kill him and the president had the backing of the CIA and the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
The US state department said on Tuesday it was ""deeply concerned"" by Monday's arrests.
""Actions that run counter to the spirit and the letter of the Barbados Agreement will have consequences,"" state department spokesman Matthew Miller warned.
Meanwhile, rival groups of supporters took to the streets of the capital Caracas on Tuesday.
President Maduro appeared to goad his followers when he told them, invoking independence hero Simon BolÃ­var: ""If the fascists ever hurt me (...), I leave it to you to do what you have to do to restore justice and peace in Venezuela. Activate the Bolivarian fury!""
Graffiti appeared later on the pavement in front of MarÃ­a Corina Machado's campaign headquarters reading ""Bolivarian fury"".
The whereabouts of two of her campaign co-ordinators are unknown after video showed men seizing them and taking them away in unmarked cars.
Ms Machado asked for help from the international community, telling them that ""we must put a stop to this madness because this is what the Bolivarian fury means: aggression, disappearances, persecution"".
The 56-year-old politician overwhelmingly won an opposition primary held in October despite being banned from running for office.
She has appealed against the ban, which she has always maintained was unfair and designed to keep the opposition down.
Mr Maduro has not yet announced whether he will stand for re-election or if his party will put forward a different candidate.

IYHDCDBVZI_7S6J891GFNOXP7E,Houthis attack British-linked tanker Marlin Luanda in Gulf of Aden,By James Gregory,1 day ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68110358,"A tanker with links to the UK was on fire for several hours in the Gulf of Aden after being hit by a missile fired by the Houthis.
The Iran-backed movement, based in Yemen, said it targeted the Marlin Luanda on Friday in response to ""American-British aggression"".
The US and UK have launched air strikes on Houthi targets in response to attacks on ships in the Red Sea region.
French, Indian and US naval ships provided assistance to the vessel.
UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps called the attack ""intolerable and illegal.""
""It is our duty to protect freedom of navigation in the Red Sea and we remain as committed to that cause as ever,"" he said on X.
The operator of the Marlin Luanda is registered as being Oceonix Services Ltd, a UK registered company.
The tanker flies under the flag of the Marshall Islands and is operated on behalf of Trafigura - a multinational trading company.
In an update on Saturday, Trafigura said all crew were safe and that the fire in a cargo tank had been put out. The ship was now sailing towards a safe harbour, the company said.
The US Central Command (Centcom) said there were no casualties on the tanker, which was made up of 22 Indian and 1 Bangladeshi crew members.
It is the latest attack on commercial shipping by the Houthis in and around the Red Sea. The group says it is targeting vessels in the region in support of Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel is fighting Hamas.
In a statement, a Houthi spokesperson claimed the Marlin Luanda was a British ship and was targeted in response to ""American-British aggression against our country"".
The UK government said attacks on commercial shipping are ""completely unacceptable"" and that Britain and its allies ""reserve the right to respond appropriately"".
The US Central Command said ""these unlawful actions have nothing to do with the conflict in Gaza"".
""Neither the vessel nor its crew have any affiliation to Israel. The Houthis have fired indiscriminately into the Red Sea, targeting vessels impacting over 40 countries around the world,"" Centcom said in a statement.
The UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said the incident happened 60 nautical miles south-east of Aden.
It warned other vessels to transit with caution and report any suspicious activity.
Later, Centcom said its forces had conducted a strike at 03:45 local time (00:45 GMT) on Saturday ""against a Houthi anti-ship missile aimed into the Red Sea and which was prepared to launch"". They ""destroyed the missile in self-defence"", Centcom said.
Since November, the Houthis have launched dozens of attacks on commercial vessels travelling through the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.

IYN32TJZM6_GUEIWY4TMY66WNN,Pembrokeshire couple died in mystery house fire - inquest,By Aled Scourfield,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-68094249,"A married couple died in a house fire, the cause of which remains a mystery, an inquest has heard.
David Bowen Edwards, 60, was the main carer for his wife Margaret Eleanor Edwards, 55, who had mobility issues and slept downstairs in a medical bed.
The couple - described as being devoted to each other - were found dead at home in St Dogmaels, Pembrokeshire, in the early hours of 11 December 2022.
The inquest heard an investigator could not be certain what started the fire.
A hearing in Haverfordwest was told the couple met 35 years ago and had been married for 18 years.
Police were called to their small terraced house on a narrow street in St Dogmaels which was said to be ""well alight"".
Coroner's officer, PC James Lang-Ford said flames were coming through the roof and police had to force the front door open.
Mrs Edwards was found in an armchair and was pronounced dead just after 02:30 after unsuccessful attempts at CPR.
Her husband's body was recovered a few hours later from a downstairs room - it is believed the bed containing Mr Edwards fell from the first floor as it collapsed.
A post-mortem examination found Mr Edwards died as the result of burns while his wife died as the result of carbon monoxide poisoning.
A fire investigation report, read by fire scene investigator Stephen Christopher Rowlands, said it was a ""very, very cold evening"" and the retained crew responded ""slower than normal"" because of the conditions.
Crews managed to make it to the first floor, but had to withdraw because of the ferocity of the fire shortly before the floor collapsed.
Mr Rowlands explained that a finger tip search was carried out and a number of items were examined, including cable reels, hair straighteners, and the gas supply.
There was no evidence of smoking as a cause and Mr Rowlands concluded that it was likely that the fire started in the downstairs bedroom but ""couldn't say with 100% certainty what started the fire"".
Assistant coroner Gareth Lewis told the inquest that the carbon monoxide levels in Mrs Edwards' blood were 90.1 - anything over 50 is normally fatal.
He concluded that both Mr and Mrs Edwards died as the result of an accident in their home.
Mr Lewis added that there was some evidence of a ""lack of servicing and maintenance"" of the mechanical bed and mattress provided to Mrs Edwards by Pembrokeshire Community Equipment Service, and that there would be improved monitoring of the equipment in future.

J3WZPOOW4Y_6W3HYH9U8DZPVSQ,South Holderness area considered for radioactive waste disposal,By David McKenna,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-68082963,"Part of East Yorkshire is being considered for the disposal of nuclear waste from across the UK, according to a government agency.
Nuclear Waste Services (NWS) has identified South Holderness as having potential for a Geological Disposal Facility (GDF).
A working group has been formed to examine the proposals.
However NWS's chief executive Corhyn Parr said the scheme would require the support of the local community.
""This is a consent-based process [and] if the community does not express support for a GDF it won't be built there,"" she said.
Two similar working groups have already been established in Cumbria and one at Theddlethorpe on the Lincolnshire coast.
Dr David Richards, independent chairman of the South Holderness working group, said the aim was to work with communities to discuss the potential of a GDF - a series of vaults and tunnels deep underground, or under the sea, where the material would be buried.
""My role as [chairman] is to make sure local communities have access to information and to understand what people think,"" he added.
The leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, Anne Handley, said the authority had accepted an invitation to join the working group.
She said it was the ""first step to opening discussions with the community about whether a GDF would be right for the area"".
""Understanding what a GDF is and exploring the associated benefits is critical to the decision-making process for any community. It will ultimately be [them] that decides,"" she added.
Nuclear power has been part of the UK's energy mix for 70 years and currently provides about 15% of the UK's electricity.
At present, harmful radioactive waste from nuclear power stations is stored in facilities on the surface.
But like any building, these storage structures need maintenance and only have a useful life of about a century. That sort of timescale is but the blink of an eye in the life of radioactive material, some of which can remain harmful for tens of thousands of years.
The need for safe, long-term storage of this dangerous material will continue to rise up the agenda. Convincing residents in GDF communities that these projects are genuinely safe is perhaps the biggest challenge.
Steve Reece, who is head of siting at NWS, said the scheme had the potential to create thousands of jobs and opportunities for investment in local infrastructure.
He said a number of drop-in events were due to take place in the coming weeks and urged people to attend.
Critics have previously raised concerns about the impact of such a scheme on the environment and tourism, with some residents in Lincolnshire holding protests.
In Patrington, the plans have met with a mixed response.
Paul Duplock, who runs an electrical and plumbing business, told BBC Look North: ""Anything that brings prosperity to the area has to be considered because there's not a lot else.
""A few of the other industries in the area are struggling, so if all the risks are minimised then I think [a GDF] certainly has to be considered.""
However, others were concerned about the impact of the scheme, with one woman saying it might ""spoil a beautiful area"".
All sessions run from 11:30 GMT to 18:00.

J448POVAXQ_FYK52S7N0WLOIVC,Namibia's President Hage Geingob going to US for cancer treatment,_,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-68081732,"Namibia's President Hage Geingob, 82, is flying to the US to receive ""specialised"" medical treatment for cancer, his office has said.
It comes less than a week after his office said that medical tests revealed that he had ""cancerous cells"".
The 82-year-old would receive ""novel therapy"" in the US for a week, before returning to continue with his treatment in Namibia, his office added.
Vice-President Nangolo Mumba will be acting president during his absence.
Concerns about Mr Geingob's health have been growing, with reports saying that he admitted last year that he had become frail.
""You see how I'm standing here? It means I'm tired and I'm not feeling well,"" the privately owned Namibian newspaper quoted him as telling journalists.
Mr Geingob is due to step down at the end of his two terms later this year.
In a statement on Tuesday, the vice-president of the governing Swapo party, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, said Mr Geingob was in ""good spirits"" and receiving ""good medical attention"".
She appealed to Namibians to allow Mr Geingob and his family to focus on his recovery and healing process without speculation.
The president's office said he would return from the US on 2 February, and 95% of the treatment for the cancerous cells would be carried out in Namibia.
Last week, it said that doctors had done a colonoscopy and a gastroscopy on the president. This was followed by a biopsy, which revealed cancerous cells.
His office did not give further details of Mr Geingob's condition, but said at the time that he would continue with his presidential duties.
Mr Geingob underwent an aortic operation last year, while in 2014 he revealed that he had survived prostate cancer.
Namibia is due to hold presidential and parliamentary elections in November.
Swapo, which has been in power since independence in 1990, has chosen Mrs Nandi-Ndaitwah as its presidential candidate.
She is currently also Namibia's deputy prime minister, and will become the country's first female president if she wins.

Six people were arrested on Wednesday, including the alleged ringleader from Albania. A stash of jewellery, watches, cash and weapons was found.
The gang is alleged to have carried out 71 thefts from luxury homes and businesses mostly in Marbella.
Police say the suspects were ""highly skilled"" in robberies and break-ins.
""With their knowledge of military techniques, they used strict personal security and counter-surveillance measures while moving around on foot or in vehicles, changing direction or making unexpected stops,"" a police statement alleges.
""They were also trained to access any type of property, regardless of the height of its walls and perimeters, and to act quickly and efficiently,"" it adds.
The alleged ringleader is believed to have taken part in all the robberies, always carrying a firearm. Police described him as an expert in ""boarding [vessels] and counter-surveillance"".
Houses in the city of MÃ¡laga, as well as the towns of Estepona and Torremolinos were also targeted by the gang.
In at least four of the robberies police say physical violence was used.
Police say they were able to apprehend the suspects with the help of a local businessman.

JD5X89G7KO_A8KXKA8YEEFH8F7,Taylor Swift deepfakes spark calls in Congress for new legislation,By Imran Rahman-Jones,1 day ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68110476,"US politicians have called for new laws to criminalise the creation of deepfake images, after explicit faked photos of Taylor Swift were viewed millions of times online.
The images were posted on social media sites, including X and Telegram.
US Representative Joe Morelle called the spread of the pictures ""appalling"".
In a statement, X said it was ""actively removing"" the images and taking ""appropriate actions"" against the accounts involved in spreading them.
It added: ""We're closely monitoring the situation to ensure that any further violations are immediately addressed, and the content is removed.""
While many of the images appear to have been removed at the time of publication, one photo of Swift was viewed a reported 47 million times before being taken down.
The name ""Taylor Swift"" is no longer searchable on X, alongside terms such as ""Taylor Swift AI"" and ""Taylor AI"".
Deepfakes use artificial intelligence (AI) to make a video of someone by manipulating their face or body. A study in 2023 found that there has been a 550% rise in the creation of doctored images since 2019, fuelled by the emergence of AI.
There are currently no federal laws against the sharing or creation of deepfake images, though there have been moves at state level to tackle the issue.
In the UK, the sharing of deepfake pornography became illegal as part of its Online Safety Act in 2023.
Democratic Rep Morelle, who last year unveiled the proposed Preventing Deepfakes of Intimate Images Act - which would have made it illegal to share deepfake pornography without consent - called for urgent action on the issue.
He said the images and videos ""can cause irrevocable emotional, financial, and reputational harm - and unfortunately, women are disproportionately impacted"".
Pornography consists of the overwhelmingly majority of the deepfakes posted online, with women making up 99% of those targeted in such content, according to the State of Deepfakes report published last year.
""What's happened to Taylor Swift is nothing new,"" Democratic Rep Yvette D Clarke posted on X. She noted that women had been targeted by the technology ""for years"", adding that with ""advancements in AI, creating deepfakes is easier & cheaper"".
Republican Congressman Tom Kean Jr agreed, saying that it is ""clear that AI technology is advancing faster than the necessary guardrails"".
""Whether the victim is Taylor Swift or any young person across our country, we need to establish safeguards to combat this alarming trend,"" he added.
Swift has not spoken publicly about the images, but the Daily Mail reported that her team is ""considering legal action"" against the site which published the AI-generated images.
Worries about AI-generated content have increased as billions of people vote in elections this year across the globe.
This week, a fake robocall claiming to be from US President Joe Biden sparked an investigation. It is thought to have been made by AI.

JME55L0X1Z_YLB6DQGOOFN74GU,Doomsday Clock stays at 90 seconds to midnight,By Jane Corbin,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68017445,"The Doomsday Clock - which shows how symbolically close the world is to nuclear Armageddon - is to remain at 90 seconds to midnight.
Scientists have listed reasons for keeping its hands the closest they have ever been to ""Doomsday"" - but stopped short of nudging it further forward.
The threat of a new nuclear arms race, the Ukraine war and climate change concerns were all factors, they said.
The clock is set annually by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.
Since 2007, members have considered the impact of new man-made risks such as AI and climate change, as well as the greatest threat - nuclear war.
In its 2024 announcement on Tuesday, the Bulletin said that China, Russia and the US were all spending huge sums to ""expand or modernise their nuclear arsenals"" - which added to the ""ever-present danger of nuclear war through mistake or miscalculation"".
The war in Ukraine had also created an ""ever-present risk of nuclear escalation"", it said.
A lack of action on climate change and risks linked to ""misusing"" emerging biological technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools were also cited.
The Doomsday Clock was created in 1947 by J Robert Oppenheimer and fellow US scientists who had developed the atomic bomb.
They had seen its devastating effects two years earlier, at the end of World War Two, on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They wanted to warn the public and put pressure on world leaders to make sure nuclear weapons were never used again.
The hands of the clock have moved 25 times. In 1947, they started at seven minutes to midnight. At the end of the Cold War, in 1991, they had fallen back to 17 minutes to midnight.
Bulletin president Rachel Bronson told the BBC that ""every major country, including the UK, is investing in their nuclear arsenal as if nuclear weapons are usable for a very long time. This is a very dangerous timeâ¦ leaders are not acting responsibly.""
Nuclear Armageddon: How Close Are We?
With the Doomsday Clock the closest it's ever been to midnight, Jane Corbin investigates the proliferation of nuclear weapons across the globe and the breakdown of systems of constraint.
Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)
Pavel Podvig, a Russian nuclear weapons expert who has been involved in setting the Doomsday Clock for many years, says he was shocked when President Putin put Russia's nuclear forces on alert after the invasion of Ukraine.
The world reacted with horror to the Russian leader's threat but it seems he had made a deliberate calculation.
""This is exactly what nuclear weapons are there for - to make certain you have a certain freedom of action,"" Podvig says. ""The Russian President believed that by making these statements he could deter the West from intervening in Ukraine which was a correct calculation - this is how deterrence works.""
Despite decades of arms control agreements there are still about 13,000 nuclear warheads globally, 90% of them Russian and American. Six other countries are declared nuclear powers: the UK, France, China, India, Pakistan and North Korea. Israel is widely believed to have these weapons, but has never confirmed it. Most modern nuclear weapons are many times more powerful than those that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
In 2021, the UK increased the cap on its warheads from 225 to 260, potentially 35 more warheads, and the country's nuclear force is on high alert. Since the war in Ukraine began, there has been rhetoric from senior Russian figures suggesting Moscow's nuclear weapons could be used against the UK.
The UK's nuclear deterrent is housed in the west of Scotland at the Faslane base, home to four Vanguard submarines that carry Trident missiles armed with nuclear warheads.
Feargal Dalton, a former Lt Cdr who served on board submarine HMS Victorious, is one of a handful of people who have actually fired a Trident missile: a test missile with a dummy warhead.
""There's always one [submarine] somewhere out there, at 15 minutes notice to fire,"" Dalton says. ""As we speak there is a nuclear deterrent out there. The Vladimir Putins of the world know it's out there, it's credible and we could use it if needs be.""
Ever since the atomic bomb was created there has been opposition to these weapons. In the 1980s, the women of the Greenham Common peace camp fought to get all US nuclear missiles removed from UK soil - the last warheads left in 2008.
However, at RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) is now protesting against the possibility of US weapons returning.
Pentagon documents - first reported by the Federation of American Scientists - suggest US ""special"" weapons will be stationed at the base. US fighter planes that are capable of dropping such weapons arrived at Lakenheath in 2021 and there are now plans by the United States Air Force to build dormitories for troops to serve in a potential nuclear mission on this site.
""We know that we have got public opinion on our side,"" Sophie Bolt from CND explains - as her small group chant slogans over the perimeter fence of the base. ""Nearly 60% of the population do not want to have nuclear bombs sited in Britain.""
""We've got nothing to do with this base, it is totally under US control,"" Alan Wright, another protestor says. ""If we get Trump in [the White House] next time and he may press the button because he's got a bigger button than Putin - then we are a target.""
However, Donald Trump has previously said he would end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours of being elected, although he hasn't explained how. Some analysts believe it is likely that  US support for Ukraine could be diminished.
In the past decade, fears of a nuclear war have also been ramped up by Kim Jong-Un, leader of North Korea, the latest nation to join the nuclear club. He has boasted of testing nuclear-capable missiles that could reach the United States.
Former Bulletin of Atomic Scientists member and Doomsday Clock adviser, Sig Hecker, has visited North Korea's nuclear facilities seven times as part of a scientific research programme and estimates it could have 50 to 60 nuclear warheads by now.
""Nuclear weapons, nuclear terrorism, nuclear proliferation - it's all going in the wrong direction,"" he says.

A jacket potato seller said he had sold almost 1,500 potatoes in a single day after global success on TikTok.
Social media posts from Ben Newman - aka Spudman - are so a-peeling, he has become an international mash hit, but he admits to being in the dark as to why.
In the meantime, he keeps posting and visitors keep arriving to his trailer in Tamworth town centre, Staffordshire. If you bake it, they will come.
Among those to taste his taters, he said, were customers from across the globe.
Mr Newman joined TikTok to promote his business in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. He has since been praised for using his prominent pomme de terre profile to promote the town and other local businesses.
He said of post-pandemic trading: âWe got back into the town centre and we needed to let people know where we were.
âThis new thing, TikTok, had come around and we started posting a few videos on there.â
He said he simply posted updates on what he did, livestreaming his work, with thousands of people eventually tuning in from around the world to watch.

He said: âWe did a video with a couple who flew over from Malaysia, landed in Gatwick, hired a car and came straight over for a jacket potato.â
Mr Newman has set up a partnership with a wholesaler, and will be handing out free potatoes at his pitch on Saturday.
He said the gesture was funded through his social media activity, and he was pleased to have the chance to âgive something backâ after all the support he had been shown.

Lord Hay of Ballyore had previously been denied a passport because he was born in Donegal, although he lived in Northern Ireland for most of his life.
He was told that he would have to undergo a naturalisation process before being entitled to a British passport.
He currently holds an Irish passport but on Friday, ministers agreed to change the system.
The government backed a private members' bill brought by DUP MP Gavin Robinson.
It would allow people born in the Republic of Ireland after 1948 who move to Northern Ireland legally and live there for more than five years to register as British citizens.
Welcoming the news, Lord Hay said it had been a long battle but at last the government had accepted the ""flaws in the system"".
""This was first raised in the House of Commons by my colleague Gregory Campbell but the Home Office refused to make any changes despite the clear injustice,"" he said.
""I am glad common sense has finally prevailed but it should not have taken this long.""
After the Republic of Ireland left the Commonwealth in 1949, people born in the Republic were no longer entitled to British citizenship or passport.
In putting forward his bill, Gavin Robinson told MPs he was seeking to right a wrong.
He said under the Belfast Agreement those born in Northern Ireland were entitled to hold an Irish passport but those born in the Republic and who consider themselves British were denied a UK passport.
He added that he has been seeking to introduce the bill for the past nine years but without success.
In response, Home Office Minister Tom Pursglove said the government would be supporting the bill subject to some small amendments which had already been agreed with the DUP MP.
He added it was right to ""find a way to correct this issue in the system"".
""It will make a credible difference to those Irish nationals who want to be British citizens,"" he said.
It is not clear when the bill will become law.

A granddaughter of a Scots-born prime minister says she has only got to know about her grandfather by moving into a house he lived in almost 90 years ago.
James Ramsay MacDonald formed Britain's first Labour government 100 years ago on 22 January 1924.
Today, his granddaughter Iona Kielhorn lives in The Hillocks, the house he had built in his home town of Lossiemouth in 1909.
Mrs Kielhorn, with help from relatives, has kept the house almost like it was when her grandfather was alive.
MacDonald died in 1937 when Mrs Kielhorn was a young girl.
Mrs Kielhorn moved to Lossiemouth 17 years ago after a childhood in England and spending most of her adult life in Germany.
Speaking to BBC Naidheachdan, she said: ""I knew nothing about Ramsay MacDonald.
""I knew that I had a prime minister grandfather, but nobody at home ever talked about him.
""Its been very educational coming to Lossiemouth.""
Ramsay MacDonald, right, with his family and the house in Lossiemouth in 1931
Mrs Kielhorn believes society attitudes in the past had overshadowed his achievements, which included opposing wars and appointing the first female minister. He served as PM for a second time between 1929 to 1935.
MacDonald's upbringing had been a source of controversy, and used against him during his political career.
He was the son of working class and unmarried parents. His mother was a house maid and his father a farm labourer.
A teacher at MacDonald's school in Lossiemouth, a fishing port, recognised his academic talent and encouraged him to further his education.
Mrs Kielhorn said MacDonald was warned the alternative was dangerous work as a fisherman and likely die at sea by his 30s.
The Hillocks retains furniture and features from MacDonald's time
MacDonald had ambitions to become a science teacher and moved to London.
In the city he became actively involved in Socialist politics.
He drew criticism for his opposition to Britain's involvement in World War I.
Later, in 1924 during a period of political upheaval, he was asked to form a minority Labour government.
It lasted until October that year when a general election ended in defeat for Labour.
Mrs Kielhorn said Lossiemouth provided her grandfather with an escape from political tension.
But she added there were still times that were difficult for him in his home town.

Listen to news from north east Scotland on BBC Sounds
MacDonald and his wife, feminist and social reformer Margaret Ethel Gladstone, wanted to build The Hillocks on a hilltop site in Lossiemouth.
The plot was near a quarry where MacDonald had collected fossils in his youth.
But Mrs Kielhorn said some people already living in the area were unimpressed by his political views and upbringing.
She said her grandfather was told to build his house in ""the slums"" among the town's fisherfolk.
The Hillocks was constructed in Moray Street, near Lossiemouth's Seatown fishing community.
The house was originally built for MacDonald's mother Anne so she could look after his five children while he and Gladstone were on political tours, including of Australia.
The cost of building the house, about Â£400, was paid for by Gladstone.
Mrs Kielhorn never met her grandmother. Gladstone died in 1911 from blood poisoning.
Following his own death - of heart failure aged 71 and while at sea on an ocean liner - MacDonald was buried alongside his wife at a graveyard in Spynie, near Lossiemouth.
The house has remained in the MacDonald family ever since.

Today, The Hillocks retains many of the features from Mrs Kielhorn's grandparents' time there.
They include the kitchen chairs, also writing tables, books, ornaments, paintings and a bath MacDonald had installed upstairs.
Mrs Kielhorn said she has no interest in politics but by living in Lossiemouth she has learned much about her grandfather's life in the town.
Stories she has been told, include of MacDonald taking a pair of wire cutters with him on walks so he could open gates a local landowner had chained up to prevent public access to land.
She said on some visits he would go on long walks in the Cairngorms with his London police officer bodyguard in tow.
The house was built in MacDonald's home town of Lossiemouth
Mrs Kielhorn said: ""Lossiemouth was his stabilising anchor.
""I think it was an escape.
""He loved his walking, loved bird-watching and loved collecting fossils.""
She added: ""He would go into Seatown and sit with the fisherfolk.
""I don't think they spoke about anything - certainly not politics.
""They would just sit there smoking their pipes.""

Prof Leitch gave then Health Secretary Humza Yousaf mask rule advice for a social event in late 2021
Scotland's national clinical director advised Humza Yousaf to keep a drink in his hands at all times to remain ""exempt"" from mask rules at a dinner, the UK Covid Inquiry has heard.
The UK Covid Inquiry was shown a WhatsApp exchange between Prof Jason Leitch and the then health secretary.
Prof Leitch told the now first minister ""literally no-one"" followed official guidance about wearing a mask when not seated at dinner.
He denied giving him a ""workaround"".
The national clinical adviser said it was ""tricky"" to comply with guidance at such occasions, and admitted breaking the same rule.
He told the inquiry he had believed it was ""legitimate"" to stand without a mask after being approached for a photograph at a dinner.
The first minister's spokesperson said Mr Yousaf had sought ""clarity on what the rules meant"". He denied Mr Yousaf was not on top of the rules as a government minister during the pandemic.
Prof Leitch confirmed he used an auto-delete function on a Covid WhatsApp chat during the pandemic but insisted he followed Scottish government records management policy.
But he said a WhatsApp comment he made, previously shown at the inquiry, about deleting messages as a ""pre-bed ritual"" was a ""flippant exaggeration"".
Messages read out at the inquiry showed then health secretary Mr Yousaf, who served in the role between 2021 and 2023, asked the national clinical director for guidance before attending a dinner where he was due to give a speech.
Mr Yousaf wrote: ""I know sitting at the table, I don't need my mask. If I'm standing talking to folk, need my mask on? [sic].""
Prof Leitch responded: ""Officially yes. But literally no-one does. Have a drink in your hands at ALL times. Then you're exempt. So if someone comes over and you stand, lift your drink.""
The inquiry heard that at the time, in November 2021, the Delta and Omicron variants were driving a surge in infections, leading to a peak in cases eight times higher than during the initial Covid wave in 2020.
Counsel to the inquiry, Jamie Dawson KC, asked: ""If health secretary didn't understand the rules, what chance did anyone else have?""
Prof Leitch told the inquiry there was ""difficulty"" and ""nuance"" with the rules about wearing a mask at hospitality functions and that he got the impression no-one followed the official guidance at the ""few"" such occasions he attended.
He said it was a ""tricky area that I found tricky as well"".
The national clinical director described an incident that was posted on social media when he was approached at a dinner and asked for a photo but was not wearing a mask.
""Strictly speaking that was breaking the rules but it was during a dinner and during a social occasion and therefore I thought it was legitimate,"" he told the inquiry.
Prof Leitch rejected a suggestion from Mr Dawson that he had offered the then health secretary a ""workaround"" to the rules.
""I gave him advice to show him how to comply with the rules,"" the national clinical director said.
He told the inquiry that except for direct Twitter messages, he had not retained any one-to-one informal communications related to managing the pandemic.
Prof Leitch was asked about why he said in a WhatsApp group chat from May 2021: ""WhatsApp deletion is a pre-bed ritual.""
He told the inquiry he did not delete messages every day.
""This was a flippant exaggeration in an informal messaging group and it wasn't done every day before I went to bed,"" the national clinical director told the inquiry.
In another WhatsApp chat, Prof Leitch advised colleagues in September 2020: ""Just my usual reminder to delete your chat ... particularly after we reach a conclusion.""
The national clinical director told the inquiry that he was following Scottish government guidance that once a decision had been reached, and that had been submitted to the records management system, the chat should then be deleted.
Prof Leitch said he also applied an auto-delete function to a group with chief medical officer Gregor Smith and Jim McMenamin, the chairman of the National Incident Management Team.
Asked whose messages he thought that would remove, the national clinical director answered: ""That's good question I think it deletes everybody's.""
He said he was ""comfortable"" doing so despite the risk it could delete messages before a submission had been made to the corporate record because ""the decisions we were coming to were being dealt with very, very quickly"".
Meanwhile, at Holyrood, Scottish Labour health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said Prof Leitch appeared to have advised Mr Yousaf ""how to avoid the rules"" and suggested he should be sacked if the government agreed his behaviour was ""inappropriate"".
She said: ""It is clear that Jason Leitch wiped his messages completely and seem to find the period during the pandemic all quite funny, judging from the messages we have seen.""
Scottish Tory health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane said that ""behind the scenes it is clear the Scottish government was mocking us, believing none of this would ever come to light"".
Deputy First Minister Shona Robison Ms Robison said it was important the inquiry was allowed to scrutinise messages and decision-making.
""It's for the inquiry, obviously, to determine if it has concerns about the application of mobile messaging policy or their content,"" she told MSPs.
The finance secretary added that it was not ""fair"" to focus on any individual and Prof Leitch was not present to defend himself.
Next to give evidence to the inquiry was Devi Sridhar, professor and chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, who gave advice to the Scottish government during the pandemic.
She said she had received abuse and death threats after becoming a well-known figure during the crisis.
She spoke about what she described as her ""close working relationship"" with former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who she said offered to become her first client after qualifying as a personal trainer in a ""throwaway"" comment.
Prof Sridhar said they only met in person twice, both at official meetings.
The inquiry was shown several exchanges between the pair via Twitter direct messages.
In the exchange from June 2020, Prof Sridhar said she was worried about overstepping the mark by sending a draft policy paper to Ms Sturgeon.
The then first minister replied: ""Don't worry about protocol"", adding that ""tackling the virus more important than that"".
Ms Sturgeon also said she would ""handle any issues on that front"".
She then gave the professor her personal SNP email address and mobile number.
Prof Sridhar told the inquiry: ""I think people emphasised a lot that they felt I was under pressure or I was too friendly with her and I thought that came out because we got on quite well.""
But the public health expert said she had ""similar relationships"" with many politicians, including chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, Labour MP Jonathan Ashworth and Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran.

K3HFAMY7PF_FSMTAEIPDTTH990,Kneecap movie: Irish language film wins Sundance audience award,_,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-68113807,"Irish-language film Kneecap featuring a Belfast rap group has been awarded a prize at the Sundance Film Festival.
The film depicts a semi-fictionalised account of how the west Belfast rap trio, Kneecap, was formed.
It has snapped up an Audience Award: NEXT, beating five films including one starring Friends' David Schwimmer.
Academy Award nominee Michael Fassbender stars in the Kneecap film alongside group members MÃ³glaÃ­ Bap, Mo Chara and DJ PrÃ³vaÃ­.
The premiere last week at the festival in Utah marked the first time an Irish-language film had screened at Sundance.
Kneecap is also the first non-US film to ever be selected for the NEXT section of the festival.
Director Rich Peppiatt accepted the award on behalf of the band who returned to Belfast recently after a week of film promotion in the United States.
He told RTÃ News: ""Ever since we arrived at Sundance, the sun has kept shining on this film.""
Producer Trevor Birney said winning was ""surreal"".
""We had ambition for the film from the outset, but never allowed ourselves to dream that it would screen at the world's greatest film festival,"" he said.
""To win a film at Sundance is simply surreal.
""Irish films and our talent are having a moment and Belfast is playing its part.""
The film has recently been acquired by Sony Pictures Classics and is now set for release in North America and other major, global markets. It is expected to be screened in the UK and Ireland later this year.

K7C2FS0MYK_FFHFIQN419HR9HY,Alaska Airlines warns of $150m Boeing blow-out cost,By Natalie Sherman,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68096634,"Alaska Airlines says it is facing a $150m (Â£118m) hit, after the dramatic mid-air blow-out of a panel on one of its planes this month.
The 5 Jan incident on a Boeing 737 Max 9 plane terrified passengers and prompted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ground 171 jets with similar designs.
Alaska had to cancel more than 3,000 flights in the wake of the incident.
It said it expected its travel to return to normal by early next month.
But it warned that growth would be lower than expected in the months ahead, as deliveries of new Boeing aircraft are likely delayed.
The FAA on Wednesday said the grounded Boeing planes could return to service if they have been inspected.
But Boeing's output has been capped, while the FAA investigates its manufacturing.
The troubles at the company, one of the world's two major plane-makers, are now spilling over to the rest of the industry.
United Airlines, another major 737 Max 9 customer, earlier this week said it was braced for delays in deliveries and looking at alternatives to Boeing as it plotted out aircraft orders.
It warned investors that it would lose money in the first quarter due to the incident.
Executives at Southwest and American, which are also reporting earnings this week, have also echoed the concerns about delayed aircraft and frustration with Boeing.
""Boeing needs to get their act together,"" American Airlines chief executive Robert Isom said.
Boeing for its part, has apologised for the disruption and pledged to work transparently and cooperatively with regulators.
Alaska Airlines had also faced questions from passengers, after it was revealed that the airline had restricted the jet involved in the accident from certain routes due to a pressure issue.
Chief executive Ben Minicucci said the problem was ""totally unrelated"". Speaking to financial analysts, he said passengers should feel confident in the safety of flying on its planes.
Mr Minicucci said he was having ""tough"" conversations with Boeing and would hold its ""feet to the fire"", but did not go so far as to threaten to cancel orders.
""We have a longstanding deep relationship,"" he said, noting that the company had been happy with the planes in the past.
Boeing has been struggling with a spate of smaller manufacturing issues in recent years, while trying to repair its reputation after fatal accidents in 2018 and 2019 - involving a different version of the 737 Max - killed 346 people.
Robert Mann, president of RW Mann & Company, an airline analysis and consulting firm in New York, said airlines used to have staff on hand to oversee more of the manufacturing process, but that they had scrapped that practice in recent decades in a drive to cut costs.
""As upset as these airlines are - and you can understand why they would be - they don't exactly have clean hands,"" he said.
Now, with the industry dominated by just two big players - Boeing and European rival Airbus - they are in ""a bit of a box"", he added.
They don't ""really have any alternative as a practical matter,"" he said.

Footage from schools in urgent need of repair across Britain has been gathered by BBC Panorama.

In a statement, a Department for Education spokesperson said the government had allocated Â£15bn of capital funding since 2015 for essential maintenance and improvements, including Â£470m in 2023 ""to address school buildings in need of immediate support as quickly as possible"".
The government has also said it is committed to rebuilding 500 schools in England over the next 10 years.
In Wales, the government says it spent Â£2.3bn over the past 10 years rebuilding and refurbishing schools.
Meanwhile, the Scottish government says it provided Â£1bn of funding to the Learning Estate Investment Programme (LEIP), which started in 2019."
KCC6OMX9BO_GE88OHJ2BWUBVEN,Moston man who made ecstasy pills in bedroom lab jailed,By Ewan Gawne,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-68072599,"A man who made more than 38,500 ecstasy tablets in a makeshift laboratory set up in a bedroom has been jailed.
Greater Manchester Police said officers found the pills at Jian Huang's home in Moston in April 2023.
The force said the drugs were ""likely bound for Parklife festival due to when they were recovered"".
The 46-year-old admitted possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply at Manchester Crown Court and was sentenced to nine years in prison.
A police representative said officers were called to an anonymous reports of a row inside Huang's home on Arran Street on 19 April 2023.
They said Huang acted ""extremely evasive"" when officers questioned him and a subsequent search of the property revealed an upstairs bedroom with a padlocked door.
After forcing entry into the room, officers found the tablets and equipment that could be used to convert ecstasy into pills from its liquid form.
The force said some of the tablets were found suspended in liquid, while others were discovered drying around the makeshift laboratory.
Speaking after sentencing, Det Con Heather Gore said the case was ""a great example of how much we rely on the public to report crime to us"".
""Response officers did an outstanding job in bringing Huang to justice,"" she said.
""It looked like Huang was preparing to sell these drugs, which would have likely ended up at festivals such as Parklife, so seizing such a huge quantity was a significant result.""

KGTOC1WSPL_OJ8AYFON270XB5X,Holocaust denier to be extradited after losing legal battle,_,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-68109156,"A French Holocaust denier who spent two years on the run in Scotland has lost his legal battle against extradition.
Vincent Reynouard was apprehended in Anstruther in November 2022.
The 54-year-old is wanted by the authorities in France where he is accused of inciting hatred and denying the occurrence of the Holocaust.
A warrant for Reynouard arrest in 2022 set out three offences arising from seven videos he posted online between September 2019 and April 2020.
At Edinburgh Sheriff Court last year, the private tutor fought and lost a challenge to sending him back to face prosecution.
His application for leave to appeal has now also been rejected.
Scotland's senior judge the Lord Justice General, Lord Carloway, heard the case with Lord Pentland and Lord Tyre at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh.
Lord Carloway said: ""The denial of the Holocaust is a gross insult to the members of the Jewish and other communities whose members perished in Auschwitz and Birkenau.""
He said it was not necessary to be a member of the relevant communities to be ""grossly offended by such statements"".
He described other statements Reynouard about the Jewish community as ""antisemitic racism"".
The judge said although it was not an offence to hold such views or to express them in certain contexts, it was a breach of Communications Act legislation to communicate them to the public on the internet.
""This is the modern world in which posting videos on YouTube or social media can have a significant practical and enduring consequence relative to the behaviour of others,"" he said.
""It is not too difficult, especially in the present climate of tension in several parts of the world, to envisage that a repeated publication of antisemitic, or other racist material could provoke serious disturbance by certain sections of society.""
Lord Carloway also said the seven videos featuring Reynouard amounted to an offence of relative seriousness by Scottish standards.
A French judge had issued a warrant for Reynouard arrest in 2022 after he posted the videos online.
It was said he had trivialised a war crime, challenged the occurrence of crimes against humanity and incited the public to hatred or violence because of origin, nation, race or religion.
In one video Reynouard denied that the 1944 massacre by the Waffen SS at the French village of Oradour took place - where women and children were burnt alive.
He also denied the existence of gas chambers at the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz and claimed the Holocaust was made up of multiple lies, errors or half truths.
He suggested that the corpses found there were not victims of genocide but were hundreds of ""cripples"" who had not survived transport to the camps.
In one video he stated: ""There is a Jewish problem. A problem that Hitler saw clearly.""
He went to describe the Nazi leader as ""the most slandered man"" and said he wanted to ""rehabilitate"" National Socialism.
For Reynouard it was argued that the videos did not threaten serious disturbance to the community and did not constitute a call to action and that to extradite him would be disproportionate."
KJEEVYWJOQ_N1B67T7NYMZ1ZJO,Cryptocurrency firm Terraform Labs files for bankruptcy in US,_,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68055557,"The cryptocurrency company behind the crashed TerraUSD and Luna tokens has filed for bankruptcy in the US.
Terraform Labs' tokens collapsed in May, losing $40bn of their value and contributing to the so-called ""cryptocrash"" of 2022.
Co-founder Do Kwon is currently in jail in Montenegro after having been found guilty of forging documents.
He has been charged with defrauding investors by US regulators and is awaiting extradition.
He also faces fraud charges in South Korea, his native country, so could be extradited there.
A third legal case is ongoing in Singapore, where the company is registered.
Terraform Labs' Luna token came to prominence in December 2021, when its value began to rise from $5 to a high of $116 in April 2022.
Fans of Luna became known as ""Lunatics"", with Mr Kwon referred to as their ""king"".
Then suddenly, on 9 May 2022, it collapsed, losing 99% of its value in just 48 hours.
It was algorithmically linked to its sister coin, TerraUSD, which was a stablecoin, meaning it was meant to stay at at a value of $1.
But the value of TerraUSD plummeted to about $0.02 - which then caused the Luna coin to nosedive.
The crash led to shockwaves around the crypto market, with investors pulling billions of dollars from other cryptocurrencies in fear of a similar crash.
It is estimated that about $400bn was wiped from the value of other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.
Announcing the bankruptcy filing, Terraform Labs chief executive Chris Amani said: ""This action is necessary to allow us to continue working toward our collective goals while resolving the legal challenges that remain outstanding.""
TerraformÂ ""intendsÂ toÂ meetÂ allÂ financialÂ obligationsÂ toÂ employeesÂ andÂ vendorsÂ duringÂ theÂ ChapterÂ 11Â caseÂ andÂ doesÂ notÂ require additionalÂ financingÂ toÂ doÂ so,"" the company said in a statement.
A Chapter 11 bankruptcy means that Terraform Labs can continue to do business.
The firm offers blockchain and other Web3-related services.
The bankruptcy documents, filed in Baltimore, list Terraform as having between $100m and $500m in assets.
They also say Do Kwon owns 92% of the shares of the company, with his co-founder Daniel Hyunsung Shin owning the other 8%.
Mr Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 as he tried to board a plane to Dubai.
Three months later, he was found guilty of forging documents - which he denied - and sentenced to jail.
The former finance officer of Terraform Labs, Han Chang-joon, was also sentenced to prison after being found guilty of the same charges.
According to Reuters, police had found doctored Costa Rican passports and a separate set of Belgian passports among their luggage.
In November 2023 a court in Montenegro approved his extradition, but was yet to decide whether it would be to South Korea or the US.

KJKQDS8CL0_BC9TOTEKZCBVOJ5,Baby Elsa: Details of woman released after newborn found in bag,_,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-68109732,"Police have released details of a woman they want to trace after the discovery of a baby in a shopping bag in Newham.
Baby Elsa, who was found by a dog walker in sub-zero temperatures, has since been discharged from hospital and is in foster care.
The Metropolitan Police said a woman was seen entering Greenway at around 20:45 GMT on 18 January.
Elsa was found 30 minutes later at the junction of Greenway and High Street South.
Ch Supt Simon Crick said the whole country had been concerned for Elsa and her mother's welfare.
He said the woman officers wanted to trace was black and was wearing a large dark coat with a light-coloured scarf or hood around her neck and had a rucksack on her back.
""Since our first appeal we've had 17 reports from the public sharing information and I can assure people that every single one is assessed and progressed where that information is thought helpful,"" he said.
""Baby Elsa is safe and well. I'm sure people will have seen recent reporting that she has now left hospital. Our colleagues in Newham Council continue to make sure she's well looked after and cared for.
""My team are continuing their work. We've collected a considerable volume of CCTV footage. While we're still examining it in detail, we have identified a woman we would like to speak to, and a witness who may have seen her.""
He added that officers believed the woman entered Greenway from High Street South and left heading in the direction Fabian Street.
The Met also wants to trace a witness officer think saw the woman in the vicinity.
Ch Supt Crick said: ""He is believed to be male, wearing a dark-coloured hooded coat, with a backpack; the coat or backpack has a reflective strip on the rear of it. He exited the Greenway at around 21:10.""
Elsa was born approximately an hour before she was abandoned and still had her umbilical cord.
Doctors believe she was a full-term baby and weighed 6lbs 6oz (2.9kg) when she was found.
Since then, officers have carried out door-to-door inquiries, speaking to residents and businesses.
""We've also spoken to local hospitals, social workers and local charities. All of the information we have so far suggests it's highly likely Baby Elsa was born after a concealed pregnancy and was not a service user of these agencies,"" Ch Supt Crick added.
""I want to appeal directly again to Baby Elsa's mother. Your daughter is safe and well, but we need make sure that you are too. You might need urgent medical care and support, and we can help you. Please call 999 and speak to us, or go to hospital.
""Lastly, I'd like to say that although comments online have been largely incredibly kind, supportive and understanding, there have been a small number of abusive and negative comments that are both unnecessary and unhelpful. All of us are looking at this from a position of privilege in that we have no idea what Baby Elsa's mother is going through.
""Please consider what you post - and the possibility that she might even read it - and help us with our primary aim of identifying her to make sure that she's OK.""

KJZWGDKWSZ_PD3MDCQ250MAU4W,Blackpool mum removed six-year-old child's teeth with pliers - MP,By Emma Stanley,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-68104788,"A mother used pliers to remove her six-year-old daughter's teeth as she could not get an appointment with an NHS dentist, an MP has said.
Blackpool South MP Scott Benton told the Commons it was ""sadly impossible"" for new patients to find a health service dentist.
He said his constituents were attending surgeries ""pleading with me to get them the treatment they so badly need"".
The Department for Health said it had taken steps to improve access.
The independent MP told Parliament: ""It is estimated that 40% of my constituents - some 35,000 people - cannot currently access NHS treatment.
""Only last week, a mother attended my surgery who had to physically remove the teeth of her six-year-old daughter with pliers because she was in so much pain and could not access the treatment her family needed.
""As the NHS dentistry recovery plan is long overdue, would it be in order for the House to receive a ministerial statement on when we may finally see some progress on this issue?""
The leader of the Commons, Penny Mordaunt, replied that she was ""sorry to hear about the situation"" and ""the government have given a considerable uplift to local commissioners to ensure that providers are in place"".
Mr Benton told the BBC the child ""had several rotten teeth"" and ""was in pain and they didn't have a local dentist"".
The mother ""wasn't aware of the emergency dental care provided locally at Whitegate Drive and took several of her child's teeth out as a result.,"" he said, adding it was ""an absolutely harrowing and heartbreaking case"".
""Our lack of local NHS dentists is unsustainable and unacceptable and the government needs to publish its dental recovery plan urgently and match this with funding to start to repair the situation,"" he said.
The Department of Health and Social Care said it would be publishing a dental recovery plan shortly and had already taken steps to improve access, including increasing dental training places by 40%.
In 2022, a BBC investigation found nine in 10 NHS dental practices across the UK were not accepting new adult patients for treatment under the health service.
That investigation was unable to find any practices in Blackpool taking on new NHS patients, with one woman in the resort saying she had resorted to making her own dentures.
In December, the Nuffield Trust think tank said the NHS dental service in England had been cut back so much it was now in the most perilous position in its 75-year history.

KOVG8EVT63_EFRW27AAQUOEA4N,Driving test examiners announce four-day strike,By Jeremy Culley,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68107990,"Almost 2,000 driving test examiners will strike for four consecutive days next month in a row over workloads.
The walkouts across 270 test centres in England, Scotland and Wales will take place from 8 to 11 February.
Examiners will strike in protest at ""flawed"" plans demanding they deliver 150,000 more tests by the end of March to help clear a backlog.
The DVSA (Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency) branded the strike decision ""disappointing"".
All eligible managers and administrative staff in the DVSA have been asked to return to carrying out driving tests full time in a bid to hit the target.
But examiners fear delivering the extra tests could pose ""significant"" safety risks for them and their customers, and will erode their terms and conditions.
Waiting times for a driving test soared to an average peak of 24 weeks in November 2022, partly down to Covid lockdowns over the previous two years.
Before the pandemic, the average wait time from booking the test online was about six weeks.
The Public and Commercial Services union general secretary Mark Serwotka said examiners want to maintain high standards but are ""unable to do that if they're expected to work longer and longer hours"".
""If Mark Harper (Transport Secretary) was serious about reducing the backlog, he would invest in DVSA, employing more examiners, not just expecting the existing ones to work harder,"" he added.
DVSA chief executive Loveday Ryder said the strike action would cause an impact to its services, but said candidates should attend their test as usual unless they were contacted directly.
She added: ""Learners expect a seven-day per week service, and, as a publicly funded body, DVSA wants to provide that.""
Driving instructor Naughton Dunn, from Ludlow, Shropshire, told the BBC in December that candidates as far away as Essex and Edinburgh had contacted him for lessons.
They had booked tests in the town after searching nationwide and wanted to familiarise themselves with the likely route, he said.
Last year, the DVSA announced other measures to help tackle the backlog.
They included changing rules to stop drivers booking tests before they are ready and lengthening the wait for a retest for those who fail.
In December, the average wait time fell to 17.4 weeks with more than 150,000 tests - a record for the month - carried out, according to the DVSA.
It has previously pledged to take ""all measures we can to reduce driving test waiting times"" including the recruitment of almost 500 new driving examiners.

KSGLPBUOZO_YO37HN06HJABQEF,J&J strikes US states deal over baby powder claims,_,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68072951,"Johnson & Johnson (J&J) has said it has reached a tentative deal with more than 40 US states over their investigation of the marketing of its talc-based baby powder and other products.
The healthcare giant said it expected to pay $700m (Â£552m), confirming a figure that had been reported earlier.
The deal would be part of a far bigger settlement the firm has been trying to reach to resolve claims around the safety of the products.
J&J says they were safe for consumers.
But it is facing more than 50,000 cases from people who claim using its talc-based baby powder caused cancer, including some who allege the product contained cancer-causing asbestos.
The company created a subsidiary responsible for the claims in an effort to resolve the lawsuits in bankruptcy court.
Last year, it proposed a nearly $9bn settlement, saying the claims were ""specious"" but it wanted to move on from the issue.
But judges have blocked those plans, ruling that the subsidiary was not in financial distress and could not use the bankruptcy system to resolve the lawsuits.
State officials did not comment on the tentative deal.
Erik Haas, worldwide vice president of litigation for Johnson & Johnson, said the company was continuing to work on a wider resolution.
""The company continues to pursue several paths to achieve a comprehensive and final resolution of the talc litigation. As was leaked last week, that progress includes an agreement in principle that the company reached with a consortium of 43 state attorneys general to resolve their talc claims,"" he said in a statement.
""We will continue to address the claims of those who do not want to participate in our contemplated consensual bankruptcy resolution through litigation or settlement.""
Johnson & Johnson has won a majority of the talc lawsuits against it and has maintained the products did not contain asbestos and did not cause cancer.
But it has been stuck with some significant losses, including one decision in which 22 women were awarded a judgement of more than $2bn.
Analysts estimate the company will end up spending more than $10bn to resolve the legal battles.
A lawyer representing some of the cases from former customers said earlier this month that the reported resolution of the state matters was ""good news"" for his clients because it cleared out ""distractions"".
""We need... attention focused on getting to a global talc powder settlement in 2024. This helps,"" Ronald Miller said in a statement.
Johnson & Johnson stopped US sales of its talc-based baby powder in 2020, citing ""misinformation"" that had sapped demand for the product, applied to prevent nappy rash and for other cosmetic uses, including dry shampoo. It later announced plans to end sales globally.
Before that decision, the company had sold the baby powder for almost 130 years. It continues to sell a version of the product that contains corn-starch.

BBC NI's former political editor Mr Grimason and former UTV political editor Ken Reid received the Queen's University Belfast Chancellor's Medals.
The two men covered some of the worst atrocities of the Troubles before chronicling the peace process.
Both attended a special reception at the university to be formally recognised for services to journalism.
Mr Grimason was the BBC's political editor at the time of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.
He was the first reporter at Stormont to receive the document and break the news of the deal.
Mr Reid joined UTV in 1994 and led the channel's coverage of politics for several decades. He stepped down from the role of political editor in 2021.
The Queen's University Belfast Chancellor's Medals were introduced in 2023 as part of a conference marking the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.
The awards were created to celebrate achievement in civic leadership in all its aspects.
Speaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme, Mr Reid said that it was ""fantastic"" to receive the honour.
""Both of us could say that we had a career that we loved,"" he said.
""We're very good friends by the way, we were rivals for years but we were always good friends.""
Mr Grimason echoed the sentiment: ""We'd have killed each for a story but we were always good friends, we could have a pint afterwards.""
Reflecting on a career highlight he said: ""For a wee lad from Mourne View to sit in the Oval Office with his bum on the resolute desk... I thought when that happened: this isn't bad.""
The university's president and vice-chancellor, Prof Sir Ian Greer, said both men had made a truly remarkable contribution to journalism for more than 40 years.
""Ken and Stephen will be the first recipients from their profession to receive the Queen's University Chancellor Medals and I can think of no more deserving individuals to break this new ground,"" he said.
""The Troubles saw some world-class journalism emanate from [Northern Ireland] and they provided a vital public service during the dark days of fear and uncertainty.""
Mr Grimason, originally from Lurgan, Co Armagh, and Mr Reid, who is from Belfast, first met while working as young journalists at former newspaper the Belfast News.
They continued to work as colleagues at the News Letter before working as political correspondents at BBC Northern Ireland and UTV.
Recently both men have spoken of their battles with cancer."
KSJQL1NDIR_E8EWSF1P1RO7SG5,British man Aditya Verma appears in Spanish court over plane-bomb hoax,By Laura Gozzi,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68056421,"A British man accused of public disorder after joking about blowing up a flight has gone on trial in Spain.
Aditya Verma made the comment on Snapchat on his way to the island of Menorca with friends in July 2022.
The message, sent before Mr Verma departed Gatwick airport, read: ""On my way to blow up the plane (I'm a member of the Taliban).""
Mr Verma told a Madrid court on Monday: ""The intention was never to cause public distress or cause public harm.""
If found guilty, the university student faces a hefty bill for expenses after two Spanish Air Force jets were scrambled.
Mr Verma's message was picked up by the UK security services who flagged it to Spanish authorities while the easyJet plane was still in the air.
A court in Madrid heard it was assumed the message triggered alarm bells after being picked up via Gatwick's Wi-Fi network.
Shortly after, the court was told two Spanish F-18 fighter jets were sent to flank the aircraft.
One jet followed the plane until it landed at Menorca, where the plane was searched extensively.
Mr Verma, who was 18 at the time, was arrested. He was kept in a police cell for two days and was later released on bail, the court was told.
Back in the UK, he was questioned by the British intelligence agencies MI5 and MI6, before he returned home to Orpington, Kent.
Appearing in court on Monday, Mr Verma - who is now studying economics at Bath University - said the message was ""a joke in a private group setting"".
""It was just sent to my friends I was travelling with on the day,"" he said.
Pressed about the purpose of the message, Mr Verma said: ""Since school, it's been a joke because of my features... It was just to make people laugh.""
Asked what he thought when he saw the fighter jets flanking the plane, Mr Verma said: ""The Russia-Ukraine war was happening so I thought it was a military exercise related to [that] conflict.""
He said that the plane's pilot made an announcement, telling passengers that the fighter jets had been scrambled because of a distress signal that had been sent by mistake.
Police experts told the court that they combed Mr Verma's phone and, although they found that he had researched clashes between Pakistan and India and the possibilities of an Islamic State attack in that area, they did not find anything of interest that linked Mr Verma to jihadist radicalism.
Mr Verma is not facing terrorism charges or a possible jail term, but could be fined up to â¬22,500 (Â£19,300) if found guilty and the Spanish defence ministry is demanding â¬95,000 in expenses.
The court told the BBC that a verdict in Mr Verma's case would come in the next few days."

L19XP6KTCO_6TJJ27CZKT72YNX,Ofsted: Head teachers can request pause as inspections resume,By Vanessa Clarke,7 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-68030202,"School inspections in England will resume this week after a fortnight's pause to give lead inspectors mental health awareness training.
The training was ordered by Ofsted's new chief inspector,Â Sir Martyn Oliver, who took up the role in January.
Head teachers, academy trusts and local authorities can also now ask for an inspection to be paused.
It follows an inquest into the suicide of Ruth Perry which found an inspection ""contributed"" to her death.
Sir Martyn said ""such tragedies should never happen again"".
Mrs Perry took her own life after an Ofsted report downgraded Caversham Primary School in Reading, where she was head teacher, from its highest rating to its lowest over safeguarding concerns. The inquest into her death heard no child had come to harm.
The senior coroner at Mrs Perry's inquest, Heidi Connor, warned of a risk of further deaths ""unless action is taken"", and wrote a Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) notice.
It highlighted areas of concern including ""the almost complete absence of Ofsted training"" for inspectors looking for signs of distress in school leaders, or for pausing an inspection.
Ofsted has since made some changes, and has introduced a policy where an inspection can be paused usually until the next day, but it could be for up to five working days. This would be in exceptional circumstances - for example, where the head teacher requires support - and it would not affect the inspection grade.
Ofsted said that inspectors will contact schools which are due inspections this week to talk through the new changes and inform them that head teachers can complain about an inspection to a national hotline without fear of consequences.
All school inspectors must have completed mental health training before they lead an inspection.
Responding to the PFD notice from the coroner on Friday, Sir Martyn apologised sincerely for the part Ofsted's inspection played in Mrs Perry's death.
An independent expert will be appointed to lead a learning review of Ofsted's response to the head teacher's death.
Over the next three months, Ofsted will also explore having safeguarding as a standalone judgement, rather than part of the leadership and management grade. Mrs Perry's school was downgraded on safeguarding but all other aspects of the school were good.
""We know we still need to do more, and we will do more,"" Sir Martyn said, adding ""nothing is off the table"".
Head teacher unions have said ""far-reaching fundamental reform is still required"" and the changes introduced must be the start of that process.
The early years sector, including nurseries, also welcomed ""a more compassionate approach to visits"" but Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said the changes must apply ""to all sectors under Ofsted's remit"".
The Department for Education is working with Ofsted to make changes, and said that a call for evidence on how to better support school leaders on safeguarding will be launched in the spring.

L6NPF7VQWI_VSADQN2WLQ01AOC,Kenneth Eugene Smith: UN condemns Alabama nitrogen gas execution,_,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68109309,"This video can not be played
Watch: Witnesses describe Smith's last moments before death
The UN, EU and anti-death penalty activists have condemned the first execution of a prisoner using nitrogen gas.
Kenneth Eugene Smith was put to death Thursday night at a state prison in Atmore, Alabama.
A journalist who witnessed the execution told the BBC that Smith thrashed violently on the gurney.
Smith was convicted in 1989 of murdering a preacher's wife, Elizabeth Sennett, in a killing-for-hire.
The execution process began at 19:53 local time (01:53 GMT) and Smith was pronounced dead about half of an hour later at 20:25 (02:35 GMT).
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, said he had ""serious concerns this novel and untested method of suffocation by nitrogen gas may amount to torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment"".
In a statement, EU officials called nitrogen gas ""a particularly cruel and unusual punishment"".
One of the five reporters who witnessed the execution told the BBC it was unlike any other he'd seen.
""I've been to four previous executions and I've never seen a condemned inmate thrash in the way that Kenneth Smith reacted to the nitrogen gas,"", Alabama journalist Lee Hedgepeth told the BBC's Newsday programme.
""Kenny just began to gasp for air repeatedly and the execution took about 25 minutes total.""
Inhaling pure nitrogen gas cuts off the oxygen supply to the brain. The procedure had never been used before in an execution, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Alabama officials had said in an earlier court filing they expected Smith to lose consciousness within seconds and die in a matter of minutes.
Smith's spiritual adviser, the Reverend Jeff Hood, said after the execution: ""I think that anybody that witnessed this knows that we didn't see someone go unconscious in two or three seconds.""
""What we saw was minutes of someone struggling for their life,"" Mr Hood said. ""We also saw cracks in correction officials in the room who were visibly surprised at how bad this thing went.""
State officials, meanwhile, said the execution went as planned.
John Hamm, commissioner of the Alabama Department of Corrections, said it ""appeared that Smith was holding his breath as long as he could.""
""He struggled against restraints a little bit, but there's some involuntary movement and some abnormal breathing,"" he told a post-execution briefing. ""That was all expected and was in the side effects that we've seen or researched on nitrogen hypoxia"".
""Nothing was out of the ordinary,"" he added.
At a press conference on Friday, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said he expected the method to be used in the future and by other states. Oklahoma and Mississippi have also authorised nitrogen gas for executions.
""Despite the international effort by activists to undermine and disparage our state's justice system and to deny justice to the victims of heinous murders, our proven method offers a blueprint for other states and a warning to those who would contemplate shedding innocent blood,"" he said in a statement after the execution on Thursday.
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Friday that the Biden administration found the execution ""very troubling"" and that it would continue to enforce a moratorium on executions to be carried out by the federal government.
Smith's last words were, according to a media pool report: ""Tonight Alabama caused humanity to take a step backward. I'm leaving with love, peace and light. Thank you for supporting me. Love all of you.""
He also made an ""I love you"" sign with sign language, reporters said.

Watch: How nitrogen became a form of execution in the US
Smith was one of two men convicted of murdering Mrs Sennett.
Her husband Charles Sennett, a debt-ridden preacher, paid them $1,000 (Â£790) to carry out the murder so that he could collect insurance money. He killed himself as investigators closed in.
Mrs Sennett was beaten with a fireplace tool and stabbed in the chest and neck, and her death was staged to look like a home invasion and burglary.
At his trial Smith admitted to being present when she was killed, but said he did not take part in the attack.
Smith's fellow hitman, John Forrest Parker, was executed in 2010.
Mike Sennett, the victim's son, said the family wouldn't be celebrating but that Smith had paid his ""debt"".
""Nothing that happened here today is going to bring Mom back,"" he said. ""We're glad this day is over.""
In a statement, Smith's legal team said it was ""deeply saddened"" by his execution, noting the jury in his case had voted to spare his life but a judge overrode its decision.
American opponents of the death penalty also condemned the execution.
""It's not something that should be done, and yet it was done,"" said Abraham Bonowitz, executive director of Death Penalty Action.

Mike Sennett, son of murder victim Elizabeth Sennett, says Smith has ""paid his debt""
Alabama tried to execute Smith by lethal injection two years ago, but prison staff had trouble inserting an intravenous line.
On Thursday night, the US Supreme Court denied him a last-minute reprieve. Three liberal justices dissented from the conservative majority's ruling.
The death penalty is on decline in the US.
Last year 24 people were put to death with lethal injections in five states: Texas, Florida, Missouri, Oklahoma and Alabama.
A slight majority - 53% - of Americans approve of the death penalty in murder cases, according to a long-running Gallup poll.

L74FFMBG5H_725G6CNXY476I7H,India calls Pakistan's claim of targeted killings 'false',By Meryl Sebastian,3 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-68091822,"India has dismissed allegations by Pakistan that its agents killed two Pakistani citizens on its soil in 2023, calling them ""false"".
Pakistan's claims come months after Ottawa alleged that India was involved in the murder of a Sikh separatist in Canada - India has denied this.
On Thursday, Islamabad said it had ""credible evidence"" of links between the two killings and Indian agents.
India's foreign ministry called it ""malicious anti-India propaganda"".
The two deaths in Pakistan include the killing of Muhammad Riaz in Rawalakot city in September 2023 and Shahid Latif in Sialkot city in October 2023, the country's foreign ministry said in a press briefing on Thursday. One of the men was shot dead while praying at a mosque, while the other was killed outside one.
Pakistan's foreign ministry did not disclose who these people were or the reasons for Delhi allegedly dispatching agents to carry out the killings within its arch-rival's territory.
Foreign Secretary Muhammad Syrus Qazi called the killings ""unacceptable"" and ""a violation of its sovereignty"".
""We have documentary, financial and forensic evidence of the involvement of the two Indian agents who masterminded these assassinations,"" he said.
India must be held ""accountable"" for its ""blatant violation of international law"", he added.
India did not directly address the specific allegations raised by Pakistan but called the country an ""epicentre of terrorism, organised crime and illegal transnational activities"".
""India and many other countries have publicly warned Pakistan cautioning that it would consume by its own culture of terror and violence,"" its foreign ministry said in a statement.
Mr Qazi also said that the killings in Pakistan were similar to attempts in Canada and the US - though those allegations were about the murders or attempted murders of Sikhs, not Muslims.
In November 2023, the US said it had foiled an alleged plot by an Indian man to assassinate an American citizen in New York who advocated for Khalistan, or a separate Sikh state.
Nikhil Gupta was allegedly directed by an Indian government official who was not named or charged in the indictment.
The White House said it had raised the alleged assassination plot with India at the most senior levels. India said it had formed a high-level inquiry committee to ""address the security concerns highlighted by the US government"".
The news came months after Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there was ""credible"" evidence connecting the Indian government to the murder of a Sikh leader in British Columbia in June. India denied any role in that killing.
The allegation led to a steep deterioration in ties between the two countries.
The Khalistan movement peaked in India in the 1980s with a violent insurgency centred in Sikh-majority Punjab state.
It was quelled by force and has little resonance in India now, but is still popular among some in the Sikh diaspora in countries such as Canada, Australia and the UK.

L7UTSHH4M2_20ZG4ML9N1FBUZU,Nottingham attacks: NHS to investigate Valdo Calocane's case,By Rob Sissons,3 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-68092057,"NHS England is to order a major investigation into triple killer Valdo Calocane's contact with mental health services, stretching back four years.
The 32-year-old fatally stabbed students Barnaby Webber and Grace O'Malley-Kumar, before killing school caretaker Ian Coates last June.
A court heard he had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.
The Independent Mental Health Homicide Review will examine what can be learned from the case.
On Thursday, Calocane was sentenced to a hospital order, after pleading guilty to three counts of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility, and three counts of attempted murder.
It has since been confirmed that the attorney general's office has received a referral arguing the sentence was unduly lenient.
Among the questions the NHS England investigation is likely to examine is whether the killings could have been predicted or prevented.
At Calocane's sentencing hearing, it was revealed the former University of Nottingham student believed MI5 was spying on him.
His mental illness began in 2019 and he had been detained under the Mental Health Act at a psychiatric unit in Nottingham four times since May 2020.
On each occasion, he was discharged - the final time in February 2022, more than a year before the killings.
He was prescribed anti-psychotic medication but stopped taking it, which the prosecution said led to a further decline in his mental health.
Families of Calocane's victims have questioned the care received by the killer in the years leading up to the attacks.
Grace O'Malley-Kumar's father, Dr Sanjoy Kumar, said: ""While we have never questioned this man's diagnosis, the lack of toxicology, contemporaneous mental health assessment, as well as missed opportunities to divert his lethal path will forever play on our minds and this requires further review.
""We will look for answers regarding missed opportunities to intervene and prevent this horrendous crime.""
Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, which runs mental health services in the county, said in a statement it had ""robustly"" reviewed its interactions with Calocane.
Chief executive Ifti Majid said: ""It is important to remember that this person has been convicted of a crime of the most serious kind and there are many people who live with severe mental health issues who do not offend and are supported to live well in their community.
""We always aim to care for people in the least restrictive way and to support people to live well in their own homes and society.
""If a patient no longer engages with our services and support and they do not meet criteria to be detained under the Mental Health Act, they are discharged back to the care of their GP and can be referred back into our services at any time.""
The exact terms of reference of the independent review and the panel that will lead it have yet to be appointed.
It is expected it will take many months to complete.
Dr Mike Harris, a consultant psychiatrist and former director of Rampton high-security hospital in Nottinghamshire, said examining whether the attacks could have been prevented would be a ""very difficult question"".
He said: ""Essentially it goes back to the observation when he was admitted to hospital nearly a year and a half earlier.
""Was there anything in his presentation at that time that would have given any clue to the fact that he might become violent in the future?
""It could be there were reasons to follow him up and the follow-up failed for some reason, and in a way that is the most important thing an inquiry can look at.
""Did he get better during his admission in 2022 and when he had that, did they arrange appropriate follow-up and did that follow-up happen?""

LQ7K4X4W1J_YESG2WTZNDFHND9,Chunk of Highlands 'needs island-style health care',_,26 January 2024,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c904qj311qvo,"Caithness health campaigners have called for an Orkney health care model
A large chunk of the Highland mainland should have an island-style health service, say campaigners.
Caithness Health Action Team (Chat) said its area needed Orkney's model of provision due to how far patients have to travel to access key services.
It said 90% of local pregnant women gave birth at Inverness' Raigmore Hospital - more than 100 miles away from the main Caithness towns of Wick and Thurso.
The Scottish government and NHS Highland said they working together to provide safe and sustainable services.

Listen to news from the Highlands and Islands on BBC Sounds
Chat has long campaigned for more services to be made available locally.
It has repeated the call after severe winter weather last week closed the A9, the main route to Inverness.
But Chat chairman Ron Gunn said the trunk road could be blocked any time of the year, including by fallen trees and road accidents.
He said: ""We have something like 7,000 patients a year going down as outpatients to Inverness.
""There are also dental patients who have to go down, including hundreds of young people.""
Mr Gunn said among the changes wanted included having Caithness' midwife-led maternity unit supported by a consultant like Orkney's.
He said this would mean more mothers being able to have their babies closer to home.
""We have been trying to get island status for a number of years,"" said Mr Gunn.
""We need to try and be as self-sufficient as possible.""
NHS Highland said it worked closely with the Scottish Ambulance Service which it said had established protocols in situations of adverse weather to ensure emergency transfers could take place.
A health board spokesperson said: ""If road transportation is not available, as has been the case due to the recent adverse weather, patients can be transferred by air ambulance or coastguard.""
NHS Highland said Caithness' midwifery unit was now fully established after it was first set up in 2017.
It said local births were an option for women who had low-risk pregnancies.
The spokesperson added: ""There is no change in the current service provision as it stands and there is no external independent review at this time.
""We are, however, internally reviewing our services, the performance and improvement potential in line with the quality and safety requirements we have to work within and the resources available to us.""
The Scottish government said safe care as close to home as practicable was vital.
A spokesperson said: ""We recognise the concerns that adverse weather conditions can bring, and the wider challenges facing rural and island health boards.
""NHS Highland is working closely with local people and campaign groups, to develop safe, flexible and sustainable services that are accessible and best meet the needs of local people, including maternity services.â

LQJ7EIFGV6_KVCFCFTGC6ZRYUB,UNRWA claims: UK halts aid to UN agency over allegation staff helped Hamas attack,By Sarah Fowler & Lipika Pelham,1 day ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68104203,"Several countries including the UK have paused funding for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
It comes after the agency announced the sacking of several of its staff over allegations they were involved in the 7 October Hamas attacks.
The UK government said it was ""appalled"" by Israel's allegations.
The US, Australia, Italy, Canada, Finland, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany have also suspended additional funding to the UN agency.
Created in 1949, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, is the biggest UN agency operating in Gaza.
It provides health care, education and other humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. It employs around 13,000 people inside Gaza.
Since Israel began its offensive in response to the 7 October attacks, UNRWA has used its facilities across Gaza to shelter hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians.
It says it has ordered an investigation into information supplied by Israel.
Israel has long accused different branches of the United Nations including UNRWA of bias and even of antisemitism.
Speaking to the BBC, the organisation's former chief spokesperson, Christopher Gunness, said that the suspension of aid to UNRWA was disproportionate and can only lead to further suffering in Gaza.
Mr Gunness believes UNRWA has demonstrated its zero-tolerance policy by sacking the staff members before their internal investigation was complete.
""One million displaced people are currently taking refuge in and around UNRWA buildings. They are the ones who will suffer as a result of this decision,"" said Mr Gunness, adding: ""The curtailing of UNRWA services will also destabilise the region at a time when Western governments are trying to contain a regional conflagration.""
On Friday, an adviser to the Israeli prime minister told the BBC that the 7 October Hamas attacks had involved ""people who are on their [UNRWA] salaries"".
Mark Regev said there was information showing teachers working in UNRWA schools had ""openly celebrated"" the 7 October attacks.
He also referred to an Israeli hostage who, on her release, said she had been ""held in the house of someone who worked for UNRWA"".
""They have a union which is controlled by Hamas and I think it's high time that the UN investigated these links between UNRWA and Hamas,"" he added.
The allegations prompted reaction from major donors.
""The UK is appalled by allegations that UNRWA staff were involved in the 7 October attack against Israel, a heinous act of terrorism that the UK Government has repeatedly condemned,"" the UK Foreign Office said in a statement.
""The UK is temporarily pausing any future funding of UNWRA whilst we review these concerning allegations,"" it added.
Earlier, the US State Department announced that it was suspending additional funding to the UN agency, saying it was ""extremely troubled"" by the allegations of UN staff involvement in the attacks.
The EU said that it would assess further steps ""based on the result of the full and comprehensive investigation"".
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was ""horrified by this news"".
The head of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, said a full investigation into the allegations was being carried out ""to establish the truth without delay.""
""To protect the agency's ability to deliver humanitarian assistance, I have taken the decision to immediately terminate the contracts of these staff members,"" Mr Lazzarini added.
He said any staff found to have been involved in ""acts of terror"" would be held accountable.
Israel's Foreign Minister, Israel Katz said he aimed to stop UNRWA operating in Gaza after the war.
But the Palestinian Authority's minister for civilian affairs, Hussein Al-Sheikh, said the decision by some countries to pause support for the vital UN agency ""entails great political and humanitarian relief risks"".
Mr al-Sheikh urged Western donors to immediately reverse their decision, adding: ""We need the maximum support for this international organisation.""
The Irish deputy premier, MicheÃ¡l Martin, said his country had no plans to suspend its funding for the agency, saying it provided ""life saving assistance to 2.3m people and at incredible personal cost - with over 100 staff killed in last four months"".
In a post on Telegram, Hamas's press office said the group urged the UN and the international organisations ""to not cave in to the threats and blackmail"" from Israel.
Hamas killed around 1,300 people, mostly civilians, in the unprecedented attack on southern Israeli communities on 7 October last year.
Another 250 people were taken hostage. The events triggered Israel's retaliatory attacks on Hamas in Gaza, which have killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
The US, Germany and the EU are among some of UNRWA's biggest donors.
The agency says it is struggling to get humanitarian aid to many of the estimated 1.7 million people - nearly three-quarters of the population - displaced by 12 weeks of fighting.
A number of UN facilities where Gazans had taken shelter have been hit in Israeli air strikes.
On Wednesday, 12 people were killed when a UN shelter was struck in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.

LTIF3Z9Q99_U177HHKI5VHJ6NY,"Igor Girkin shot down a passenger jet, then insulted Putin. Which one put him in jail?",By Steve Rosenberg,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68091877,"The last time I saw Igor Girkin was five years ago in the stairwell of a Moscow news agency.
""Would you consider giving me an interview?"" I asked. ""No,"" he replied sharply and scurried away.
I saw him again today. No stairwell. This time, Girkin was in a caged dock surrounded by police in the Moscow City Court.
Along with other media we were allowed in to film him for just one minute before the end of his trial.
A police dog kept barking. Girkin found that amusing. The verdict less so. Minutes later he was found guilty on extremism charges and sentenced to four years in a penal colony.
This wasn't his first conviction.
In The Hague in 2022, in absentia, Girkin was found guilty of the murder of 298 people: the passengers and crew of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17.
The Boeing jet had been shot down over eastern Ukraine in 2014 by Russian-controlled forces in the early stages of Russia's war there.
Girkin was one of three men sentenced to life imprisonment. A judgement he ignored.
A year after we'd met in the stairwell, I managed to get through to Girkin on the phone and ask him about the Hague.
""I do not recognise the authority of the Dutch court on this matter,"" he told me.
""I am a military man and I am not going to accept that a civilian court in a foreign country has the authority to convict a person who took part in someone else's civil war, only because their civilians were killed.
""Do you know who shot down [the plane]?""
""The rebels didn't shoot down the Boeing. I have nothing more to say.""
This video can not be played
Russian rebel commander Igor Girkin told the BBC in 2020 he did not recognise the court's authority
""If it wasn't the rebels, then was it Russian soldiers?"" I asked.
""That's it. Goodbye."" He hung up.
Now he is going to prison. But not for mass murder. And not for life.
So, who exactly is Girkin - also known under his pseudonym as Igor Strelkov - and why has a Moscow court sent him to jail?
He is a former FSB officer in Russia's domestic security service. In 2014 he played a key role in the fighting in Ukraine's Donbas region: a conflict engineered and orchestrated by Moscow.
He organised and commanded pro-Russia militias in eastern Ukraine.
The Dutch court would later rule that Russia had been in control of the separatist forces fighting in eastern Ukraine and that Girkin had helped to bring the Buk missile system into Ukraine that was used to shoot down flight MH17.
Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, ultranationalist Girkin became a prominent pro-war blogger.
He became increasingly critical of the way the Russian authorities were waging the war: not hard enough, in his view.
He founded a hard line nationalist movement called The Club of Angry Patriots.
His problems began when he started to take that anger out on President Vladimir Putin.
Public criticisms of the Russian president turned to insults. In a post last year, Girkin described Putin as ""a non-entity"" and ""a cowardly waste of space"".
A few days later he was arrested. Now he's been tried and convicted.
Of course, a four-year prison sentence is mild in comparison to other recent punishments delivered by Russian courts.
Last year pro-democracy activist Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to a quarter of a century behind bars after being convicted of treason, a case he and his supporters insist was politically motivated.
How would the ""Angry Patriots"" react to Girkin's prison term? Would they pour on to the streets in protest?
Not exactly. A few dozen supporters gathered outside the Moscow City Court to chant ""Freedom to Strelkov!"" but there was little hint of optimism in their voices.
""They've put a Russian national patriot on trial,"" Denis tells me. ""I hope our people wake up and fight. Unfortunately, we don't see much pushback. Everyone seems to be hiding away.""
Also in the crowd was retired colonel and outspoken ultranationalist Vladimir Kvachkov.
Having informed me that ""Russia will always be the enemy of the Anglo-Saxon West"" and assured me that the break-up of the United Kingdom was inevitable, Mr Kvachkov claimed that Girkin was being punished for ""fighting against the system.""
In recent years the ""system"" concentrated on clearing the Russian political landscape of pro-democracy, pro-Western critics and challengers.
A prison sentence for Girkin suggests the Russian authorities have now decided to crack down on critics from the opposite end of the spectrum: the so-called ultra-patriots.
Last year's mutiny by Wagner mercenaries led by Yevgeny Prigozhin may be the reason.
The Putin system survived the challenge. But that drama will have alerted the Kremlin to the potential dangers from highly motivated nationalistic and patriotic elements in Russian society.

LUADQLOS6R_IGPGFQ0UCUC4OVC,Turkey parliament backs Sweden's Nato membership,By George Wright,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68076829,"Turkish MPs have ratified Sweden's bid to join Nato in a long-delayed vote that represents a big step forward on the Nordic nation's path to membership.
Sweden applied to join in 2022 after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but Turkey withheld approval amid a row over what it called Sweden's support to Kurdish separatists.
Turkish President Erdogan is expected to sign the legislation within days.
It leaves Hungary the sole Nato member yet to ratify Sweden's accession.
Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson posted on social media: ""Today we are one step closer to becoming a full member of Nato"".
And Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed Turkey's vote, saying he was counting on Hungary to ""complete its national ratification as soon as possible"".
Hungary has accused Sweden of having a hostile attitude. In March Hungarian government spokesman ZoltÃ¡n KovÃ¡cs accused officials in Sweden of sitting on a ""crumbling throne of moral superiority"". Stockholm has previously accused the Hungarian government of backsliding on the EU's democratic principles.
However there have been signs of progress. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Tuesday invited his Swedish counterpart to Budapest for talks, stating in a letter that ""a more intensive dialogue could contribute to reinforcing trust"".
Sweden's Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom said he saw ""no reason"" to negotiate with Hungary ""at this point"", but added that the two nations ""can have a dialogue and continue to discuss questions"".
Turkey had been blocking Sweden's application until July, when an agreement was reached. On Tuesday evening lawmakers voted 287-55 in favour of Swedish membership. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is now expected to sign the legislation.
Turkey had argued Sweden was giving refuge to Kurdish militants, and needed to do more to crack down on rebel groups like the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which it considers a terrorist organisation. The EU and US have also designated the PKK as a terrorist group.
Like any of Nato's 31 member countries, Turkey has the power to block new nations from joining the group.
But Sweden introduced tougher anti-terrorism laws in June, making it illegal to give financial or logistical help to terrorist groups.
Sweden and its eastern neighbour Finland, both long considered as militarily neutral, announced their intention to join Nato in May 2022, several months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Finland formally joined in April, doubling the length of the alliance's border with Russia.

LVP4Z93C98_A5JITU3KWAPTWH4,Ryan Vincent: Holiday park guards not trained in restraint - inquest,By Phil Bodmer,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-68072065,"A security guard who restrained a man at a North Yorkshire holiday park had not been trained in physical intervention, an inquest heard.
Ryan Vincent, 22, from Skelton, died in hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest after being pinned to the floor at Primrose Valley, Filey, in May 2017.
Northallerton Coroner's Court previously heard he was held face down on the ground for about 20 minutes.
Witnesses have told the hearing he had been heard to say ""I can't breathe"".
Giving evidence on Tuesday, Anthony Hoyland from the Security Industry Authority (SIA) said the ""clear advice"" from the industry was that physical intervention is ""positively discouraged"".
He added that the ""clear advice is to allow the person being restrained to stand up as soon as possible"".
He said training would ensure staff understood the law regarding physical intervention, the limits of arrest powers and first aid.
However, Paul Robinson, facilities support operations manager for Haven, the owners of Primrose Valley, said the security personnel on the night of the incident had not received training around physical intervention.
Asked by coroner Jonathan Heath about the role of security staff at the park he said the job included monitoring guests entering and leaving the park, managing requests from guests, handling out-of-hours emergencies and patrolling the site.
Mr Robinson said all security personnel were assessed, qualified and underwent an interview process before being hired.
Asked if he had checked if staff had been trained in physical intervention he replied: ""Personally no"".
He said they had taken copies of the licences of the security staff, but it did not include details of their training.
The coroner asked if he had made an assumption the two security staff working on the night of incident had been trained in physical intervention and he replied ""yes"".
The inquest was told the two security guards who restrained Mr Vincent had worked at the caravan park for a number of years and were experienced members of staff.
Earlier, park guest Greg Chapman described seeing Mr Vincent on the floor.
He said he was ""a few feet away"" and could see one of the security guards had his outstretched hands and arms on Mr Vincent's back, however he had not heard him ""say anything"".
Asked if a second member of security staff had done anything to help Mr Vincent, he said ""no"".
The inquest continues.

Restrained man could not breathe - inquest hears

LWBT11SV5W_Z7E0RV74YVWG2D0,Dozens reported killed as battle rages in Gaza's Khan Younis,By David Gritten,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68055933,"Dozens of people are reported to have been killed in intense Israeli strikes on Khan Younis in the south Gaza Strip, as battles between soldiers and Hamas fighters rage on the ground.
Residents said tanks had surrounded a hospital and university where thousands of displaced people were sheltering.
Ambulances were also trapped and unable to reach the wounded.
Khan Younis has been a recent focus of Israeli forces, who are convinced top Hamas commanders are holed up there.
On Sunday, the Israeli military said it had found an underground compound in the city where it believed about 20 Israeli hostages had been held.
Meanwhile in Israel, a number of hostages' families on Monday interrupted a finance committee meeting at the Israeli parliament in Jerusalem, to call for the government to do more to secure their release.
One relative shouted: ""We won't let you breathe until our kids come back.""

As the US, Qatar and Egypt try to mediate, Hamas has demanded that Israel ends the war and withdraws its forces before the hostages are released.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected such a deal, saying it would amount to a capitulation to ""monsters"" and mean soldiers had ""fallen in vain"".
But on Monday evening the US news website Axios quoted two US officials as saying Israel had given Hamas a proposal that included a two-month pause in fighting in return for the phased release of all remaining hostages in Gaza.
Hamas gunmen took about 250 people hostage and killed 1,300 others when they carried out an unprecedented cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, Israeli authorities say.
At least 25,295 people have been killed in Gaza since the Israeli military launched a large-scale air and ground campaign in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. More are believed dead under rubble.
On Monday Israeli tanks were reported to have advanced into western areas of Khan Younis and closed in on the city's two main hospitals following a night of heavy bombardment.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said Israeli forces were besieging the area around al-Amal Hospital, which it runs, as well as its headquarters and nearby ambulance centre, and that it was deeply concerned about the safety of staff, patients and displaced civilians inside them.
""The area now is extremely dangerous. They are hearing strong bombing in the area,"" spokeswoman Nebal Farsakh told Al Jazeera TV. ""Everyone who tries to move out or who goes out in the street is being targeted.""
She added that PRCS ambulances were trapped and unable to respond to reach wounded people in the area, and that a telecommunications blackout meant staff were only able to contact each other via VHF radios.
Smoke was also seen rising and gunfire heard in the vicinity of Nasser Hospital, the largest medical facility still functioning in Gaza.
Palestinian media cited the hospital's surgical director as reporting that it had received 50 dead and more than 100 wounded since the night.
Gaza's health ministry said dozens had been killed or wounded west of Khan Younis on Monday, and that people had been forced to bury 40 bodies inside the grounds of Nasser Hospital because it was not safe outside.
A doctor in the emergency department told Reuters that the hospital was overwhelmed by casualties and ""on the brink of collapse"".
""With the siege on the neighbourhoods close to Nasser [hospital], it is very difficult to deliver medical aid to the hospital, and it is very difficult to continue treating the patients,"" Ahmed Abu Mustafa said, adding that there were ""no pain killers, no anaesthesia, or any medical resources"".
A health ministry spokesman also told Reuters that Israeli troops had stormed the al-Khair Hospital in the al-Mawasi area, west of Khan Younis.
On Monday White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Israel was obliged under international law to protect innocent people in Gaza hospitals as much as possible.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the reports from the three hospitals. However, it has previously accused Hamas of operating inside and around medical facilities - a claim the group has denied.
Shelling was also reported around the Al-Aqsa University, in al-Mawasi, where thousands of displaced people are staying.
""We can't leave... it's dangerous and I fear for the little ones,"" Younis Abdel Razek, who was sheltering there with his family, told AFP news agency. ""They said the al-Mawasi area was safe, but they lied.""
The Israeli military has told civilians to move for their own safety to what it calls a ""humanitarian zone"" in al-Mawasi. The thin strip of mainly agricultural land runs along the Mediterranean coast, south-west of Khan Younis.
The UN estimates that 1.7 million people have been displaced by the past 15 weeks of fighting, many of them multiple times.
UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres warned on Saturday that disease and hunger were ""deepening"" among them.
""People are dying not only from bombs and bullets, but from lack of food and clean water, hospitals without power and medicine, and gruelling journeys to ever-smaller slivers of land to escape the fighting,"" he said. ""This must stop."""
LX236X8TCK_V497N9JYBWC97IG,Post Office investigator says cleared sub-postmaster was guilty,By Sam Gruet & Myranda Mowafi,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68009769,"A former Post Office investigator has said he still believes a branch manager, whose conviction was overturned after his death, stole money from his Post Office.
Raymond Grant told the Horizon IT inquiry on Wednesday, that he considered William Quarm to be guilty.
Mr Quarm pleaded guilty in 2010 to embezzling money, to try to avoid going to prison.
He died in 2012, aged 69, before his conviction was quashed.
His widow, Anne, told the BBC she was ""astonished"" that Mr Grant would say this, and that Mr Grant being compelled to attend the inquiry ""says it all about his attitude"".
Mrs Quarm previously told the BBC the threat of jail had been devastating. ""The fear in his eyes - I'll never forget it,"" she said.
Mr Quarm ran a Post Office branch in North Uist, Scotland. After his conviction he was ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.
Speaking to the public inquiry, which is tasked with finding out how the UK's biggest miscarriage of justice took place, the ex-investigator eventually broke down in tears and apologised.
But earlier he told the inquiry he still believed Mr Quarm's conviction had been correct.
The former sub-postmaster, Mr Quarm had raised concerns about the ATM at his branch and possible errors in an interview with Robert Daily, another Post Office investigator in 2008.
Mr Quarm also said he was waiting for a bank loan to make good the Â£40,277.76 shortage found by auditors at his branch.
Mr Grant objected to the demands the inquiry was making on him, saying his ""time was limited"". He had submitted a ""minimum"" witness statement to the inquiry, that was only a little over two pages long.
He blamed this on working ""10 to 11-hour days"" at a Christian shelter. He said he was particularly busy in December with that paid work, and moving house.
""I was going home, walking my dog and at the same time, the home where I was living, I was asked to vacate it by December 31,"" he told the inquiry.
Mr Grant also complained he hadn't been paid for the time he had spent preparing to give evidence to the inquiry, adding he had been made to conduct research ""in my own personal time"" and had ""spent some time in my sick bed reading"" while preparing to give evidence.
Counsel to the inquiry, Jason Beer KC, asked the former investigator: ""When you made a witness statement, did you think that Mr Quarm continued to be guilty of the crime of embezzlement?""
Mr Grant replied: ""Yes I did.""
There were at times long pauses between questions as Mr Grant's answers came. When asked whether he still believed Mr Quarm was guilty he said: ""Yes I do.""
The counsel to the inquiry went on: ""Despite the verdict of the High Court of Judiciary in Scotland?
Mr Grant said: ""Yes.""
Asked whether that remained his view, the former investigator said: ""In my mind, I still think Mr Quarm had a role to play in the loss of the money.""
The Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh overturned Mr Quarm's conviction last year.
The long-running inquiry into the Post Office scandal is looking at prosecutions brought against sub-postmasters across the UK.
Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters and mistresses after a faulty computer system called Horizon made it look like money was missing.
The government has announced a new law to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate"" all those wrongly convicted.
At the end of his appearance at the inquiry Mr Grant interrupted the session to give a statement, and appeared very emotional.
He said the Post Office had ""deceived [him] and they have deceived an awful lot more people"", adding he was ""humbly sorry"".
""I just hope that people do learn from this and are more honest in the future,"" he told the inquiry.

LZXXXIEJ5Y_5ULX89S68QR0FIQ,The bomb-hunters scouring UK waters for unexploded weapons,By Laurence Cawley,7 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-67946213,"Hundreds of thousands of unexploded bombs and mines carpet the seabed off the UK's coast. Many are known about and mapped, but plenty more are not, posing a potential danger to those working at sea. It is Lee Gooderham's business to find them.
The map projected onto a screen at an industrial estate in Norfolk is the result of 12 years' work.
As Mr Gooderham, founder of Hethel-based Ordtek, zooms in on the English Channel and the southern North Sea, thousands of tiny red dots emerge like scattered confetti.
""Each of those dots is a reported munition,"" he says. ""We are talking hundreds of thousands of items.""
What the map does not show are all the unknown munitions still lurking on the seabed.
""We are finding unexploded ordnance and dealing with it on a daily basis,"" Mr Gooderham says.
""There are many that we don't know about.""
Despite being dropped - or dumped - decades ago, unexploded ordnance (UXO) continues to pose a very real danger to those working in our waters.
""The real problem is when fishing vessels and dredgers encounter unexploded ordnance,"" says Mr Gooderham.
""That is when it becomes dangerous.""
In 2020, fishing vessel Galwad-Y-Mor was thrown into the air when a World War Two bomb exploded 25 miles (40km) north of Cromer, Norfolk.
Five crew members were injured, including one left blinded in one eye.
Skipper Lewis Mulhearn, 39, won a bravery award for saving the lives of his crew.
Mr Mulhearn, who suffered multiple injuries, died in January 2023.
Mr Gooderham's clients, however, are not from the fishing industry, but the offshore and renewables sector.
""Some of their early sites in particular were in high-risk UXO areas, such as Thames Gateway, Gunfleet Sands and those type of areas,"" says Mr Gooderham, whose firm is one of a small number offering consultancy for UXO.
""All of a sudden they were looking to put cables and assets out into the sea in these high-risk areas and, of course, they hadn't really considered that there could be UXO there.
""Scroby Sands, Gunfleet Sands, London Array - all of those got built, very near shore, in high-risk areas.""
The job of finding UXO starts with desk-based work and archive research.
""Once we know there is a risk there and there is a problem, a survey is carried out,"" Mr Gooderham says.
""This involves sending out a vessel with geophysical equipment, a magnetometer, and we oversee that - we are on board the vessel.
""We'll get the data back to the office where it will be processed and they'll say 'We think this is a bomb, that is a bomb, this is a bomb - you need to do something about it.'""
If bombs can be avoided by a minimum of 10m (32ft), they can be left in situ.
""By the time it is on the seabed, it is safe. It is not going to blow up, unless it is interfered with,"" says Mr Gooderham.
""If it cannot be avoided, we use another vessel with a remotely-operated underwater vehicle (ROV).""
Before munitions are detonated, the ROV gently moves sea life, such as crabs and lobsters, out of harm's way.
An example of the bomb-hunting process hangs on the wall of Ordtek's offices.
The munition fragment was found at Race Bank, off the Norfolk coast.
""In this situation we had this target, we predicted it was a bomb and it was, it was this German mine in 25m (82ft) of water, 700kg (1,500lbs) of explosives,"" says Mr Gooderham.
""It made a 50m (164ft) to 70m (229ft) plume when detonated.""
Once the item is destroyed, any debris over 30cm (12in) wide must be collected and properly disposed of.
The whole process, says Mr Gooderham, can cost hundreds of thousands of pounds.
""What is really interesting is when we get abnormal finds, like these dump sites that we did not know were there,"" he says.
""On one project we came across a 4,000lb (1,800kg) bomb, which is very rare. It was a very big bomb, it was British but why it was there we just don't know.
""It was so big it could not be destroyed because of various permit-related issues. It remains there and it is monitored. That was a surprise - when you find a 4,000-pounder, it is a big moment.
""The largest ones you usually come across are the 1,000lb (450kg) bombs.
""The German munitions we come across are often as good as the day they were dropped. The integrity of the explosive within remains intact.""
But clearing the entire seabed would be nearly impossible, he says.
""The German government is looking at this at the moment and it is an unbelievable task.
""They predicted it would take 300 years to clear the seabed of munitions from World War Two and it would cost numbers that are off the chart.
""The interesting thing we are seeing are the numbers of unrecorded dump sites all the way from Gunfleet Sands up to the Hornsea Project, which are level with Hull.
""It is not a very good look for the British military; at the end of World War Two, they just got rid of it.""
While the renewables and offshore energy sectors pay for the work of firms like Ordtek, Mr Gooderham is keen his team's mine-mapping work is available to others working at sea.
They include people like fourth-generation fisherman Steve Stoker, who has caught dozens of unexploded bombs off the Essex coast.
""I caught two in a week once,"" says Mr Stoker.
""You usually know when you've caught a bomb in your nets and you mark it on your GPS and keep away.
""We don't come across them as often now, mainly because we don't wander as far, because there is not as much fish about so we tend to stick in one area.""
His great aunt and great uncle, Horace and Lily Stoker, were killed by a mine in the 1940s while out trawling.
""I know of a couple of boats which have had a bomb explode. One, in Lowestoft, had the bomb go off in the net and it blew the engine off its bed,"" he says.
He also remembers the days when fishermen were paid for the UXO they came across.
""We used to get a lot of unexploded bombs at the entrance to the Thames,"" Mr Stoker says. ""We used to get money for it because they did not want us to chuck them away.
""The Royal Navy used to come down. They'd stay at The Victory [a pub]; they were good old boys and we had some good laughs with them.
""You would put a buoy on it and then leave them [the ordnance] somewhere shallow, take the Royal Navy out to them and they would set the charge and you'd go a certain distance out and they would detonate it.
""They used to go a hell of a way up in the air.
""Then it all changed and they didn't want you to take them out any more - instead they wanted the police to take them out.""
Despite the inherent dangers of unexploded munitions, Mr Stoker says he has ""never been worried about them, really"".
""I used to take a day off from school to go out with my dad and blow a bomb up,"" he says.
""It was quite a regular thing. I learned not to be afraid of them and to not worry.""
A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: ""At the end of World War Two, munitions were disposed of in a variety of places and they continue to be discovered to this day.
""Our explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) teams always respond and deal appropriately with any materials discovered.""

M0TB3BH4BB_3C9OVNQW2IN0DL3,Valdo Calocane: Police did not arrest killer after previous assaults,By Caroline Lowbridge,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-68088389,"Killer Valdo Calocane was reported to police for attacking two people weeks before killing three people in Nottingham - but was not arrested.
Leicestershire Police confirmed the assaults happened less than six weeks before the Nottingham attacks.
The two assault victims were work colleagues at a warehouse in Leicestershire.
The BBC has asked police why Calocane was not arrested, but the force has not explained.
Calocane was sentenced to a hospital order on Thursday for killing 19-year-old students Barnaby Webber and Grace O'Malley-Kumar, and 65-year-old school caretaker Ian Coates.
The attorney general is considering whether judges should review the sentence, following anger from the victims' families about the handling of the case.
Calocane, 32 - who was known to have serious mental health problems - was already a wanted man when he attacked his colleagues, because he had previously assaulted a Nottinghamshire Police officer in September 2021.
Police have not publicly given details of the assault, but Mr Webber's mother Emma said it was ""such a violent assault that he was Tasered"".
He had been charged in relation to this, but failed to turn up at court, so a warrant was issued for his arrest in September 2022 - a year after the assault.
In the meantime, Calocane was in and out of Highbury Hospital due to his mental health problems, and also in the care of a community team.
Despite the warrant, Nottinghamshire Police did not succeed in arresting Calocane and the force has already said that it ""should have done more"" to detain him.
The BBC asked Nottinghamshire Police why they did not arrest Calocane, but the force has not explained.
While the warrant was outstanding, Calocane managed to get a job with Arvato Supply Chain Solutions, at a warehouse the business has near East Midlands Airport.
He started there on 1 May 2023 and assaulted two of his colleagues only four days later.
The business reported the assaults on the same day they happened, and Leicestershire Police attended, but Calocane was no longer there.
A Leicestershire Police spokesman said: ""I can confirm officers were called to the warehouse in Wilders Way, Kegworth, shortly before 6pm on 5 May following a report two people had been assaulted.
""No serious injuries were reported. It was reported Calocane had been escorted from the site by security staff prior to police arriving.
""Our enquiries to establish the full circumstances of the report concerning the incident in Kegworth were ongoing at the time the incident in Nottingham occurred.""
The BBC has asked Leicestershire Police why officers did not find and arrest Calocane afterwards, and asked whether or not officers were aware of the outstanding arrest warrant, but the force would not say.

Nottingham attacks: Victims' families react to triple killer's sentence
Relatives of the three people killed by Calocane have said they feel let down by police.
Referencing Nottinghamshire Police's failure to arrest Calocane, Emma Webber said: ""If you had just done your jobs properly, there's a very good chance my beautiful boy would be alive today.""
Speaking outside court after Calocane was sentenced on Thursday, she expressed her frustration with Nottinghamshire Police for not being open about the details of the arrest warrant.
""It took repeated questioning from us to finally receive an answer late last Friday afternoon to the question of his outstanding warrant, issued September 2022, for a vicious attack on a police officer,"" she said.
She also claimed Nottinghamshire Police had misled the victims' families in relation to Calocane supposedly not having a fixed address.
She said: ""Why were we repeatedly told through the summer that the offender was a sofa surfer and had no real abode?
""Not true. He did. One that was registered in his name in Nottingham, and one that he had been in for six months prior to his eviction on only 11 June last year. Why?""

Calocane has paranoid schizophrenia, and the victims' families are angry with NHS mental health services due to what they believe were failings in how he was treated.
They are also angry with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for accepting Calocane's manslaughter pleas, rather than prosecuting him for murder, which Mrs Webber said they were ""horrified"" by.
""The CPS did not consult with us, as has been reported. Instead, we have been rushed, hastened and railroaded,"" she said.
Mr Coates's son, James Coates, said: ""The failures from the police, the CPS, the health service have resulted in the murder of my father and these two innocent students.
""The NHS mental health trusts have to be held accountable for their failures along with the police.""
Wayne Birkett - who suffered serious injuries including a fractured skull when he was hit by a van being driven by Calocane - has called for a public inquiry into the case.
He said felt ""let down by the system that is meant to protect them"".
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has backed calls for an inquiry.
Speaking to ITV's This Morning, he said: ""I am very worried by what appear to be a number of points at which action could have been taken that would have prevented this happening.
""The family are saying there needs to be an inquiry into that. I think they're right about that.""
On Thursday, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declined to commit to a public inquiry while speaking to reporters in Scarborough.
On Friday, a spokeswoman for Mr Sunak said: ""We believe that it's important that as the first action that the relevant agencies look back and ensure that all the proper processes were followed and that reasonable steps that could have been taken were taken to ensure that where there are lessons to be learned, we do so.
""That is the first thing that needs to happen.""
Ms O'Malley-Kumar's father, Dr Sanjoy Kumar, said the families would regroup to consider their next steps.
""We will look for answers regarding missed opportunities to intervene and prevent this horrendous crime,"" he said.

M7SABAEK08_V659UZC1K6P6R3G,Colorado pastor accused of multimillion dollar crypto scheme,By Brandon Drenon,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68072665,"A Colorado pastor and his wife have been charged with duping hundreds of local Christians in a multimillion dollar cryptocurrency scheme.
Prosecutors accuse pastor Eli Regalado and his wife, Kaitlyn, of fraudulently raising over $3m (Â£2.4m) by selling ""practically worthless"" crypto.
The Regalados pocketed at least $1.3m in the alleged scheme between June 2022 and April 2023, prosecutors say.
Mr Regalado said his plan was inspired by God, according to court filings.
The pastor said that ""God told him directly that investors would become wealthy"" by investing into INDXcoin, a cryptocurrency created, marketed, and sold by the Regalados, according to the complaint.
INDXcoin was offered to Denver-area Christians through the Kingdom Wealth Exchange, an online cryptocurrency exchange owned and operated by the Regalados.
The couple ""had no experience in cryptocurrency"", the complaint said, and a third-party auditor found INDXcoin to be ""unsafe, unsecure and riddled with technical problems"".
""Despite that report, the Regalados allegedly continued to promote the INDXcoin as a low-risk, high-profit investment,"" it said.
""In reality, the INDXcoin was illiquid and practically worthless"" and the couple used the funds for ""their lavish lifestyle"".
This included a Range Rover, luxury handbags, jewellery, boat rentals and snowmobile adventures, according to officials.
Colorado Securities Commissioner Tung Chan has filed civil fraud charges for violations of anti-fraud protections under the Colorado Securities Act.
She said her department was tipped off after multiple complaints by people who had invested in INDXcoin and had lost money.
Mr Relagado addressed the allegations in a video statement released on Friday.
""The reason that [Colorado] is saying that it's worthless is because there is no exit for people who have bought,"" he said, acknowledging that the cryptocurrency investors who have tried to withdraw funds have been unable to.
""We launched an exchange. The exchange technology failed. Things went down hill, and from that point forward, we've just been waiting on the Lord literally for a miracle.""
On the allegation that Mr Relagado and his wife received $1.3m, the pastor said that was true.
""But out of that $1.3m, half of it went to the IRS and $200,000 went to a home remodel that the Lord told us to do,"" he said.
Many viewers left words of encouragement in the comments on the video, including ""prayers going up"" and ""hang in there, stay strong"".
The BBC has reached out to the Regalados for comment.
In the criminal complaint, Colorado prosecutors have asked for preliminary and injunctive relief, damages for investors and for a constructive trust to be placed on the Relagados' property.
They are scheduled to appear in Denver District Court next week."
M8QPA6EDBR_UP5GPZJKO3CRMC4,Police search for motive in Illinois mass killing,By Jaroslav Lukiv,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68065165,"Police are still searching for a motive after a man suspected of killing eight people in Joliet, Illinois, took his own life after a cross-country manhunt.
Romeo Nance, 23, died after authorities tracked him down more than 1,000 miles (1,600km) away in Texas.
Nance is suspected of killing eight people at multiple locations in Joliet.
Seven of the victims were in two houses on the same street. Police say Nance also shot two other people, one fatally.
Joliet Police Chief Bill Evans said on Tuesday that Nance had an extensive criminal history and was related to most of the seven people found dead in the two houses, which are across the street from each other.
But he said that the other two shootings were random and that authorities are still searching for a motive in what he called a ""very complicated and active investigation"".
""We can't get inside his head,"" Mr Evans said at a news conference. ""We just don't have any clue as to why he did what he did.""
Mr Evans said that five women were found in the homes along with two men.
Some of those victims have been identified by officials. They are Christine Esters, 38, Tamaeka Nance, 47, William Esters, 35, Joshua Nance, 31, and Alexandria Nance, 20.
The names of two other victims, teenage girls aged 14 and 16, have not been released.
Authorities believe Nance killed those seven people before carrying out two other shootings elsewhere in Joliet, a city of about 150,000 people some 40 miles (64km) south-west of Chicago.
One of the attacks resulted in the death of a 28-year-old Toyosi Bakare, who was shot in the head as he left his apartment to buy cigarettes, authorities said.
Police said Mr Bakare was originally from Nigeria and had been living in the US for the past three years. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he later died.
The other victim was an unnamed 42-year-old man shot in the leg on Sunday, resulting in non-life threatening injuries.
Video of the incident shows the victim exchanging words with the driver of a red Toyota Camry, which pulls away and returns before gunshots are heard.
Police said they were able to trace the licence plate number on the Camry, which led them to Nance and the two houses with other victims.
That discovery sparked a manhunt for the suspect, who authorities warned ""should be regarded as armed and dangerous"".
But by that time, Nance had left the area and had fled south, police said.
He was located by US Marshals near Natalia, Texas, just outside San Antonio and about 18 hours from Joliet by road, at approximately 20:30 local time on Monday (02:30 GMT Tuesday).
Police said they do not believe he had any relatives or connections to Texas.
""I've been a policeman 29 years and this is probably the worst crime scene I've ever been associated with,"" Mr Evans said during an earlier news conference in Joliet."

The attorney general is considering whether judges should review the sentence of killer Valdo Calocane.
Calocane, 32, killed Barnaby Webber, Grace O'Malley-Kumar and Ian Coates in Nottingham last June.
The attorney general's office has received a referral arguing the sentence was too lenient, after he was found guilty of manslaughter and given an indefinite hospital order.
NHS England will also investigate his contact with mental health services.
During the sentencing at Nottingham Crown Court on Thursday, Mr Justice Turner said Calocane would ""very probably"" be detained in a high-security hospital for the rest of his life, after he admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
The families of those who died have expressed anger that Calocane was given a hospital order, with Mr Webber's mother saying ""true justice has not been served"".
She said the Crown Prosecution Service had, in November, presented her family with a ""fait accompli that the decision had been made to accept manslaughter charges"".
""At no point during the previous five and a half months were we given any indication that this could conclude in anything other than murder,"" she said.
Janine McKinney, from the CPS, said the manslaughter plea was accepted on the basis of ""overwhelming"" expert medical evidence, ""namely that his actions were substantially impaired by psychosis resulting from paranoid schizophrenia"".
It said that after three psychiatrists ""agreed that a partial defence to murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility"" was available to Calocane, it took the ""unusual step"" of commissioning a fourth psychiatric expert to review the evidence, who also agreed.
""On the basis of this evidence, the CPS concluded that there was no realistic prospect of conviction for murder, so accepted the pleas,"" it said.
In his sentencing remarks, Mr Justice Turner said one of the psychiatrists reviewing the evidence had said that Calocane's mental illness ""will never be 'cured'"".
Given that Calocane's schizophrenia was resistant to treatment Mr Justice Turner said it was ""very likely"" that he would never be released.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, former head of the Crown Prosecution Service, backed calls for an inquiry into any failings that led to the attacks.
He said he was ""very worried by what appear to be a number of points at which action could have been taken that would have prevented this happening"".
His comments came after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declined to back calls for a public inquiry, but promised to learn ""any lessons"" from the case.
Sir Robert Buckland, a former justice secretary, said better communication was needed with the victims' families, who said they were first made aware of a limited defence of diminished responsibility when a hearing took place in November.
Sir Robert said the prosecution had commissioned their own report before then, and described the lack of communication with the family as ""a matter of concern"".
""I think that everybody should be asking themselves whether or not the family should have been told earlier,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
After the sentencing, a spokesman for Attorney General Victoria Prentis confirmed her office had received a referral arguing the sentence administered had been unduly lenient.
Law officers now have 28 days to carry out a review and weigh up whether to refer the case to the Court of Appeal to decide whether the sentence was appropriate.
Under the Unduly Lenient Sentence Scheme, anyone can ask for a crown court sentence to be reviewed if they think it is too short.
During the trial, the court heard Calocane had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. The Independent Mental Health Homicide Review will examine what lessons can be learned.
Among the questions the investigation is likely to examine is whether the killings could have been predicted or prevented.
At Calocane's sentencing hearing, it was revealed the former University of Nottingham student believed MI6 was spying on him.
He had been detained under the Mental Health Act at a psychiatric unit in Nottingham four times since May 2020 - the final time he was discharged was in February 2022, more than a year before the killings.

The moment Valdo Calocane is sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court
He was prescribed anti-psychotic medication but stopped taking it, which the prosecution said led to a further decline in his mental health.
Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, which runs mental health services in the county, said in a statement it had ""robustly"" reviewed its interactions with Calocane.
Chief executive Ifti Majid said ""there are many people who live with severe mental illness issues who do not offend and are supported to live well in the community"".
""If a patient no longer engages with our services and support and they do not meet criteria to be detained under the Mental Health Act, they are discharged back to the care of their GP and can be referred back into our services at any time,"" he said.
Speaking outside the court Emma Webber, mother of Mr Webber, was critical of the Crown Prosecution Service's decision to downgrade the charge from murder.
She also accused Nottinghamshire Police's Assistant Chief Constable Rob Griffin of having ""blood on his hands"", following the force's failure to detain Calocane after an arrest warrant was issued in September 2022, over an assault on an officer. Nottinghamshire Police's Assistant Chief Constable Rob Griffin said police ""should have done more to arrest him"", but that he felt it unlikely Calocane would have received a prison sentence.
""Of course, an arrest might have triggered a route back into mental health services, but as we have seen from his previous encounters with those services, it seems unlikely that he would have engaged in this process,"" he said.

MGFRKZQ8PM_MIKRMWT30ZONF34,Officers disciplined as trawl of police records reveals misconduct,By Callum May,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68061370,"Background checks of all police officers and staff have found more than 400 links to previously undisclosed misconduct, including crime.
Nine new criminal investigations have begun following the checks and 88 officers will be formally disciplined.
Criminal allegations to emerge include theft, fraud, drugs and three sexual offences.
Police chiefs began checking records after the conviction, in January 2023, of PC David Carrick for 49 offences.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said at the time he wanted forces to ""root out anybody who shouldn't be serving"".
Weeks later, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley complained he did not have the power to sack ""hundreds of people who shouldn't be here"".
The records of 307,000 officers, staff and volunteers have now been checked against the six billion entries on the Police National Database (PND).
Overall, 267 officers and staff will be subject to ""management intervention"" - including one chief officer - or have their levels of vetting reviewed.
At a news conference before publication, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said they could not provide any more details about individual officers involved.
The PND was set up in 2011, to share intelligence between forces, following an inquiry into the 2003 killings of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, in Soham, Cambridgeshire.
Chief Constable Serena Kennedy, who led the NPCC review, said: ""Those people that we have identified who are now subject to criminal investigation, and also the 88 that are being subject to disciplinary investigation, absolutely should not be in policing. And I think it's really positive that we have to undertake this piece of work.
""It's certainly the largest piece of integrity screening that policing has undertaken. And it's about reassuring our communities that we are going to root these people out because they don't have a place in policing.
""Perhaps under the new lens, we might make new decisions or different decisions.""
Policing leaders are now talking to the Home Office about using an automated screening process in the future."
MNP4LQ2PPZ_OZ2HL2JY5BIFGJO,French police officer cleared of insulting sex crime victim,_,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68095693,"A French policeman who called a female sexual assault complainant a ""whore"" has been let off by a police court.
The incident happened in February 2022 when the woman filed her complaint at a Paris police station.
The officer later rang her and left a voicemail message about paperwork but his insults were accidentally recorded after he thought he had hung up.
The case sparked criticism about the way victims of sexual abuse are treated by police in France.
During the hearing, the court was to asked consider that the officer made the insults to himself or to his colleagues, and that they were not aimed directly at the woman.
It was requested that the officer be acquitted or be given an exemption due to his previous exemplary record.
A female judge ruled that the comments had not amounted to a sexist insult and acquitted the officer.
The woman's lawyer, Arie Alimi, told the AFP news agency that her client would appeal.
""The judiciary continues to protect police officers,"" she said.
The officer, who was suspended for four months and then transferred, apologised to the woman during the trail - saying he was ""really sorry"" she heard the ""unfortunate comments"".
He also said that he had to beg Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin to keep his job.
Mr Darmanin was among those to express outrage over the case, saying at the time it came to light that the officer no longer had a place in the police.
He told the Europe 1 radio station in February 2022 that the man had ""smeared all the women who try to file a complaint, when it is in our best interest to tell them to come to the police stations to do so"".
Mr Darmanin also said the officer had also ""dirtied and spat on the uniform of the Republic and his 250,000 other police and gendarme colleagues"".
The woman's original assault complaint is being investigated, French media group bfmtv reported.

MOVBZP80DS_K0GTIKJ0LBUPE4H,Mediators push for Gaza ceasefire deal but gaps remain between Israel and Hamas,By Yolande Knell,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68084402,"There is huge pressure for a new ceasefire and hostage release deal to alleviate the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza and the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas.
Up to now, weeks of mediation by Qatar and Egypt with US involvement have brought no breakthrough.
But in recent days, more reports have suggested ""serious"" progress is being made in indirect talks held with delegations from Israel and Hamas.
At the same time, on Wednesday, unnamed Israeli officials quoted by the Israeli media are cautioning that there is a ""very large"" gap on fundamental issues.
From what the BBC has learnt, the main block appears to boil down to major differences over how to bring a complete end to the war.
A senior Palestinian official, who is familiar with ongoing talks, told us that Cairo had laid out a new five-stage framework to Hamas officials.
This is said to start with a humanitarian truce, during which Hamas would release the remaining civilians it is holding hostage, including women, children and the elderly.
In exchange, some Palestinians would be freed from Israeli jails and the amount of desperately needed aid going into Gaza would increase.
Finally, there would be a long-term ceasefire and complete cessation of hostilities.
The handover of the remaining Israeli hostages would be accompanied by further Palestinian inmates being allowed out of prison, according to our source.
The indication is that the release of more high-profile Palestinian prisoners would be sought in exchange for the captive Israeli soldiers.
The Palestinian official said that Israel was insisting on keeping its forces on the ground until the last stage of the process.
We were told that Hamas has demanded that the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops and return of displaced residents to their homes takes place earlier.
Other international media reports have said that while Hamas is demanding a full ceasefire, Israeli negotiators are only prepared to accept a pause that would last weeks, but could be extended as conditions evolved.
At a news conference on Tuesday, Qatar's foreign ministry spokesperson, Majed al-Ansari said: ""We have presented ideas to both sides, we are getting a constant stream of replies, and that in its own right is a cause for optimism.""
Later, White House spokesperson John Kirby said that the US Middle East envoy Brett McGurk was in Cairo and would continue ""active"" discussions in the region on a new deal to bring home hostages and secure a humanitarian pause.
""The conversations are very sober and serious,"" Mr Kirby told journalists.
During a week-long ceasefire in late November, 105 Israeli and foreign hostages were freed out of more than 250 kidnapped in the shocking Hamas cross-border attacks of 7 October, which triggered the war in Gaza.
In return, some 240 Palestinian prisoners were released.
Israel and Hamas blamed each other for causing the collapse of the truce by rejecting the terms to extend the daily release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian detainees.
Now, on both sides, inevitably, there are major differences between what is publicly declared and what may be negotiable.
This week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeated that nothing short of ""absolute victory"" in Gaza can be accepted.
Meanwhile, many commentators have suggested that totally destroying Hamas - which has been governing the territory for a decade and a half - is not realistic.
However, one thing that Israel and its Western allies are unlikely to compromise on is that Hamas leaders must be removed from power in Gaza, to ensure that there can be no repeat of the attacks three months ago, which killed more than 1,300 people.
Interestingly, there have been unconfirmed media reports this week that as part of a ceasefire and hostage release proposal, Israel had made an offer to allow top Hamas leaders in Gaza to relocate to other countries. Hamas claimed it had rejected such a proposal.
With more than 25,000 people now killed in Gaza, according to local health officials, and a catastrophic humanitarian situation, international calls for a ceasefire have become much harder for Israel to ignore.
Meanwhile, noisy protests and rallies by the families of Israeli hostages ensure their demand to bring home their loved ones has become a priority of domestic politics. They have overwhelming public sympathy.
The latest Israeli reports denying that negotiations with Hamas over a potential hostage release deal are progressing will be a cause for general anxiety.
Unnamed diplomatic officials are being quoted by various Israeli media saying that suggestions of positive developments are ""fake"". They blame Hamas for a failure to compromise.
With mediators no doubt rushing to try to shore up the process, the most encouraging sign may be that neither Israel nor Hamas has yet indicated it is abandoning the latest rounds of indirect talks.

MQHBIW86LA_6ZVYLSL5WTC56VP,Ex-pat left life savings to two Scots libraries,Morven Mckinnon,26 January 2024,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c84nvq9j4y5o,"Letitia McKell with two of her nieces, Jan and Christina
An ex-pat left thousands of pounds to two Scottish libraries because they held happy memories of time spent with her husband, it has emerged.
Letitia McKell bequeathed more than Â£350,000 to libraries in Motherwell and East Kilbride when she died in 2001 - 56 years after emigrating to the US.
The cash funded part of a refurbishment of Motherwell Library and North Lanarkshire Council launched an appeal to trace relatives of the generous benefactor.
Three of her nieces came forward and on Thursday, they shared memories of their aunt at an official reopening of the library.
Library bosses hunt for family of benefactor
And BBC Scotland News spoke to an American friend of Mrs McKell - known as Leti - who explained why she remembered the libraries in her will.
The woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said the Scot had been devoted to her late husband, Frank,
""She used to say that she wanted to donate to the library because thatâs where her and Frank would sit on a bench for hours and read books,"" her friend said.
""That was her love, Frank was her love.
""She was always so excited to be able to go back [to Scotland].""
On the refurbishment of the library, she said: ""Leti would be jumping for joy just to see this.""
Leti's nieces, Winnie, Jan and Marlene, have fond memories of their aunt
Leti's gift to Motherwell library has funded a new creative craft area, known as the Letitia McKell Makerspace.
At it's grand opening, her nieces, Winnie McCall, Jan O'Neill and Marlene Frame agreed that their aunt was a very kind woman.
She emigrated to Canada in 1945 with her husband, before settling in Everett in the US state of Washington.
The couple had married in Glasgow in 1939 when she was 19 and he 27. They had been neighbours.
""She was a wonderful woman. Kind, thrifty,"" Jan, of Wishaw, said.
She believes they went to America looking for a better life, but they were ""down to earth people"".
Leti worked for a meat packing company, while Frank was employed at a papermill.

Jan remembers writing letters to her aunt who would reply telling her to ""work hard, do your homework"".
""She used to send packages, some of them were really funny,"" she added.
In the 1970s, the parcels were filled with items the youngsters could not get in Scotland - toys, ""googly eyes"" and ""funny green feet"".
Winnie, who lives in Livingstone, has fond memories of Leti's visits to Scotland, when she always wore the latest fashions.
""I was still quite a young child, but she always brought exciting things,"" she said.
She said her aunt would bring home ""exotic"" things such as a duvet and a continental quilt.
""She never forgot where she came from. I think that was very important to her,"" she said.
Winnie said she first visited the library with Leti's brother, Benny.
""We didnât have much materially but that was another escape, another way we could enrich our lives, so itâs wonderful this is all carried on in her name,"" she added.
""It will live on hopefully for generations and people will learn and grow as she did.""
Frank worked in Scott's Papermill and Leti worked at a meat packing company
Marlene and her mother spent three months in the US with Leti and Frank after Frank suffered a heart attack.
""I was only 11 at the time,"" she said. ""It was wonderful, Iâve got a lot of good memories about that.
""She was driving at the time, taking me here and there, going to visit friends and relatives. Just a different life from us entirely then.""
Marlene, of East Kilbride, believes they had a very comfortable life, but both of them worked hard.
""She was very kind and fun to be with. She was witty,"" she added.
The Letitia McKell MakerSpace was part of a wider refurbishment of Motherwell Library, which cost the council Â£1.6m.
The MakerSpace area has sewing machines, 3D printers and other activities and also features the Letitia McKell plaque

MS9Q7OETVU_KDQH1CO1Q9G8DFA,Cheltenham man leads police on 141 mile car chase across England,By Leigh Boobyer,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-68067700,"A man who told police his driving had been ""brilliant"" after leading them on a dangerous 141 mile (226km) car chase across England has been jailed.
Lauchlan Pritchard, 25, ignored police from Gloucestershire to Kent last year, because his partner was in labour and he wanted to get there in time.
Refusing to stop for officers, he also tried to ram a police car and drove the wrong way on a dual carriageway.
Pritchard, of Pennine Road in Cheltenham, was jailed for 12 months.
Sentenced at Gloucester Crown Court, Pritchard, who admitted dangerous driving and not having insurance or a valid licence, was also banned from driving for three years.
The chase happened on 20 November at about 21:00 GMT when Gloucestershire Constabulary were alerted to a Suzuki Vitara being around Cirencester with cloned number plates, the court was told.
The chase ended in Mereworth, Kent, when Kent Police deployed a stinger, deflating the Suzuki's tyres.
Pritchard then told officers who arrested him that he thought his driving had been ""brilliant"".
During the pursuit Pritchard drove through numerous red lights and ignored officers' blue lights requests.
The court heard that at one point he accelerated to 90mph on the M4 and swerved across all three lanes of the motorway trying to evade the police.
Steven Young, defending, said: ""None of the facts are in dispute. However, while it was a long pursuit there were large parts of the journey where he wasn't driving dangerously.
""For long periods there was no danger to other road users. He wasn't being blue-lighted for the whole distance.
""The reason he was driving to Kent was that his partner had gone into labour and that was where he was heading.
""Luckily for all concerned there was no collision, but admittedly there were numerous examples of dangerous driving during the long pursuit.""
Judge Rupert Lowe told Pritchard: ""Police first spotted you driving a vehicle with cloned number plates. But it seems throughout this period you don't care what the law says. You seemed to enjoy the police chase. You even claimed your driving was brilliant.
""You travelled at 90mph for long periods of time, during which you swerved across all three lanes of the M4. You tried to stop the police car overtaking you by swerving into it at high speed.
""You also tried to ram the police vehicle at West Malling before heading off on the Seven Mile Lane where Kent Police deployed a stinger and brought the pursuit to an end.""
Judge Lowe ordered that Pritchard take an extended test before obtaining his driving licence.

MSNLRVOW49_2G3CK6HEE2QBGTT,Darya Trepova: Russian woman jailed for 27 years for cafe bomb killing,By Robert Greenall,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68095875,"Russian woman Darya Trepova has been sentenced to 27 years in jail for the killing of pro-war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky last April.
Tatarsky was killed by a bomb in a statuette Trepova gave him, as he was about to give a talk in St Petersburg. Dozens were injured in the blast.
Trepova, 26, denied the charges, saying she thought the statuette contained a listening device.
She said she had acted on the orders of a Ukrainian contact, and was set up.
The sentence is one of the harshest imposed on a woman in Russia's history.
The attack on Tatarsky, 40, (real name Maxim Fomin) happened on 2 April, 2023.
Trepova was charged with ""a terrorist act carried out by an organised group causing intentional death"" and the ""illegal possession of explosive devices by an organised group"".
Russian investigators have accused Ukraine of being behind the attack, and Ukrainian officials have neither confirmed nor denied this.
But Trepova gave evidence in court that she was following orders from a man in Ukraine known as Gestalt (German for ""shape""). His identity is not known.
She said she made contact with him via Ukraine-based journalist Roman Popkov. She is opposed to Russia's war in Ukraine and had been seeking to go there to work as a journalist.
Trepova said that under Gestalt's instruction she gained Tatarsky's trust, introducing herself to him as an art student named Anastasia Kriulina and attending his talks.
In March Gestalt sent her the statuette, she said, assuring her that it contained a wiretap and a tracker. She said she expressed concern that it might contain a bomb.
""I feel great pain and shame that my gullibility and my naivety led to such catastrophic consequences. I didn't want to hurt anyone,"" Trepova told the court this week, quoted by Reuters.
""I feel especial pain and shame that a terrorist act was carried out by my own hands.""
Tatarsky was a well-known blogger with more than half a million followers, and had a criminal past.
Born in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, he said he joined Russian-backed separatists when they released him from jail, where he was serving time for armed robbery.
He was part of a pro-Kremlin military blogger community that has taken on a relatively high-profile role since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.
Tatarsky was among those who have gone so far as to criticise the Russian authorities, slamming the military and even President Vladimir Putin for setbacks on the battlefield.
But he was posthumously awarded the Order of Courage by Mr Putin.
Trepova's sentencing comes just after another controversial pro-war figure, the former commander of Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine Igor Girkin, was sentenced to four years in jail for ""calls to carry out extremist activities"".

MVCMFOKAYL_W8VI93GRQYETT0S,Downed plane: Still unanswered questions amid Ukraine and Russia claims,By Sarah Rainsford,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68089698,"This video can not be played
The BBC has verified this video showing the moment a Russian aircraft crashed in the Belgorod region
There are shooting wars and there are information wars and countries that are fighting do battle on both fronts.
For the rest of us, it can make establishing facts very difficult.
But whilst that's true in this war as in any, it's important to remember that Russia specifically has a long history of brazen lies and disinformation.
That was proven with the shooting down of MH17 and the Salisbury Novichok poisonings, to name just two major incidents in the past decade.
Even the full-scale invasion of Ukraine was launched on a lie: the false claim that a ""Nazi"" regime was putting Russian speakers here at risk of ""genocide"".
That doesn't mean every word from the Russian Defence Ministry and the Kremlin is untrue - or from MPs and the state media.
But they often are, so they need checking carefully before repeating.
This time, the reports that an Il-76 transport plane had crashed first appeared on Russian state news agencies.
They quoted the Defence Ministry in Moscow claiming that dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war had been on board the flight, on their way to a prisoner exchange.
Kyiv did not confirm that and from Russia there was no proof.
A Russian MP, Andrei Kartapolov, began expanding on the statement almost immediately, even suggesting Ukraine might have used a Patriot missile to hit the Ilyushin plane.
That would mean a Western-supplied weapon - a big claim, with as yet no evidence to support it.
As such talk grew louder and spread around the world, Ukraine still made no comment.
Russia's noise inevitably filled the silence.
In Kyiv, we started to hear rumours that a prisoner swap had been planned for today - then confirmation of that from a source. But no-one in Kyiv would say so officially.
Everyone we called for information told us, ""not yet"", or ""we're checking information"" or ""just wait"". For eight hours, there was nothing.
That didn't stop the speculation from Russia, including wild claims that Ukraine had killed its own soldiers on purpose. The supposed rationale for that is so twisted, it's not worth repeating.
But dismissing such talk doesn't mean dismissing the chance that Ukraine has made a terrible mistake. After all, we do know the plane came down - and Ukraine has the capacity for that.
Early on, the Ukrainska Pravda news website quoted an armed forces source saying it was ""their job"", and that the plane had been carrying Russian S300 missiles. A success, in other words.
That was later corrected, to say the source had not been corroborated.
Then this evening, we finally got two official statements.
They came from the General Staff and from Ukrainian Military Intelligence, and together amount to acknowledgement that Ukraine may have shot the plane down - though neither said so directly.
Ukraine stresses that it has no reliable information about who was on board. But it did confirm that a prisoner swap was planned for Wednesday and didn't happen.
It also said that Russia usually provides information on the route and transport that's to be used for a swap, to make sure it's safe.
This time, Ukraine says, there was none of that.
The General Staff statement amounted to a justification for firing on such a plane - without saying openly what it did.
Russia has increased its missile attacks from Belgorod lately, especially on Kharkiv where it has killed and injured dozens of civilians. Transport planes like that one that crashed on Wednesday morning deliver the weapons that are then launched across the border.
So this evening there are some answers, more hints and lots of claims. But there are still questions.
We can't be sure yet who or what was on the plane that came down. We don't know how much more officials here in Kyiv may already know and not be saying.
If there were Ukrainian soldiers on board the transport plane, then Russia will eventually have to provide the proof. And Ukraine will have to give fuller answers.
Because there will be thousands of families across this country tonight, who have soldier relatives in Russia as prisoners of war, who are now waiting - and worrying.

MWX851ORMU_CZVCYGMA75GWH85,Mothers join forces to warn of danger of social media trends,By Lewis Adams & Adam Bennett,4 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-68086204,"Parents who believe their children died as a result of dangerous social media trends have warned more will be hurt if online safety is not taken seriously.
Hollie Dance's son, Archie Battersbee, died aged 12 after a ""prank or experiment"" went wrong at their home in Southend-on-Sea in April 2022.
Lisa Kenevan's son Isaac, 13, died after it was believed he took part in a choke challenge on social media.
The mothers have since joined forces to warn others of potential tragedy.
They have been campaigning for schools to raise more awareness about the dangers of online trends and dares that their children could be viewing.
Their work has since been backed by Internet Matters, Southend West MP Anna Firth and Ms Kenevan's local MP Stephen Metcalfe, who represents South Basildon and East Thurrock.
""I think it is paramount we are involved in what our children are viewing but at the same time you have to respect their privacy,"" Ms Kenevan told BBC Essex.
""Once you look on one of those sites you get the algorithm and you get ploughed into it more and more.
""These videos seem to be all very, very innocent and all very childlike and that's the danger, they're just pursuing our children.""
Ms Kenevan said she was not aware Isaac was looking at anything ""sinister"" but said his ""highly inquisitive"" nature made him vulnerable.
Parents overloaded with paperwork from school should be asked to view a quick video warning of any dangers rather than a letter, Ms Dance suggested.
She called on schools to ensure the message was getting through and said the transition between primary and secondary school was a key point where parents were most receptive to safety information.
""Like Lisa, we don't want anyone to go through what we've gone through,"" Ms Dance said.
Ms Kenevan added: ""It's going to be a long road, that's the sad thing. It's highly likely that some parent is going to be experiencing what we've experienced, sadly.""
Mr Metcalfe said social media giants should do more to ""de-risk"" their platforms and remove ""seriously risky"" material.
In October, the government passed the Online Safety Act to control online speech and media deemed ""harmful"".
It said the act took a ""zero-tolerance approach"" to protecting children and ensured social media platforms were held responsible for the content they hosted.
Bosses of the platforms could face significant fines and possibly prison if they failed to take action to prevent and remove harmful material, the government said.

The ONS says it is more challenging to collect accurate data on these kinds of crimes.
But critics say the omission hides the extent of violence against women.
Not all incidents are reported to the police, so the ONS surveys 30,000 randomly selected people in England and Wales each year to work out how many crimes actually take place.
The results of the latest survey will be published on Thursday.
It says it has to treat some crimes differently.
The ONS's Helen Ross said: ""In face-to-face interviews, victims - most commonly women - can be unwilling to respond if their abuser is in the room or if their family is unaware of previous abuse.""
And it is hard to say what counts as a single crime of, say, stalking or harassment.
Because of these factors, separate analyses are published on sexual assault, domestic abuse, stalking and harassment.
However, these crimes, all of which happen more often to women than to men, are left out of the headline measure: the number of crimes that take place.
It only includes violent crimes, theft, robbery and criminal damage.
But this is the figure that has been used by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and former Home Secretary Suella Braverman, as well as in Conservative Party posts on X, formerly Twitter.

Violent crime statistics do not give a picture of trends in sexual assault because these crimes are classified as sexual offences and counted separately.
Scottish official statistics follow a similar approach for categorising crimes but often refer to their ""violent crimes"" as ""non-sexual violent crimes"".
The ONS has told the BBC it will add notes to charts in its reports on crime to highlight which offences are counted and which are left out.
Ms Ross also warned that any ""broad assessments"" on long-term crime trends based on a single metric ""should be made with caution"".
Sexual assaults are actually increasing, affecting just over 4% of women aged 16 to 59 in the year to March 2023, a figure that has nearly doubled since 2014.
The rise is mainly driven by an increase in unwanted sexual touching but rape, and attempted rape, are increasing too.
Stalking has also been on the rise since 2015, reported by just under 6% of women.
However, domestic abuse now affects 6.5% of women, as opposed to just over 11% in 2005.
Harriet Wistrich, of the Centre for Women's Justice, said relying on a definition of ""crime"" or ""violence"" that excludes what many women experience and worry about ""gives a distorted picture of how much safer 'the general public' are"".
""Women are 'the general public'. But their experience of violence is different from men's"".
Labour's Dame Diana Johnson, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee, said not being clear whether data about falling crime includes or excludes ""key forms of violence against women undermines efforts to combat it"".
She added: ""The government must make the scale of violence against women visible when they talk about crime in the UK.""
The Home Office was asked about its use of the crime survey headline measure.
In response, it highlighted its plans to tackle domestic abuse and violence against women and girls, and efforts the government is making to speed cases through the courts.
Labour says it would get experts to agree on a single measure summarising violence against women and girls and then commit to halving those crimes.

N3EKPT3F4N_VNKUJQ90GAHT72P,Homeowners face huge legal bills after SSB law firm collapses,By Abbie Jones,5 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-68076452,"Hundreds of clients of a stricken law firm are facing huge legal bills after their compensation claims collapsed despite being assured their cases were taken on a no-win, no-fee basis.
Many of those who have received demands for costs - some up to Â£40,000 - said they had no means of paying.
BBC North West has been told more than 1,400 people could be affected after SSB Law went into administration.
The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) said it was investigating.
Administrators FRP Advisory said the cases had been transferred to new solicitors who would ""advise on any adverse cost claims"".
Yusuf Patel, a civil engineer from Blackburn, said he felt ""broken"" after receiving a bill for Â£27,495 through the post before Christmas which he had ""no hope"" of paying.
The 54-year-old had cavity wall insulation installed in 2014 which he believed led to mould and damp in his terraced home.
He said in February 2020, someone ""knocked on his door"" and said they could help him pursue a compensation claim on a ""no-win, no-fee basis"".
He signed up and his case was taken on by SSB Law, who were based in Sheffield.
""They said I was not liable for any costs and if they lost the case they had insurance to cover all the fees. That's the reason I signed the documents,"" he said.
""It sounded like a good deal.""
But when his case was dismissed at court, he received a demand last year to pay the insulation firm's fees.
In December, a court issued an interim charging order on his home, meaning his creditors will receive a share of the proceeds when he sells it.
In some cases, courts can order a home to be sold if the debt is not paid back.
""I can't think, I can't sleep. My life has stopped at the moment,"" he said.
""It's scary to me because I've never ever been in this situation in my lifetime. I've never owed anyone a penny. I don't know how I can deal with it.""
Sean Wilkes, from Burnley, and Qurrah Ahmed, from Leigh, have parents who have received demands for thousands of pounds.
Mr Wilkes's mother, who is 77, has been told she needs to repay Â£18,000 in fees after her cavity wall insulation claim failed.
""My mum is on pension credit, she has no savings. I don't know what they think the chances are of getting this money from my mother and it's just causing an immense amount of distress,"" he said.
""I never thought that I'd see the day that my 77-year-old mother would have to be given the advice of 'don't answer the door' in case the bailiffs might come round. It's outrageous.
""Three days ago we had a call from a family friend who has just this week received a notice of enforcement for Â£13,500. She's a 73-year-old lady on her own and is very distressed by it.
""Right from the outset this was explained at every stage that it was no-win, no-fee. That there was no comeback was it not to be successful.""
Mrs Ahmed's 70-year-old father was told he owed Â£13,000.
""When we opened the letter, our hearts were just palpitating,"" she said.
""My dad, he wasn't functioning. He suffers from a number of health conditions including a heart condition and the impact this has had on him is absolutely devastating.
""The entire family couldn't eat, we couldn't sleep, we couldn't function. Every single day this matter was consuming us.""
Mrs Ahmed, 32, formed a support group after being contacted online by other householders who have received demands for money.
She said ""dozens and dozens"" had joined and that many of those affected are elderly or non-English speaking, making their situation ""much more difficult"".
BBC North West has seen emails to clients from SSB Law telling them the firm would take out an insurance policy to protect them ""from paying the defendant's fees"".
Solicitor Erich Kurtz from law firm Hugh James is now looking at many of the cases and said there could be more than 1,400 people who have received shock legal bills.
""The scale of this is incredibly large.
""The hotspots seem to be in the North West, North East and Wales.
""What we've seen to date is that a lot of those adverse costs are in excess of Â£20,000, Â£30,000, Â£40,000 per claim.
""The best advice we can give to people is to try to engage as soon as they can with insurers, try to reduce those costs and then seek legal advice.""
The Solicitors Regulation Authority said it was ""aware of the concerns of clients"" who have made no win, no fee, claims through SSB Law.
It added: ""We are investigating these concerns to find out what went wrong with these claims.
""We also understand a number of clients have already contacted both the Legal Ombudsman and Financial Services Ombudsman to complain about the standard of service they have received.""
The BBC has tried to put the allegations to the directors of SSB Law but it has not been possible to reach them.
Administrators FRP Advisory said in a statement: ""While SSB is no longer trading, we've secured the transition of all live case work to new providers and have notified clients"".
It said JMR Solicitors would look at ""any adverse cost claims"" by clients.
Insurance company QBE, which is taking action against Mr Patel to recover fees, told the BBC: ""Our role is to supportâ¯our customers, whether that's paying valid claims quickly or defending them from claims that have no merit.â¯
""Unfortunately, as is reported, some legal firms have been encouraging homeowners to bring unsubstantiated claims relating to cavity wall installation with the unrealistic promise of financial recompense.
""Encouraging individuals to take cases to court that have no merit can have serious consequences for those involved, a fact that is often not made clear to them at the outset.â¯
""We understand how upsetting this situation is for those who took these claims to court and we would encourage them to speak to the SRA about what their options are and to ensure the solicitors involved are held to account.""
Royal and Sun Alliance, which is trying to recover costs from the parents of Mr Wilkes and Mrs Ahmed, said: ""Over the past few years, SSB Law has represented individuals in claims against ourselves as the insurer of now insolvent cavity wall insulation businesses.
""Where a litigated claim has failed, this has resulted in the individual becoming liable to meet RSA's court awarded costs.""
It added it had ""paused recovery of unpaid costs"" when SSB Law ""failed to respond to their clients' concerns"" and was working to ""find a way forward for all concerned"".

N6AFCOFK1D_NYIS3UHUQ72I7KT,Hermit crabs are 'wearing' our plastic rubbish,By Victoria Gill,3 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-68071695,"Hermit crabs all over the world, which scavenge shells as armour for their bodies, are turning increasingly to plastic waste instead.
The conclusion is based on analysis of photos, taken by wildlife enthusiasts, and published online.
Scientists said they were ""heartbroken"" to see the extent to which the animals were living in our rubbish.
They said two-thirds of hermit crabs species were pictured in ""artificial shells"" - items that humans discarded.
The discovery is published in the journal Science of the Total Environment.
The study used social media and photo-sharing websites, as one of the researchers Marta Szulkin, an urban ecologist from the University of Warsaw, explained: ""We started to notice something completely out of the ordinary.
""Instead of being adorned with a beautiful snail shell, which is what we're used to seeing - they would have a red plastic bottle cap on their back or piece of light bulb.""
She and her colleagues, ZuzannaÂ Jagiello from the University of Warsaw and ÅukaszÂ Dylewski, from Poznan University of Life Sciences, found a total of 386 individuals using artificial shells - mainly plastic caps.
""According to our calculations, 10 out of the 16 species of land hermit crabs in the world use this type of shelter and it's been  observed in all tropical regions of the Earth,"" Prof Szulkin explained.
It isn't yet clear whether these materials are harmful - or perhaps even helpful - for the small, vulnerable crustaceans.
""When I first saw these pictures, I felt it was heart-breaking,"" Prof Szulkin told BBC Radio 4's Inside Science. ""At the same time, I think we really need to understand the fact that we are living in a different era and animals are making use of what is available to them.""
This internet-based ecological study, revealed that this use of artificial shells is a ""global phenomenon"".
""We saw it in two-thirds of all terrestrial hermit crab species,"" said Prof Szulkin. ""That's what we could identify just by using pictures taken by tourists.""
The researchers say the findings open up new questions about how these coastal crustaceans interact with and use plastic. As well as understanding whether it causes them any harm, the scientists want to work out how it might affect their evolution.
This whole group of crabs have adapted to scavenge and use discarded snail shells to protect their fragile bodies. And when those shells are in short supply, the crabs will fight over them.
What we don't know is how much the element of novelty might affect them - and whether the crabs will fight over artificial plastic shells,"" explained Prof Szulkin.
The researcher said that the natural snail shells were in decline, so she suspected it might be becoming easier for the animals to find an artificial alternative. And lighter, plastic 'shells' might even help smaller, weaker crabs to survive because they are easier to carry.
There is certainly a great deal of plastic in the marine environment for the animals to choose from. A recent study that attempted to quantify the scale of plastic pollution estimated that at least 171 trillion pieces of plastic are now floating in our oceans.
That could nearly triple by 2040 if no action is taken, experts have warned.
But there is hope that 2024 could see nations finally sign up to a long-awaited global treaty to end the scourge of plastic.
Mark Miodownik, who is professor of materials and society at University College London told the BBC that there was a lesson for humans in these images. ""Just like the hermit crabs,"" he said, ""we should be reusing plastics much more, instead of discarding it.""

NADSA6G5CS_YS27WJHZFTCF2DN,Child abuser has sentence doubled after West Yorkshire Police appeal,_,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-68064171,"A convicted sex offender has had his sentence almost doubled following an application to the Court of Appeal.
Michael King, 33, was sentenced to 10 years in jail at Leeds Crown Court in October after being convicted of eight sexual offences, including three counts of raping a girl under 13.
He was given a new sentence of 20 years after the application from West Yorkshire Police was heard on Friday.
The appeal was made under the Unduly Lenient Sentences scheme.
Det Insp Mark Tester said: ""King's offending has had a very traumatic impact on the victim.
""We hope the increased sentence he has now received will give her and her family a greater sense of justice as they continue to move on with their lives.""
A spokesperson for the force said it submitted the request as the family were ""disappointed"" with the length of the original sentence.
King was originally sentenced to 10 years for the rape offences, with a concurrent four-year term for four counts of sexual assault of a child under 13 and one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.
He was also given a one-year extended licence period.
That was quashed, with a new sentence of 20 years handed down, which included a one-year extended licence period.
He had already been placed on the sex offenders register and made the subject of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order for life.

NC9AUCE4BI_JK2AGP6OJRCJAWZ,Men admit conspiracy to remove genitals,By Emily Pennink,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-68093740,"Two men have admitted being part of an extreme body-modification plot involving pay-per-view website videos.
David Carruthers, 61, and Janus Atkin, 37, both from Newport in south Wales, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm.
The Old Bailey heard the conspiracy involved removing and cutting genitals, castration and inserting needles into genitals, between 2016 and 2022.
Judge Mark Lucraft KC adjourned sentencing to 4 and 5 March.
The wide-ranging conspiracy is alleged to have involved up to 29 offences of extreme body modifications on 13 victims and to have included the trade of body parts.
The court heard the procedures were filmed and uploaded to a website run by 46-year-old Marius Gustavson, from Haringey in north London, who previously admitted a string of charges, including ones related to body modifications to his own person. He will be sentenced separately in March.
During a separate trial of three other men who were convicted over similar incidents, prosecutor Caroline Carberry KC said Gustavson called himself ""the eunuch-maker"" and had been involved in numerous extreme body-modification procedures, including the removal of other men's genitals.
The Old Bailey previously heard how extreme body-modification procedures are linked to a subculture where men become ""nullos"" - short for genital nullification - by having their penis and testicles removed.
A third man, 61-year-old Stefan Scharf, of no fixed address, was not asked to enter a plea to the same charge and his case was adjourned for a week.

ND9B6PY05R_BYLFGZ3YFP4RFXW,NY police probe alleged attack on pro-Palestine march,By Nada Tawfik in New York & Nadine Yousif,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68075715,"Police in New York City are investigating a possible hate crime after pro-Palestine demonstrators at Columbia University reported being sprayed with a foul-smelling substance.
The incident happened on Friday at a pro-Palestine march on campus.
The students reported symptoms like vomiting and headaches, and some sought medical treatment.
Columbia University said the suspected perpetrators have been banned from campus while police investigate.
In an email to faculty and students on Monday, Columbia's Provost Dennis Mitchell denounced the attack and called it ""deeply troubling"".
""We condemn in the strongest possible terms any threats or acts of violence directed toward anyone in our community,"" he wrote.
""The University is committed to taking urgent action with the appropriate authorities in any such cases.""
The protest, which was unsanctioned by the university, took place at the front steps of Columbia's Low Library.
According to Columbia University's campus newspaper The Spectator, it was there that about a dozen or so students began smelling a foul odour, akin to sewage.
Some reported physical symptoms like nausea and burning eyes, as well as damage to their personal belongings.
The New York Police Department (NYPD) confirmed that it is investigating at least six reports related to the march.
In a statement to BBC, the NYPD said a 24-year-old female reported smelling an ""unknown odour and began to feel nauseated and experienced a burning sensation in her eyes"". Since then, the police said they received five additional reports.
The NYPD added that no arrests have been made and that the investigation is ongoing.
The incident follows months of tension on Columbia University's campus and others across the country between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel students since the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza war on 7 October.
In October, a 19-year-old former student of Columbia University was charged in an assault on an Israeli student who was putting up posters of hostages held by Hamas.
Pro-Palestinian students on campus have also reported being harassed online, as well as being publicly singled-out by a truck that featured their faces and names and that labelled them as antisemites.
In November, Columbia University suspended two pro-Palestinian groups - Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voices for Peace - in an effort to reduce tensions on campus.
The groups have pushed back, calling the suspensions unjust, and have continued to hold rallies under different banners.

NDH9E9VV6S_D7DWXMZA2X0BDFM,What do we know about the discovery of four bodies near Norwich?,By Laurence Cawley,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-68055418,"The discovery of the bodies of a man, a woman and two young girls has shocked those living in the town of Costessey, near Norwich. What do we know about the case so far?
At 07:15 GMT last Friday, police officers forced their way into a red-brick house in Allan Bedford Crescent after receiving a call from a concerned dog walker.
Inside, they found the bodies of Bartlomiej Kuczynski, 45, Kanticha Sukpengpanao, 36, 12-year-old Jasmin Kuczynska, and Natasha Kuczynska, aged nine.
Detectives are still trying to establish what exactly happened in the hours, days and weeks leading up to the deaths.
Mr Kuczynski and Ms Sukpengpanao both died of stab wounds.
Results from a post-mortem examination showed Ms Sukpengpanao, who was visiting the house at the time of the deaths, was killed by stab wounds to her neck.
Mr Kuczynski, who was living in the house with the two girls, died of a single stab wound to the neck.
Post-mortem examinations on Jasmin and Natasha will be carried out on Wednesday.
Detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.
Norfolk Constabulary has referred itself twice to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) in connection with the case.
Police were in touch with the family on 14 December after Mr Kuczynski was briefly reported missing. The force's handling of that case will now be re-examined.
At 06:00 Mr Kuczynski dialled 999 and said he was confused and worried about his own mental state.
He was advised to seek medical advice, the IOPC said.
Officers were not deployed to the house.
The BBC has asked the Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust whether it had opened a serious incident review into the case.
The trust said it was ""unable to comment on this case whilst there is an active police investigation"".
On Monday, Norfolk's Police and Crime Commissioner, Giles Orpen-Smellie, said he would be holding Norfolk's Chief Constable, Paul Sanford, to account ""robustly for the actions of his officers and staff"".
""I am clear that the residents of Norfolk must be able to depend on the effective working of the 999 system.""
The deaths have shocked people in the town.
Pupils have been offered support at the two local schools attended by the girls.
In a joint statement, Matthew Cross, the headteacher at Queen's Hill Primary School, and Dr Roger Harris, the headteacher at Taverham High School, said: ""Both our schools have worked closely alongside colleagues from Norfolk County Council's Critical Incident Support Team over the weekend to ensure we have extra support and provision in place, so we can meet the needs of both our pupils and staff at this difficult time.""
Dr Bianca Finger-Berry, the critical incident lead at Norfolk County Council, said: ""Normal routines with opportunities to access additional services can be really helpful.""
Floral tributes, and two unicorn toys, have been left a short distance from the house.
Addressing Jasmin, one of the tributes said: ""You were such a sweet, caring girl, yourself and your sister didn't deserve to have your lives taken away.""
Vincent Burch, who lives on Allan Bedford Crescent, said the youngest child who died went to the same primary school as his son.
He described being ""absolutely dismayed"" by the incident.
On Friday evening, the school sent parents an email informing them of the death of one of their pupils.
""I thought it was better to tell my seven-year-old boy about what happened,"" he said.
Once those found dead have been formally identified, files will be sent to the coroner who will open an inquest to establish the cause of each death.
While inquests might be opened in the coming days the full inquest hearings are likely to be months away.
In the meantime, the police will be seeking to establish exactly what happened in Allan Bedford Crescent.
The IOPC investigation into Norfolk Constabulary's handling of the matter is also likely to take months to complete.
It is not yet known what involvement other organisations might have had with the family. It is possible that other investigations by other agencies might also be held.
The next of kin of those who died are being supported by specialist officers.

NGYY03GFL3_9ZGCNROUVETN4G3,Woolworths could return to British High Streets,By Faarea Masud,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68068503,"Once loved for its pick 'n' mix sweets and bargain prices, Woolworths stores could return to the UK.
In 2009 when its British shops closed after the financial crisis, the brand in Germany, where it is known as Woolworth, was saved by HH Holding.
Current HH Holding chief Roman Heini says the UK is on his ""bucket list"" of destinations as he seeks to expand internationally.
It comes as Wilko, which filled the gap left by Woolworths, collapsed in 2023.
Mr Heini - who has worked in executive positions in both Aldi and Lidl and has been Woolworth chief executive since 2020 - told trade magazine Retail Week that despite the challenges of a cost-of-living crisis he had the opportunity to ""make Woolworth great again"".
Affectionately known as ""Woolies"", if the brand were to return to UK High Streets it is unclear how it would be spelt.
Woolworth Germany told the BBC: ""The brand name 'Woolworth' (without the 's') is owned by us throughout Europe. Should we ever plan to return to the UK, we would scrutinise the naming rights to minimise the risk of confusion. A transfer of rights could help if necessary.""
Woolworths originated in the US and operated for 100 years in the UK, having opened its first store in Liverpool in 1909. It had 807 British stores and its closure left more than 27,000 people unemployed.
It suffered from the economic downturn of 2008-09 and from cheaper competitors eating into its market share. Some analysts say it was also not able to keep up with online shopping.
Woolworth Germany said it was ""unable to confirm any plans for Woolworth to return to the UK market"" but that such a move was not ruled out in principle.
""Britain is on his [Roman Heini's] bucket list, although nothing is imminent,"" a spokesperson said, adding ""but it may be in the mix for the mid- or long-term future"".
Its offerings, however, have changed since it was last seen on the High Street. Previously, it was known for its variety of items including children's clothing brand Ladybird, CDs and confectionery.
Under Mr Heini's stewardship, Woolworth Germany has pivoted to clothing and homeware, which he says is at ""unbeatable prices"".
He told Retail Week that 6,000 of the 10,000 products that Woolworth sells are priced at â¬3 (Â£2.57) or below. ""To match that online, at least until today, is very difficult, if not impossible,"" he said.
But a re-entry would not be without its challenges. Disruption to supply chains because of attacks by Houthi rebels in one of the world's busiest trade routes in the Red Sea, plus post-pandemic ""turmoil"" were two of the issues Mr Heini cited as standing in the way of any immediate British revival of the brand.
However, as the collapse of Wilko left some people feeling nostalgic for Woolworths, the firm feels it would be welcome in the UK.
""I don't know of any brands where the recognition will be as high as it is in Britain, without having any stores,"" Mr Heini said.
Woolworth has more than 600 shops, with the majority in Germany but some in Austria and Poland.

NH41T4WT30_JS8HVAK663V9VA5,"Constance Marten trial: Baby kept in Lidl bag before being dumped, court told","By Helena Wilkinson, at the Old Bailey & Oliver Slow",3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68080832,"A baby whose body was found in a shed spent much of her life being carried in a Lidl ""bag for life"" while her parents lived ""off-grid"", a court has heard.
Constance Marten, 36, and Mark Gordon, 49, are on trial for the manslaughter of newborn Victoria, whose body was discovered in March 2023 after a weeks-long search for the family.
Prosecutors said the baby would still be alive if it were not for the ""reckless"" behaviour of the defendants.
The pair deny the charges.
Outlining the case against the defendants, prosecutor Tom Little KC told jurors the couple previously had four other children, all of whom had been taken into care after extensive involvement from social services.
He said the couple ""essentially went off-grid"" and lived outside to avoid social services removing their new baby, concealing the pregnancy from family and the health service.
The Old Bailey heard that only the defendants knew the precise date the baby was born, but the prosecution said she appeared to have been born after 28 December 2022.
On 5 January, a car the family had allegedly been travelling in was discovered on fire on a road in Greater Manchester. When it was searched a placenta wrapped in a towel was found inside.
The couple had left before police arrived and a high-risk missing persons inquiry was launched.
Two days later, Mr Little KC told jurors they dumped a buggy in London and ""the child was transferred and carried in a Lidl 'bag for life' where it would appear it spent much of its life before it died"".
Jurors were told the couple lived in a tent alongside their baby in ""freezing and obviously dangerous conditions"" - conditions which prosecutors allege ultimately led to her death.
Mr Little KC told jurors Ms Marten and Mr Gordon spent hundreds of pounds on taxi journeys while classed as missing people rather than putting it towards a ""roof over their heads and warmth and safety"".
He said that by the middle of February 2023 they had been ""living rough for over a month"", sometimes in ""freezing cold, windy and wet"" weather, and at one stage the couple were scavenging for food from bins.
The jury was told Ms Marten - who was not in court to hear the prosecution's opening - did not have a ""deprived upbringing"" and had ""potential access to the money and whatever help she needed"".
There was a sighting of Victoria as late as 19 February but the baby was not with Ms Marten and Mr Gordon when they were arrested on 27 February. When officers detained the couple, Ms Marten had what appeared to be stuffing from furniture inside her clothing, and Mr Gordon was still wearing a Christmas jumper.
On 1 March, prosecutors say baby Victoria's body was found in a shed in Brighton in the same Lidl bag she had been seen being carried in, covered in rubbish.
Pathologists have been unable to establish a cause of death.
In a police interview after the body was found, Ms Marten gave conflicting dates for Victoria's death, but said she had fallen asleep sitting up holding the baby in her jacket and awoke to find her dead.
She told officers she kept the body because she wanted an autopsy to be performed, adding: ""I've been carrying her around not knowing what to do.""
Ms Marten also told police she and Mr Gordon had planned to buy a flat but were recognised when they travelled to London to find one.
She continued: ""In order to save [the baby] from the services, then we would have to probably remove ourselves from society till we could find a house""
Mr Gordon told police their situation went ""really down really quickly"" after their car caught fire with possessions inside.
Ms Marten said in an interview they considered turning themselves in and insisted the baby had adequate clothing to survive outdoors, which the prosecution disputes.
Mr Little KC said the couple had put their relationship and ""view of life"" above the baby's safety, adding Victoria ""would still be alive... if it was not for the reckless, utterly selfish, callous, cruel, arrogant and ultimately grossly negligent conduct of these two defendants"".
Ms Marten and Mr Gordon are charged with manslaughter by gross negligence of their baby between 4 January 2023 and 27 February 2023.
The couple are also accused of four other offences : cruelty to their baby; concealment of the baby's birth; causing or allowing her death; and perverting the course of justice by concealing the body.
The trial continues."

Wayne Brown was discovered earlier on Wednesday, Greg Brackenridge, chair of West Midlands Fire and Rescue Authority, said.
In a statement, he said his death was not being treated as suspicious by police.
Mr Brown was being investigated over claims made on social media about his qualifications for the role.
""All our thoughts and love are with his family, his friends and his colleagues,"" Mr Brackenridge said.
""We ask everyone that his family and his colleagues are given time and space at this tragic time.""
West Midlands Police said officers attended an address in Birmingham ""where the body of a man in his 50s was sadly found"".
""A formal identification will take place in due course,"" a spokesperson added.
""The man's family is being supported by specialist officers and our thoughts are with them at this time.""
Andy Roe, from London Fire Brigade, where Mr Brown was previously based, said he was ""deeply sorry"" to hear about Mr Brown's death.
""Wayne was a valued and respected colleague in the Brigade for over 20 years before joining West Midlands FRS,"" he said.
Mr Brown spent 27 years in London Fire Brigade rising to the role of assistant commissioner.
He joined West Midlands Fire Service in November 2019 as deputy chief fire officer. He took up the role of chief fire officer in January 2023.
During his career, Mr Brown attended some of the country's most high-profile disasters including Grenfell Tower fire and the 2005 London terrorist attacks.
Ben Adams, Staffordshire's police, fire and crime commissioner, said news of the chief's death was ""the most tragic news"".
""Terrible loss of a good man,"" he wrote on X.
""Many in fire and rescue saw Wayne as a role model. He broke new ground and championed everything at his best in the service.""
Staff at West Midlands Fire Service have been offered support.
Earlier, the service confirmed Mr Brown was under investigation following claims made on social media.
The BBC understands the claims related to a business administration qualification which is a requirement of the role.
The service said a formal process was under way into the allegations.

NLODAEYNAE_VRYAOJSLAWOCB8V,Idris Elba warns against mandatory jail for carrying knife,By Oliver Slow & Callum May,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68085532,"Actor Idris Elba says there is no ""one size fits all"" answer to tackling knife crime, after victims' families urged mandatory jail terms for possession.
Dr Sinead O'Malley, whose daughter was killed in Nottingham last year, has called for compulsory prison sentences.
Elba said deterrents were crucial, but that some people carry knives out of fear.
It comes as the government announced plans to close ""a legal loophole"" to ban the sale of zombie knives.
Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Elba said many young people - usually young men - carry knives because they are scared, because they have been stabbed themselves, or have seen someone else stabbed.
""He's walking through a neighbourhood, and thinks I'm going to protect myself here - he ends up in jail for five years. You wonder, are we winning?"", The Wire and Luther actor asked.
Elba added that a deterrent to make young people know they will pay a penalty for carrying a knife is important - but argued there are ""gradients"" to the issue.
""As a deterrent it's a really important step to consider, but it's not one size fits all,"" he said.
Elba, a prominent campaigner on knife crime, said that in tackling the issue it was important for the experiences of young people not to be overlooked.
""We do not want to criminalise these people without offering them an opportunity to feel safe, to feel that their whole community is involved,"" he said.
In a highly emotional interview with the BBC on Wednesday, Dr O'Malley, a consultant anaesthetist, said carrying a knife was ""no different"" to carrying a gun.
She said: ""I believe there has to be mandatory prison sentences for carrying a knife.
""It is not just an offensive weapon or something you could eat your food with. It is a lethal weapon.""
In the same interview, her husband, Dr Sanjoy Kumar, a GP, described knife crime in England as an ""epidemic"" and said existing legislation on the issue appeared ""easy-going"".

Watch: In an emotional interview, Grace O'Malley-Kumar's family say they are ""dizzy with grief""
On Thursday, the government is planning to introduce a new law further clamping down on zombie-style knives by closing what it describes as a legal loophole.
Previous attempts to ban the weapons defined them as having a cutting edge and a serrated edge and ""images or words that suggest that it is to be used for the purpose of violence"".
But the new law will also ban zombie knives with no threatening words or images, the Home Office said.
This is the government's third attempt at banning the weapons since 2016.
A new definition was added in 2019 covering ""cyclone knives"", with two spiralled blades.
The new rules are being introduced to Parliament on Thursday, although they will not take effect until September.
Amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill will also:
The latest police-recorded crime figures for England and Wales show that offences involving knives or sharp instruments increased by 5% to 48,715 in the year ending September 2023 - but they remained 5% lower than the year ending March 2020, at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Home Secretary James Cleverly said the proposed new law would support the work the government has ""already done to make possession of zombie knives illegal and to close this loophole.""
Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Policing Minister Chris Philp said the new law would cover zombie-style knives and machetes that were not covered by the previous legislation.
""It would be illegal to import, to sell or to possess - even in private, like your house - the knives that are being banned today,"" he said.
Mr Philp added that, from April, police will also increase ""hotspot"" patrols in areas where they believe there is a high risk of knife crime.
He also said the government hopes to introduce technology in 2025 that will scan people for knives in public places.
Elba, 51, called this a ""step in the right direction, but said more needs to be done to ensure the weapons are removed from the streets.
""I think that there is some critical thinking that needs to be done about how we actually implement this ban,"" he said.
""I am still going to fight for youth services to be bolstered, a lot more thinking between the services - the police, the hospitals and the education services - having a real round-table coalition to figure out how we intervene,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Labour is focusing on a programme of action plans for young people caught with a knife, which could see them subject to curfews, tagging or behavioural contracts.
The Young Futures programme - first announced at the party's conference in the autumn - would spend Â£100m a year on new youth workers in accident-and-emergency departments and community mental-health hubs.
Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said Labour wanted to include knife crime as part of a ""sentencing review"".
""We're really concerned that there are too many young people who are not actually getting any intervention at all,"" she told BBC Breakfast, adding that ""empty warnings"" were not good enough.
""You've got to have urgent action to prevent re-offending, to prevent these offences getting worse, and these devastating serious crimes taking place.""
In the year ending March 2023, there were just over 19,000 cautions and convictions for possession of a knife or offensive weapon in England and Wales.
And in about 18% of cases, the offenders were aged 10-17.

NMRU5X6L3Z_YHU1YAN774GKID7,BT customers unknowingly charged for Xbox Game Pass,By Tom Gerken,3 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68085437,"Some BT customers are being signed up to, and charged for, Xbox Game Pass without their knowledge or consent.
An extra Â£10 per month was added to their internet bill, despite them not requesting the gaming subscription.
Customers have been complaining about the issue on BT's online forums for several months. Those the BBC spoke to had their money refunded but described their experiences as worrying.
BT apologised and advised customers to be on the lookout for similar problems.
""We're very sorry that the customers mentioned in this article have had Xbox Game Pass Ultimate added to their account without their knowledge,"" a spokesperson told the BBC.
""We recommend that all of our customers remain vigilant and if they notice changes to their account that are suspicious, to contact us as soon as possible to report this.""
""We will support and guide them on how to take steps to ensure their account is secure.""
The reason that the charges are being added is unclear - as is the extent of the problem.
But one person discovered the extra charge as recently as Tuesday, while the BBC has found examples of people complaining about the problem as far back as October 2023.
A BBC employee - who was affected by the issue - was told by a customer service adviser that it was ""a known issue"".
As well as finding out through checking their bills, some customers discovered the error after receiving an email which thanked them for activating their subscription - making it sound like they had done it themselves.
Another of those affected is Sue, from London, who contacted BT after noticing a discrepancy in her internet bill.
""I logged into my BT account online and saw that they charged me an extra Â£10 and that money had come out of my account,"" she told the BBC.
""Xbox Game Pass had been added to my accounts without my consent - I thought that's so odd, because I don't even have an Xbox.
""I actually thought I'd been hacked, so I phoned them up... and they explained that it was a BT error.""
Sue said that she was refunded the money, but was concerned about other people who were less vigilant.
Matt, from East Sussex, had similar concerns.
""I called BT after they failed to answer my post on X [formerly Twitter],"" he said.
""To be fair to them, they refunded the Â£10 and cancelled the subscription immediately. But it is worrying to hear that it is still happening.""
Meanwhile, Craig in Aberdeen said he found out about the charge when he received an email from BT, and contacted the firm via its webchat service.
""He basically said to me in the chat that this was an issue between BT and Microsoft, where this was being kind of randomly enabled and activated on people's accounts,"" he said.
""It says in the terms and conditions that there's no free period with this - you are immediately charged.
""My concern is this might not just be me, this might be lots of other people who perhaps don't really notice you get an email through.""

NT0N6QPBH0_581ZTICWCYUVOR3,Covid Inquiry: Chief medic told staff to delete WhatsApps every day,_,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-68054422,"This video can not be played
Prof Gregor Smith said he erased his own Whatsapp messages ""on a frequent basis"".
Scotland's chief medical officer told colleagues to delete WhatsApp messages ""every day"" during the pandemic, the UK Covid Inquiry had heard.
Prof Gregor Smith said he erased his own messages ""on a frequent basis"" in line with government policy.
He said any ""pertinent"" information about ""definitive"" decision making was recorded via email.
The Scottish government has said it is satisfied ""all steps are being taken to meet the inquiry's requests"".
Prof Smith was deputy chief medical officer at the beginning of the pandemic but took over as interim chief medical officer in April 2020 following the resignation of Catherine Calderwood after she broke Covid rules by visiting her holiday home. The appointment was made permanent in December 2020.
Ms Calderwood has been excused from giving evidence at this stage on medical grounds.
The inquiry was shown WhatsApp messages from July 2021 between Prof Smith by Prof Graham Ellis, an expert in geriatric medicine who worked as clinical adviser to the chief medical officer. Prof Ellis was appointed deputy chief medical officer the following month.
In a WhatsApp chat called ""CMO weekly"", Prof Ellis asked: ""Hope this isn't FOI able?""
Prof Smith replied: ""Delete at the end of every dayâ¦""
Prof Ellis replied with crying with laughter and thumbs up emojis.
Prof Smith told the inquiry it was his ""practice"" to capture any important information on the email system, to ensure it was an ""auditable trail"", as well as to ""exhort"" colleagues to do the same.
Asked if he deleted WhatsAppp messages every day, the chief medical officer said: ""If not at the end of every day then certainly on a frequent basis I deleted information which was no longer needed to be kept.""
He said information recorded on the official system related to ""definitive"" information once a consensus had been reached and would not be a ""verbatim account"" of a conversation but rather the ""essence of any decision"" that was recorded on the corporate system.
Prof Smith told the inquiry advice had been given to Scottish government officials to regularly delete informal messages, ""partly for security purposes"".
Earlier, the official in charge of enforcing freedom of information (FOI) laws in Scotland told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland that the principles of the freedom of information rules ""appear to have been subverted"" based on the messages that have been published by the inquiry.
Information Commissioner David Hamilton called the messages ""quite concerning"" and said he could launch a probe.
""Some of the material that came out last week, I think many people would say beggars belief,"" he said.
The commissioner described FOI rules - which give anyone the right to request access to information held by public bodies - as ""absolutely critical to democracy and accountability"" and to showing how the government makes decisions.
""And when I see the types of things that I've seen, then I've got to question is that being done and if I need to act I will act,"" Mr Hamilton said.
He stressed that his responsibilities would only relate to an appeal regarding any information that had been held or deleted.
Mr Hamilton said his investigatory powers were ""tightly limited"" but that his office was looking back through old appeals to see if any covered the period of time covered by the pandemic.
He added: ""What has surfaced through the inquiry, that's what's giving me concern that the public may not be getting the rights which they are entitled to.""
If the commissioner rules against the government, he can order it to reconsider an FOI request.
The Scottish government published mobile messaging guidance for officials and ministers in November 2021.
It said they were allowed to use WhatsApp and other messaging services to conduct business, with the guidance stating ""you must transcribe the salient points of any business discussions and/or decisions in a mobile messaging app into an email or text document"" before saving the information centrally.
The Scottish government's records management policy, published in February 2021, said records should be kept as long as necessary to fulfil the Scottish government's business and legal obligations. It defined a record as something ""which can provide evidence of activities, transactions and decisions made for, or on behalf of, the organisation"".
It said the purpose of these records ""is to provide reliable evidence of, and information about, 'who, what, when, and why' something happened"".
On Friday, counsel to the UK Covid Inquiry, Jamie Dawson KC, said former first minister Nicola Sturgeon appeared to ""have retained no messages whatsoever"".
The hearing in Edinburgh was also told that her then-deputy John Swinney's WhatsApp messaging was set to auto-delete.
On Sunday, Ms Sturgeon said copies of some of her messages had been retrieved and were handed to the inquiry last year.
The inquiry was also shown messages from a ""Covid outbreak group"" WhatsApp chat which included Prof Leitch and retired civil servant Ken Thomson.
In one post from May 2021, Mr Thomson wrote: ""I feel moved at this point to tell you that this chat is FOI-recoverable."" He included an emoji with a zipped mouth.
Two minutes later Prof Leitch responded: ""WhatsApp deletion is a pre-bed ritual.""
Mr Thomson denied there was a culture among Covid decision-makers of deleting messages to prevent them coming into the public domain.
A spokesperson for the Scottish government said it had accepted the recommendations of the information commissioner's most recent FOI performance report, and ""welcomed the progress it showed"".
They said ministers are ""committed to responding to both the UK and Scottish Covid-19 inquiries, as learning lessons from the pandemic is vital to prepare for the future"".
The spokesperson added: ""It would be inappropriate to comment on the detail of evidence being considered by the UK Covid Inquiry while hearings are ongoing.""
Scotland's information commissioner has said that he will take action if he suspects Scottish government officials have been deliberately withholding information to ""subvert"" freedom of information laws.
David Hamilton told BBC Scotland News that excerpts of conversations published between the national clinal director, Jason Leitch, and other officials gave him ""cause for concern that people were not abiding by the spirit, if not the law, of freedom of information"".
Messages published by the UK Covid Inquiry last week showed government officials discussing freedom of information laws in relation to WhatsApp chats. Prof Leitch responded by saying ""WhatsApp deletion is a pre-bed ritual"".
The Scottish government has said that it believes all legal obligations have been met. However, Mr Hamilton told BBC Scotland News that ""information may have been deleted that shouldn't have been deleted"".
He added that his office would take action if there was ""any suggestion that people have been deliberately trying to withhold that, to subvert that policy of freedom of information"".
Mr Hamilton said he had concerns about the ""attitude"" some officials had displayed towards freedom of information laws, and that he planned to consider if there was a ""systemic problem"".
The information commissioner said that some published conversations suggested a culture of ""actively instructing people to delete conversations"" as their content could be requested by the public.
He added that there was a lack of ""corporate oversight"" on informal messaging apps, and that blended personal and professional conversations were leading to problems.
Did Sturgeon follow guidelines by hitting delete?

NWD61PU8LA_L2YIGTCPXGN5CZN,"Crumbling schools plagued by leaks and cold, BBC finds",By Rahil Sheikh,7 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68021766,"This video can not be played
Watch: Freezing classrooms and leaking sewage - footage from schools across Britain
Schools in urgent need of repair have told Panorama they are struggling to keep children warm in buildings that are ""not fit for purpose"".
At one primary in Devon, temperatures are so low that children keep gloves and coats on during some lessons.
The head teacher says despite parts of the school being seemingly impossible to heat, he has been told it does not qualify for extra money for repairs.
The Department for Education (DfE) says pupil and staff safety is ""paramount"".
According to the government's own figures, the average primary in England needs Â£300,000 worth of maintenance or upgrades, while the average secondary school needs an estimated Â£1.5m.
BBC Panorama's investigation reveals what some of that damage and decay means for pupils and teachers who experience it every day. We found:
At St Peter's Church of England Primary School in Budleigh Salterton, Devon, some children work in unheated modular buildings - nicknamed ""the sheds"" - which were built in the 1960s and were supposed to be temporary.
Just last week, temperatures in the ""sheds"" dropped below 7C - even with all the heaters on. Workplace regulations say classrooms should be at least 16C.
""I'm really cold. I have to wear gloves and it's really hard to use a pencil or a pen when you've got your gloves on,"" said Sebastian, who is eight.
Hettie, 10, said: ""When it's so, so cold, you start shivering, so your writing goes really wobbly when you're actually writing it because our hands are shaking so much.""
Last year, a National Audit Office (NAO) report on school conditions said about 24,000 school buildings were ""beyond [their] original design life"" - that's more than a third of the entire school estate in England.
It also found about 700,000 children were having to learn in ""a school that the responsible body or DfE believes needs major rebuilding or refurbishment"".
Britain's Crumbling Schools

Watch on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)
The NAO's report also highlighted the scale of the Raac crisis across the school estate in England.
Last year, 276 schools in the UK had to partially close - because they'd been built with a dangerous crumbling concrete - known as Raac. Experts say that is only part of the problem.
The funding of school maintenance can be complicated. Different responsibilities are shared between central government, devolved administrations, local authorities and the schools themselves.
The Welsh and Scottish governments say they don't have figures for their backlogs of school maintenance. Northern Ireland says its bill has been growing for 15 years and is now estimated at about half a billion pounds.
The DfE says Â£5.3bn is needed each year to maintain schools in England, but it has only been allocated about Â£3bn by the Treasury.
With a Â£2bn shortfall, the backlog of repairs is growing fast.
In 2021 the government published results of a conditions survey of almost every school in England and graded them in four categories.
St Peter's in Budleigh Salterton was rated grade A, which means it had been assessed as in the best condition.
""It's farcical,"" said head teacher Steve Hitchcock. ""We have three classrooms that are just sheds, that are just not fit for purpose.""
A report from MPs on the Public Accounts Committee at the end of last year noted that schools in the north of England generally appeared to be in worse condition than those in the south.
At Russell Scott Primary School in Denton, Greater Manchester, head teacher Steve Marsland empties out buckets of water collected from leaks around the school whenever it rains.
In 2015, the school underwent a multi-million pound refurbishment to its 150-year-old building. But Carillion, the company contracted to carry out the repairs, left the school with a catalogue of new problems, including faulty fire doors.
Carillion has since gone bankrupt, with debts of more than Â£7bn, and the school has been left battling issues old and new, including flooding, roofs leaking and heating failures for nearly a decade.
""Since 2015, we've had to close the building six or seven times for various issues,"" said Mr Marsland.
""We've actually abandoned the building for explosive levels of sewer gas.""
Back in 2004, the Labour government's solution to repairing schools was billed as the biggest school-building investment programme since the Victorian era.
It was called Building Schools for the Future and aimed to rebuild or refurbish every secondary school in England over a 15-20 year period.
But this programme was cancelled in 2010, by the coalition government and then-education secretary Michael Gove. A separate programme for primary schools was also cut back, but not cancelled.
Sam Freedman was Mr Gove's adviser at the DfE in 2010. Speaking to Panorama, he said he now felt the decision to cut the Building Schools for the Future programme had been rushed.
He also said if the programme had not been cancelled he thinks most of the issues impacting the school estate today, including Raac, would have been ""picked up earlier"" - because every secondary school in England would already have been structurally assessed.
In a statement, a DfE spokesperson said the government had compiled the largest and most comprehensive survey of school building conditions in Europe - the first of its kind - to ""significantly"" improve the condition of the school estate, targeted where it was needed most.
The spokesperson added that Â£15bn of capital funding had been allocated since 2015 for essential maintenance and improvements, including Â£470m in 2023 ""to address school buildings in need of immediate support as quickly as possible"".
In addition, the School Rebuilding Programme, which began in 2021, commits the government to rebuilding 500 schools in England, both primary and secondary, over the next 10 years.
In Wales, the government says it spent Â£2.3bn over the past 10 years rebuilding and refurbishing schools.
Meanwhile, the Scottish government provided Â£1bn of funding to the Learning Estate Investment Programme (LEIP), which started in 2019.
However, in England, three years in, only four schools have been rebuilt and, according to the NAO, the government is already behind on its plans.
Emma Wilson, author of last year's NAO report, said the DfE ""has made much slower progress than initially expected with the school rebuilding programme. Both in terms of getting those schools on contract and ready for the build and also doing the construction itself, which will inevitably have impact on the rest of the schools that are following in the queue behind them.""
The DfE told Panorama that progress with the School Rebuilding Programme had been hampered by global events like the war in Ukraine.
In the meantime, St Peter's is left putting the funding it has into maintaining its cold and leaky sheds.
And at Russell Scott Primary, Mr Marsland is still laying out plastic containers when it rains.
In 2022, he received a letter from the Secretary of State for Education, saying that the school would be rebuilt, but he has been waiting since then for news of when the work will start.
When Panorama contacted the DfE, it said the school will have ""a detailed programme plan to review"" by the end of January 2024 and will be more ""deeply engaged"" by the department from that point onwards.
""You get used to every problem and you deal with it, and deal with it, and deal with it. So it becomes second nature and just normalised, which is the issue,"" Mr Marsland said.
""I should have been retired, I'm 65 now.  But I can't leave the school in this way until it's rebuilt. Until I see a digger on the foundations being being laid for a new schoolâ¦ I'll be going nowhere.""

It's a popular Christian festival that in modern times has become linked to the giving and eating of chocolate eggs in the UK.
However, with January still chugging along, the end of March might feel pretty far away.
And there are some big events happening before then, including Valentine's Day, Lunar New Year and Mother's Day.

Unusual Easter eggs: Giant ones, weird ones and cheesy ones
Despite Easter being a fairly long way off, it hasn't stopped supermarkets and shops stocking their shelves with thousands of Easter eggs.
So with more than three months still to go before Easter, why exactly is this happening?
""This is a tactic used by the supermarkets to encourage shoppers to spend.
""If shoppers spot an Easter egg on the shelf in January, they might feel pressured to buy it just in case it sells out or the price goes up before Easter.
""The supermarkets are trying to create a sense of urgency,"" retail expert Natalie Berg told Newsround.
""The supermarkets are also hoping that you may be tempted to eat the chocolate before Easter, in which case you'll have to go back to the store and buy more.""
The question many people are likely to ask is whether this tactic actually pays off for shops.
""Yes it works, especially when you consider how long they've have been doing this,"" Natalie says.
Some supermarkets say they put Easter eggs out on their shelves early because there's demand for them, even at this time of year.
A Tesco spokesperson told Newsround: ""It's a few weeks until customers are able to choose from our full range of Easter products. However, we know some of our customers like to buy their eggs early so we have started selling a small selection in some of our stores.""
It's something Sainsbury's also spoke to Newsround about. Their spokesperson said: ""Some stores may have a couple of Easter products on display. This is because some customers like to treat themselves early and begin their preparations in plenty of time.""

O11Q33XSGR_5V0NXJ0FDOUDH5L,France set to tighten immigration law after court scraps some measures,By Paul Kirby,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68103950,"The French government says it will push through a controversial immigration law ""in the coming hours"", despite many of the measures being struck out as invalid.
Most of the 35 measures rejected by France's nine-member Constitutional Council were added to the bill because of right-wing and far-right pressure.
But the new law still represents a hardening of the immigration rules.
Foreigners legally in France could now be deported with criminal convictions.
Even those who came to France before they were 13 or those who have lived in France for more than 20 years could be expelled if they are given substantial jail terms and deemed to be a ""grave threat to public order"".
Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said the Constitutional Council had validated all the government's measures and it was now time to put the law into practice.
""The Republic will never have had a law as tough as this,"" he told France's TF1 TV channel on Thursday night.
Details on enforcing the law would be handed out on Friday, he said, and as of February or March every French prefect would have to put together their files to decide which offenders should be expelled.
However, the law also includes measures that prevent authorities from placing under-18s in detention centres and gives prefects the power to hand one-year residence permits to people with no papers who work in jobs such as construction, which are known to be facing labour shortages.
Friday's ruling coincided with latest migration figures from France's interior ministry showing the number of foreign offenders expelled from France in 2023 had risen by 10.7% in 2023 to more than 17,000, although well down on the numbers before the Covid crisis.
Asylum applications increased by 8.6% last year to almost 142,500, but at a slower rate than the year before.
With European Parliament elections ahead in June, and without a majority in the National Assembly, President Emmanuel Macron is facing a strong challenge from the far right and he is reliant on parties outside the government to get legislation through.
It was only five weeks ago that the government managed to push through its immigration law, with the backing of right-wing Republicans and the far-right National Rally (RN).
Left-wing parties accused the president's centrist Renaissance party of enabling the far right and betraying their own convictions, while some Renaissance MPs refused to back the proposals.
In order to get the bill through, the government accepted a series of amendments on top of the measures already proposed, such as limiting family reunifications and reducing access to welfare.
It was largely those amendments that were thrown out by the nine ""sages"" who make up France's top constitutional authority on Thursday evening, to the anger of the Republicans and the RN.
Government figures hailed the Constitutional Council's ruling as a victory, as the original measures that ministers had initially failed to get past MPs were intact. ""We have all the resources we need,"" Mr Darmanin said.
The president of the RN, Jordan Bardella, complained of a ""coup by the judges, with the backing of the president of the Republic himself"", while Republicans leader Eric Ciotti said it appeared that constitutional reform was more vital than ever ""to safeguard France's destiny"".
Commentators pointed out that the sages had scrapped the added measures because they were seen as not sufficiently linked to the initial legislation, not because of their substance.
The French right is now pressing for a second immigration bill to be put forward, although the interior minister has made clear he has no intention of doing so.

O4SWJ1HTBM_YIYKV8K4LL6Q03G,Disabled boy from Wem returns to school in transport row u-turn,By Joanne Writtle,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-68071238,"A teenager with severe disabilities will be returning to school following a council u-turn in a row over transport funding.
Rowan, 16, from Wem has missed nearly half of the school year after his family discovered Shropshire Council planned to cut his allowance by 30%.
The council insisted its contribution would have still covered the cost.
After a five-month dispute with the teenager's parents, the local authority has reinstated the Â£4,702 a year rate.
The teenager, who has not been to school since the end of term in July 2023, suffers from profound and multiple learning disabilities (PMLD).
His life-limiting condition means he is unable to move, walk or swallow without help and is fed through a tube.
Until the age of 16, his parents juggled the task of driving him to and from school with a carer in tow and were provided with an allowance to cover the costs.
However, at the end of last summer, they were told this fee would drop to Â£3,344.
On Wednesday, the family were contacted by the local authority and informed of the its decision to keep paying the allowance they had previously received.
While the u-turn has been described as ""great news"" by Rowan's father Paul, the family say they are ""disappointed"" no other transport solution such as a taxi has been offered.
In a bid to help cover the costs, Paul, 55, plans to move nearly 150 miles away for a better paid job to support the family.
His mother Sharon, 54, will make four journeys a day, totalling 44 miles, to take Rowan to and from school in Shrewsbury.
She said: ""The most sad part of it is the unfairness towards Rowan because he has to go to this particular school, there's nowhere else he can go.""
Rowan needs an oxygen machine at night, which means energy bills are high, but his parents say their fight is not just about money.
Paul added: ""It breaks my heart as a parent. We try our best and we've fought every day for nearly 17 years looking after this child who's solely dependent on us.""
David Shaw, assistant director of education and achievement at Shropshire Council, said bosses had been working extensively with Rowan's family to help resolve their concerns.
Mr Shaw said the council had put in place a financial solution that fully covered the cost of the return transport so the family didn't have to spend any money.
""We take each case on an individual case by case basis, including additional consideration where children and young people have particularly complex needs,"" he said.
Mr Shaw added the council wanted to ensure special educational needs (SEND) school transport supported pupils with the greatest needs but faced increased budget pressures.
""We are currently undertaking engagement activities with our local SEND communities to work with us to develop ideas and possible solutions,"" he said.
Shropshire Council is consulting on plans to cut transport help for most special needs children over 16 and those in nursery - other than in exceptional circumstances. This year Shropshire Council is making savings of around Â£50m.
North Shropshire MP Helen Morgan said: ""I think it's very important to acknowledge that there's a huge funding crisis in councils, but these are some of the most vulnerable people in our society.""

OCQK69TPE6_QFY6JAT63TY0L65,Staffordshire dish lobby celebrated in Stoke-on-Trent,By Richard Price,6 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-68047258,"Traders are starting a week-long celebration of a Staffordshire delicacy to encourage more people to try it.
Lobby is a meat and vegetable stew made with leftovers, initially created by potters in the area who were unable to afford fresh food every day.
National Lobby Week is an initiative by Longton Exchange shopping centre to help support local businesses.
The centre said it had chosen January as people's budgets were often at their tightest.
""If I was speaking to a Martian about a lobby, I'd say it was the best of what you've got left in the cupboard veg-wise, plus pieces of meat, slow cooked for six to eight hours,"" said Jake Sutton, who runs cafe No.22 in Hanley Market.
""What you've got left, you've worked hard for it, so you don't want to chuck it in the bin.
""You need to repurpose it, and how better than to do it than make a big stew at everyone can dip in to.""
He said he had been brought up on the hearty dish and it was ""massively popular"" in his cafe in winter.
Chris Ward, manager of the Longton Exchange, said the timing for the week-long celebration was partly inspired by the cost of living crisis.
""This week is the week before pay day for a lot of people, the tightest week of the year really after Christmas, and we thought it was a cheap meal that was easy to make.""
The shopping centre will be offering free helpings of lobby between 13:00-14:00 GMT daily, between 22-27 January.
It is hoped the event will take off in a similar way to Oatcake Day which takes place annually on 8 August.

OF4ZGUUHUO_0VASXDVPTVSFG1N,Labour vows to tackle 'NHS waste' if it wins next election,By Paul Seddon,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68070255,"Labour has vowed to tackle NHS ""waste"" if it wins the next election, saying inefficiencies are costing the health service billions of pounds.
In a speech, shadow health minister Karin Smyth said taxpayers were ""paying more and getting less"" due to lack of reforms under the Conservatives.
She said savings could be made by improving communication with patients and cutting management consultants.
Staff shortages had also fed a reliance on recruitment agencies, she added.
More effective use of resources, Ms Smyth argued, was also supported by NHS workers who were frustrated by old kit and ""unnecessary box-ticking exercises"".
Labour has made improving NHS services a central part of its offer to voters ahead of the general election expected to take place later this year.
But with the party also signed up to strict tax and spending rules to burnish its economic credibility, it has not committed itself to big spending increases on health.
Instead, it insists performance can be improved through tackling ill health sooner, more locally-delivered services, and better use of new technologies.
To the unease of some on the left of the party, it has also set out plans to increase use of the private sector to tackle backlogs.
Ms Smyth set out Labour's pitch at the annual conference of the Institute for Government think tank in London, standing in for shadow health secretary Wes Streeting, who missed the event because of illness.
In her speech, she said the government must ""do better with the money the public gives to the NHS"".
She added that both staff and patients were aware of ""waste in the system"", but that Conservative ministers had shown a ""lack of bravery in taking on necessary reforms"".
""This is a cultural problem, set from the top,"" she added. ""Across the service, it adds up to an enormous waste of money we don't have.""
Ms Smyth also said that, if it took office, Labour would look to pay high street opticians to carry out some routine NHS eyecare, such as for cataracts and glaucoma, in an effort to reduce backlogs.
The party says this would come through negotiating an England-wide ""national deal"" with opticians.
It has not put a cost on the proposal, but argues it can be delivered through existing budgets by reducing the time spent by higher-paid NHS specialists on routine care.
Among the examples she cited were appointments missed because letters arrived late in the post, and hospitals repeating tests that had already done by GPs.
The party is also highlighting the continued use of pagers by NHS staff, as well as spending on paper and postage, as examples where efficiency could be improved.
Labour calculates that hundreds of millions of pounds could be saved by routinely texting patients appointment reminders. It also wants to notify all NHS app users when they become eligible for vaccinations and screenings.
It also says its policy of training more staff, paid for by ending non-domiciled tax status, would bring long-term savings by cutting the NHS's growing reliance on agency staff.
Challenged after her speech on how Labour's efficiency drive would be different to those that have come before, Ms Smyth said the ""real difference"" would be a focus on what patients wanted instead of ""better supply chains"".
However, Health Secretary Victoria Atkins said the Conservatives had delivered ""record funding for the NHS"", and had laid out a long-term plan to train and keep more NHS staff.
""By sticking to the plan that Rishi Sunak has set out we will strengthen the economy, that's how you pay for a strong NHS,"" she said.
""Labour can't say how they would pay for their policies because they don't have a plan,"" she added.

OFYQR5PTID_XEUU4776X40G3UO,Czech Republic MPs vote to tighten gun laws,By Rob Cameron,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68110357,"MPs in the Czech Republic have approved an amendment tightening gun legislation, a month after the worst mass shooting in the country's history.
The amendment - which was proposed before the killings - must still pass through the senate and be signed by the president, and will not come into force until 2026.
It's far from revolutionary. So would it even have made a difference?
When a 24-year-old graduate student with a history of depression shot dead 14 people at Charles University in December, he did so as a licenced gun user with eight legally-owned weapons.
Police believe his victims - students and staff - were killed with a pistol, but the shooter was also carrying an AR-10 semi-automatic assault rifle.
That gun became a symbol of the attack when he was captured on video with it, roaming the balustrade of the Arts Faculty and taking potshots at passers-by, injuring several.
Moments later he threw the rifle down to the cobbled pavement and turned yet another weapon - a shotgun - on himself.
It later transpired he had acquired seven of the weapons in quick succession in the spring of 2023. No-one questioned the purchases; he had no criminal record and he held a valid gun licence.
No alarm bells were rung, nor could they be. There is no central control mechanism to warn the police that someone is amassing an arsenal.
The gun licence had also been acquired relatively recently - and easily.
The application has to be signed by a doctor, but they are unlikely to have known about the man's reported history of psychiatric problems. These would have been treated by a psychiatrist with no legal obligation to inform the doctor of them.
The legal amendment - proposed long before the shooting - could close some of these loopholes. It envisages a revamped online register of both guns and their owners. Doctors - including psychiatrists - should have access to it.
Gun shops will be legally required to report purchases they deem suspicious. The system should also flag people acquiring numerous weapons.
Police will also be able to seize weapons as a precaution, for example if their owners make threats on social media. Remarkably it is not currently in their power to do so.
But there will still be no mandatory psychological tests to obtain a gun licence, as is common in other countries. Czech doctors can - but do not have to - request them before signing the form.
There may be further amendments toughening up the legislation on its journey through parliament. But they are almost certain to leave untouched the fundamental right to carry a weapon in the first place - an odd obsession in one of the safest countries in Europe.
In 2021, the Czech Constitution was amended to include the right to bear arms in self-defence after a massive petition campaign that was prompted by EU moves to limit the possession of weapons, including legal ones.
There are now more than 300,000 licenced gun owners - and more than a million guns - in the Czech Republic, a country of 10.7 million people.
The Czechs are a nation of deer and wild boar hunters - not to mention biathlon fans. But the vast majority of licences are granted for personal protection, not for hunting or competitive shooting.
Why they need them for the streets of Prague and Brno is unclear.

OITPP5KH9T_KB9OO9RYN2BNZ30,Why private helicopters are still in demand,By Michael Dempsey,3 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67635051,"How many children draw helicopters and aeroplanes dreaming of being pilots or designing their own aircraft one day?
Jason Hill was one such teenager, but he clung on to that vision through aeronautical engineering studies and work in the aviation industry.
His dream was revealed to the world on 7 December when the wraps came off a new helicopter designed by him.
""I felt an overwhelming sense of pride and jubilation,"" Mr Hill says about the grand unveiling. But creating a new helicopter has been a daunting process.
""The sheer volume of difficult things that need to be executed and coordinated makes the task seemingly impossible,"" says Mr Hill.
The five-seater Hill helicopter will be powered by a turbine engine, a small and light jet motor that drives the rotor blades. To keep the weight down the fuselage is made from carbon fibre.
However, with the UK in a cost of living crisis, it seems like a challenging time to launch a luxury product. The Hill machine has a price tag of almost Â£600,000 - cheap for a helicopter, but for most people completely unaffordable.
Nevertheless, there are buyers. Hill has chalked up 1,222 orders worth Â£540m. Those buyers have parted with non-refundable deposits of up to Â£100,000.
And that's all happened before the helicopter's first flight, projected for the middle of this year.
Of course, it's not just Hill that's able to sell luxury transport options.
California's Robinson has popularised helicopter flying with a family of small, two to five seat aircraft that have notched up nearly 14,000 sales for the manufacturer.
Robinson's R66 Turbine costs just over $1m (Â£790,000) and it sees orders increasing, growing from 101 helicopters in 2022, to a projected 120 units for 2023, and 150 in 2024.
The British Helicopter Association's chief executive Tim Fauchon doesn't dispute that helicopter ownership is for the wealthy. ""If you're flying a helicopter you've got a bit of cash behind you.""
However it still makes sense to shell out for such a machine when time is of the essence. ""You buy a helicopter to save time, it's an efficient way of getting from A to B.""
And private helicopter owners can recoup their costs by leasing their machine out to flying schools when they're not using it.
Also, appearing on the horizon, are fresh competitors for the helicopter business.
Electric Vertical Take Off and Landing aircraft (Evtol) have been promoted as the answer to a host of regional and urban transport needs with several hundred projects on the go worldwide.
Powered by batteries and often having multiple rotors, Evtol makers say the aircraft will be cheaper, quieter and easier to maintain than helicopters.
The promise is that one day, such aircraft could bring the convenience of helicopter travel to a much bigger market.
Adam Twidell is working out how to integrate Evtol machines into the operations of private jet club Flexjet, which has ordered an Evtol from Brazil's aerospace giant Embraer.
Its Eve Evtol machine will, Flexjet hopes, pick up passengers from private terminals and whizz them into city centres.
More technology of business
The challenge for any new flying machine such as Eve or the HX50 is to win regulatory approval says Mr Twidell. He has no illusions over the extent of testing a new aircraft faces.
""In aviation seeing is not believing. Certification means every single part of the machine has to be certified for safety.""
Can Hill emulate the success of Robinson or beat off the Evtol challenge? Mr Hill's vision involves dispensing with external suppliers and designing and building all components in-house, including the power plant.
The company says 95% of each machine will be constructed in-house, which will result in huge savings, according to Hill.
However industry veterans describe such an approach, as opposed to sourcing parts from established external production lines, as a big challenge.
Hill hopes that it can cut one of the costs of owning a helicopter - the compulsory rebuild that comes after a certain number of hours have been flown.
For a Robinson helicopter with a turbine engine this comes at 2,000 hours and costs $400,000. Hill hopes to stretch that figure to 5,000 hours and replace the engine and gear boxes for $150,000.
Spencer Phillips is head of training at Advance Helicopters, a flying school on England's South Coast.
Advance uses a mix of Robinson helicopters, which he praises as ""a great training aircraft"", but is impressed with the specifications of the Hill helicopter.
He mentions one feature in particular. The Hill aircraft features a fully automated start-up procedure for the tricky task of monitoring temperatures before fuel can be safely pumped into the turning motor.
He explains how this will take a challenging task out of the hands of the private pilot: ""It's far too easy to mess this up with a turbine and melt the engine!"".
He accounts for the rush to pay deposits at Hill by the closed nature of the rotary wing world. ""It's word of mouth in the helicopter community, most of us know each other. Once people started putting deposits down it snowballed."""
OJIQ4EVQ9D_9X12RW1086GD88N,ICJ says Israel must prevent genocide in Gaza,By Raffi Berg and Anna Holligan,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68108260,"This video can not be played
Watch: ICJ orders Israel to prevent genocidal acts
The UN's top court has ordered Israel to take all measures to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza, but stopped short of telling it to halt the war.
The highly anticipated hearing was part of a controversial case brought by South Africa.
South Africa had asked the court to order Israel to stop military action straight away pending a decision on whether Israel has committed genocide.
Israel has vehemently rejected the accusation as ""wholly unfounded"".
Friday's hearing at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague was the first time the judges have issued a ruling as part of the case which began two weeks ago. A verdict on the central allegation of genocide is expected to take much longer, possibly years.
Although the court did not call for a halt to Israel's military action, as South Africa had asked it to do, it is being interpreted as a victory for those who support South Africa's case.
The ICJ found it did have jurisdiction on the matter, and decided there was a plausible case under the 1948 Genocide Convention, and that the Palestinian population in Gaza was at real risk of irreparable damage.
""For the implementation of the international rule of law, the [ICJ's] decision is a momentous one,"" said South Africa in a statement. It called Friday's ruling a ""significant milestone in the search for justice for the Palestinian people"".
The Palestinian foreign minister said the ruling showed that ""no state is above the law"", adding it ""should serve as a wake-up call for Israel and actors who enabled its entrenched impunity"".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not address the ruling directly but said ""Israel's commitment to international law is unwavering. Equally unwavering is our sacred commitment to defend our country.""
He said South Africa's allegation that Israel was committing genocide was ""not only false, it's outrageous, and decent people everywhere should reject it"".
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant dismissed the ruling, saying Israel ""does not need to be lectured on morality in order to distinguish between terrorists and the civilian population in Gaza"".
A spokesman for Hamas, the Palestinian group whose unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October triggered the war, called the outcome ""important"", saying it contributed to ""isolating Israel"", Reuters news agency reported.
The ICJ ordered Israel to take a series of measures against potentially genocidal acts against Palestinians in Gaza. These include measures not only on the battlefield but also against public incitement to genocide. It also ordered Israel to take ""immediate and effective measures"" to enable the provision of aid to people in Gaza.
The court said Israel must report on its compliance to the court within one month.
Although orders issued by the ICJ are legally binding, it does not have the power to enforce them. Israel is not expected to commit itself to the orders.
More than 26,000 Palestinians - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza by Israel's bombardment since 7 October, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. Israel launched its offensive after waves of Hamas gunmen burst through the border early that day, killing about 1,300 people - mainly civilians - and taking about 250 others back to Gaza as hostages.

OV8I269OIT_BN1UPX84S0UTCWR,Israel-Gaza war: IDF says 24 soldiers killed in Gaza in one day,By Yolande Knell,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68065903,"The Israeli army says 24 of its soldiers were killed in Gaza on Monday - the deadliest day for its forces since their ground operation began.
That includes 21 reservists who died in an explosion likely caused by mines that Israeli forces had placed in two buildings to demolish them, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.
The IDF later said rocket-propelled grenade fire triggered the explosion.
""A militant squad surprised the force with RPG fire,"" a spokesman said.
""The first rocket hit one of the buildings in which explosives had been laid out. The hit apparently led to the explosion that caused the collapse of the building and the building next to it,"" Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari added.
According to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, 195 Palestinians have been killed in the past day.
In an earlier briefing, Rear Admiral Hagari said the reservists were killed in central Gaza at around 16:00 (14:00 GMT) on Monday - close to the kibbutz of Kissufim on the Israeli side of the border.
They were involved in an operation to allow for residents of southern Israel to safely return to their homes after tens of thousands were evacuated after the Hamas attack on 7 October.
The first funerals for those killed in the explosion have been held at Mount Herzl in a rainy Jerusalem.
Many of the mourners wore military uniforms and the scene was full of blue and white Israeli flags.
Israel's military had already confirmed that three officers were killed in a separate attack in southern Gaza on Monday.
The country's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that despite its suffering, his country would push on with its offensive until it had ""absolute victory.""
Elsewhere in Gaza, there has been fierce fighting by three hospitals in Khan Younis in the south, which is crowded with displaced people.
The IDF announced it has completely encircled the city, which has been a main focus of its ground offensive targeting Hamas.
Israel believes that the group's leaders may be hiding there and that it may also be where some Israeli hostages are being held.
According to the IDF, dozens of local gunmen were killed in its operation and its forces found rockets in rocket-launchers ready to fire, as well as tunnel shafts and a large number of weapons.
The Palestinians said that women and children have been killed in the latest fighting in the city.
They added that Israeli blockades and the storming of hospitals since Monday had left the wounded and dead beyond the reach of rescuers.
The dead were being buried inside the grounds of Nasser hospital because it has been unsafe to leave in order to reach the cemetery.
It is said that Israeli forces stormed another hospital, Al-Khair - which is in the al-Mawasi area to the west - and arrested staff.
Israel launched the war with the declared aim of destroying Hamas after waves of its gunmen killed 1,300 people - mostly civilians - and took about 250 others hostage in the unprecedented attack.
According to the IDF website, 217 soldiers have been killed since the beginning of Israel's ground invasion on 27 October out of a total of 552 killed since 7 October.
At least 25,490 people - mainly women and children - have been killed in the Israeli military campaign in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

Twenty-six hikers paid Eryri-based Aspire Adventures up to Â£3,500 each to scale Africa's highest mountain, Kilimanjaro.
But on Friday, as they arrived in Tanzania, they received an email to say no services would be provided.
Aspire Adventures has been contacted for comment.
Most of the group were raising money for Hope4, which helps Ukrainian refugees and orphans in Moldova.
Between them they had paid tens of thousands of pounds to Aspire Adventures, in Brynrefail, Gwynedd, to cover costs for accommodation, equipment and guides.
Jason Rawles, who owns Aspire Adventures, was supposed to be joining the group on the expedition on Friday morning.
But he sent an email instead as they started to arrive in Tanzania, telling them his company was no longer able to provide the services and assistance they had paid for.
The email, seen by BBC Wales, said the firm had been ""hit by a series of events outside of our control"".
Mr Rawles continued: ""I have tried everything, and I do mean everything.
""We have now just run out of options and cash flow is just one of many things that have happened all at the same time.""
Mr Rawles wrote he was ""desperately sorry"", adding: ""The reality is we cannot make payment for what is needed for your Kilimanjaro trip.""
Lea Turner, one of the trustees of the Hope4 Charity, was on her way to Africa to join the expedition when she saw the email.
She said she was ""in tears"" and felt ""responsible"" after leading the way on booking the trip.
But she added the group had all been ""determined"" to carry on regardless.
They managed to get $80,000 (Â£63,180) together to pay the bills, borrowing money from relatives and savings.
They have also set up an online fundraising page to help make the shortfall, with any surplus donations going to Hope4.
They are now three days into the mountain ascent.
An automated email response from Jason Rawles and Aspire Adventures says the company is taking a break until March.
It goes on to say that it is the company's ""intention"" to deliver any trips booked from April onwards, but adds: ""All social media channels are deactivated in the meantime.""
Aspire Adventures was founded by Jason Rawles in 2013, and organises expeditions to locations including Tanzania, Nepal and Mont Blanc in France.
North Wales Police said it had received correspondence from Hope4 and was reviewing that information.
""At this time, it would not be appropriate to comment any further,"" the force said.

Residents are being asked to share their views on plans for a so-called super nature reserve on the England-Wales border.
Proposals are being floated to extend the existing Stiperstones National Nature Reserve in Shropshire by up to 5,000 hectares (20 sq miles).
The reserve is made up of a wild landscape of uplands, lowlands and woodland that attracts birds and rare wildlife.
Natural England wants to incorporate surrounding land and make the area bigger.
The body has asked people living nearby to share their thoughts on the idea.
A public drop-in session will take place between 18:00 and 21:00 GMT on Wednesday 7 February at the village hall in Snailbeach.
The area is known for its unique rock formations overlooking the landscape
Emma Johnson, deputy director for Natural England in the West Midlands, said there was a great opportunity to create a better and bigger place for people and wildlife.
She claimed a more joined-up approach would help soak up huge amounts of carbon and reduce flooding downstream.
""A super national nature reserve joining up land with partners would be so beneficial,"" she said.
""Thereâll be lots of information about the proposal. We really want to hear what people think.â
The Stiperstones will be one of the King's Series of national nature reserves which was launched last year to celebrate the Coronation of King Charles III.

P82YKKMTNB_8X5A9FLTDNYYL90,German court ban on state funding for Heimat seen as model for AfD,By Damien McGuinness,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68072437,"Germany's constitutional court has ruled that a right-wing extremist party should be barred from receiving further state funding and tax breaks that German parties legally receive.
The court's ruling on excluding Die Heimat, formerly known as the NPD, comes after days of German protests against the rise of the far right.
A million Germans have taken part.
The ruling also marks the first time that Germany has cut state financial support for a party without banning it.
Many now see this as a model for dealing with increasing support for the far-right Alternative for Germany party.
Nationally the AfD polls typically above 20% at the moment, and above 30% in eastern Germany, where key regional elections will be held later this year.
So the constitutional court's decision in Karlsruhe is a boost for the protesters who have filled the streets of German towns and cities in recent days, including Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt and Berlin.
Organised by church groups, environmentalists and left-wing activists, Sunday's demo against the far right in Berlin was large, with more than 100,000 people, and certainly diverse.
Two elderly Catholic nuns carried a homemade cardboard sign against right-wing extremism.
Nearby a gay couple held up a colourful banner while a toddler strapped in the front of a passing cargo-bike sang ""all of Berlin hates the AfD"".
Tuesday's court ruling comes after earlier unsuccessful attempts to ban Die Heimat's predecessor outright.
In 2017 a case to outlaw the then NPD failed for the second time, after judges ruled that the party was too insignificant to be banned. The court did however accept that the NPD's racist, ethno-nationalist stance made the party unconstitutional and anti-democratic.
That decision paved the way for a case to be made that a party that was trying to undermine the German democratic state should not receive taxpayer support.
The Heimat (Homeland) party only has a few thousand members and for the past few years has received no direct funding because its share of the vote in elections is too small. But it does benefit from sizeable tax breaks on donations and money bequeathed.
Cutting these benefits effectively wipes out the party's funds.
Not everyone at the mass anti-AfD demonstrations - organised by political leaders, trade unions, religious groups and grassroots NGOs such as ""Grannies against the far-right"" - wants the AfD to be banned.
Some fear that would simply play into the party's narrative that it is being victimised by mainstream society and would galvanise support.
There are also high legal hurdles to banning a party. Constitutionally it is possible, but it is difficult to prove that an entire party is anti-democratic or unconstitutional, rather than just individual MPs or members. Particularly since the AfD is a large and diverse party, whose leaders are careful to stay on the right side of the law.
Some politicians have called for state funding for the AfD to be cut, as has happened with Die Heimat, claiming that legally this may be more feasible. But the case to stop financing Die Heimat was successful because the party had already been judged as unconstitutional, so the legal hurdles may not in fact be much lower.
Either way, for protesters calling for action against the far-right, Tuesday's court ruling may feel like progress.

PDO8VRJ63T_3Y0YK79OJTTPEIY,"How many countries still have the death penalty, and how many people are executed?",_,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-45835584,"A convicted murderer in the US has become the first person in the country to be executed using nitrogen gas.
A Japanese man has also been sentenced to death by hanging for an arson attack which killed 36 people.
The number of executions is rising globally, despite many countries abolishing the use of capital punishment.
According to the latest figures from Amnesty International, in 2022:
The Amnesty International figures are compiled from official statistics, media reports and information passed on from individuals sentenced to death, and their families and representatives.
The organisation believes that China is the world's leading executioner, killing thousands of people every year. But because China does not release details about its use of the death penalty, it is impossible to provide reliable numbers.
Besides China, Amnesty International recorded 883 executions worldwide in 2022, the highest number of executions since 2017.
However, it is much lower than the figures for 1988, 1989 or 2015, when more than 1,500 people were executed in a single year.
Amnesty International also says at least 2,016 death sentences were imposed in 2022, across 52 countries.
Globally, it believes at least 28,282 people were under sentence of death at the end of 2022.
Many prisoners spend years or even decades on death row before their execution.
Twenty countries executed people in 2022, compared with 18 in 2021.
Apart from China, the countries which executed the most people were Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the US.
Amnesty says it recorded at least three public executions in Iran in 2022.
It says Iran also executed at least five people for offences carried out when they were under 18 years old.
The Amnesty International report highlights 11 countries in the world which persistently execute people every year.
These include China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the US, Vietnam and Yemen.
Amnesty International also believes that North Korea is ""likely to be using the death penalty at a sustained rate"", but cannot independently verify this.
Saudi Arabia's execution figure in 2022 was the highest for 30 years.
Five countries - Bahrain, Comoros, Laos, Niger and South Korea - sentenced people to death in 2022, having not used the death penalty for several years.
Although the number of executions in the US has risen since 2021, it remains well below the 1999 peak.
Amnesty International says there were 325 executions for drug offences worldwide in 2022 including:
In 2023, Singapore executed the first woman for almost 20 years. Saridewi Djaman was convicted of trafficking heroin in 2018.
The death penalty is not used at all in 112 countries, compared with 48 in 1991.
Six countries abolished the death penalty either fully, or partially, in 2022.
Four - Kazakhstan, Papua New Guinea, Sierra Leone and the Central African Republic - scrapped it completely.
Equatorial Guinea and Zambia said it would only be used for the most serious crimes.
In April 2023, Malaysia's parliament also voted to remove the mandatory death penalty for 11 serious crimes, including murder and terrorism.
Ghana's parliament voted to abolish the death penalty altogether in July 2023.
Saudi Arabia was the only country to list beheading as the method of execution in 2022.
Other methods included hanging, lethal injection and death by shooting.
The US state of Alabama is due to execute a convicted murderer called Kenneth Smith using nitrogen gas.
He will be the first person to be put to death by this method anywhere in the world, according to the US-based Death Penalty Information Center.
Mr Smith's lawyers called the untested method a ""cruel and unusual"" punishment.
Alabama and two other US states approved the use of nitrogen because the drugs which are more commonly used in lethal injections have become more difficult to find.
Drug shortages have contributed to the fall in the use of the death penalty across the US."
PH4M336P2I_OVD0UBGGDF3VO4V,UK officials probe Iran generals' antisemitic talks to students,By Ed Thomas,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68016330,"This video can not be played
Watch: Clips of Iran generals' speeches to UK students
Videos of antisemitic speeches by Iranian generals, given to UK students, are being investigated by the Charity Commission.
The regulator is also looking at footage of ""death to Israel"" chants at an Islamic charity's UK premises.
Verified by the BBC, two of the videos show talks by members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. One described an apocalyptic war on Jews.
The group that promoted the online talks said it respects all communities.
The footage - which also includes a denial of the Holocaust - adds to growing concerns from some MPs that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is attempting to radicalise UK Muslims. Security services have also warned it is inciting violence and plotting to kidnap or kill people on British soil.
One of the most powerful paramilitary organisations in the Middle East, the IRGC controls the Iranian government's foreign covert operations and supports militant groups such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen.
The IRGC has previously been linked to kidnap and assassination plots in the UK. Counter-terror police confirmed in February last year that 15 such plots had come out of Iran since 2020, and the BBC has since been told there has been at least one more.
The videos seen by the BBC were recorded in 2020 and 2021 and show three events.
Two were live-streamed speeches by former and active IRGC commanders.
The other was an in-person event inside the Kanoon Towhid Islamic centre in west London, commemorating Iran's top military commander Gen Qasem Soleimani, who was killed in a US air strike in 2020. Chants of ""death to Israel"" were heard at the event, but it is not known who was saying them.
The BBC has also seen evidence of another online talk to UK students by an IRGC commander who has since boasted of his role in training Hamas before the 7 October attacks.
The online talks were promoted in advance by the Islamic Students Associations of Britain (ISA) and its affiliates, which use the Kanoon Towhid centre as a meeting place. Unlike the UK's main Muslim student groups, the ISA was founded to promote the philosophy of the leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini.
Kanoon Towhid is owned by the Al-Tawheed (TUCF) Charitable Trust. The trust was already being investigated by the Charity Commission after reports of the event honouring Gen Soleimani, who was sanctioned by the UK for his links to terrorism. The commission is now examining the videos seen by the BBC, which include footage of this event.
The commission's chair, Orlando Fraser, has previously warned that charities must not ""become forums for hate speech"" or extremism. The Charity Commission has the power to investigate, sanction or close down charities which breach the regulations.
Conservative MP Alicia Kearns, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, described the speeches as a ""brazen act of radicalisation"". She said the IRGC should be added to the list of proscribed terrorist groups in the UK, meaning it would be illegal to be an IRGC member or to show support for them.
In one recording - an Instagram Live from Iran in September 2020 which has been viewed about 1,500 times - IRGC commander Hossein Yekta said universities had become ""the battlefront"" and urged the students listening to become ""soft-war officers"".
Kasra Aarabi - director of IRGC research at the US-based campaign group United Against Nuclear Iran, and who shared the videos with the BBC - said ""soft-war officers"" is a term used by Iran to describe recruits to its ideological battle with the West. He said it was coined by a branch of the IRGC, ""which today is proactively conducting terror plots on British soil"".
Ali Ansari, a professor of Iranian history at the University of St Andrews, said the talks reflected ""an attempt to encourage disruption, discontent, and basically undermine the stability of Western society, and what we need is a much more robust response to it"".
Prof Ansari said proscribing the IRGC as a terrorist organisation would be difficult, as it is an arm of the Iranian state. But he said the UK government could still shut down its activities.
The other video of an online talk seen by the BBC, this time from January 2021, again glorified the death of Gen Soleimani.
Seen by tens of thousands of people, the video shows former IRGC commander Gen Saeed Ghasemi comparing Soleimani's death to the Hollywood film Terminator 2, saying that after Soleimani was attacked, the broken pieces would come back together, stronger than before.
""You killed Qasem,"" he said, referring to the US, ""but he shattered into millions of hearts in the Islamic world. You can no longer stand in his way.""
In the footage, Gen Ghasemi also falsely claimed the Holocaust was ""a lie and a fake"" and described an apocalyptic war that the British students could join to ""bring an end to the life of the oppressors and occupiers, Zionists and Jews across the world"".
He added: ""God willing, myself and you good students in Europe will be written in the beautiful list of the soldiers of the resistance from tonight.""
In addition to the videos, the BBC has seen promotional posts dating from November 2020 for another talk to British students featuring elite former IRGC commander Ezzatollah Zarghami. Mr Zarghami, who is sanctioned in the UK for human rights abuses, posted a picture of himself on his Telegram social media account speaking live over Zoom on the evening of the talk.
Mr Zarghami was part of a group of radical students who stormed the US embassy in Tehran in 1979, holding Americans hostage for more than a year. He is currently the minister of Cultural Heritage and Tourism in Iran and has since boasted of training Hamas in Gaza prior to the 7 October attacks. In an interview on Iranian state TV, he also described how he had provided Hamas with missiles.
Online adverts for the speeches in the videos displayed the logo of the Islamic Students Associations of Britain. In one of the videos, the association's name is spelled out on the screen in Farsi.
And the Instagram Live event from September 2020 was hosted by Mohammadhussain Ataee, a British citizen educated in Yorkshire who was secretary of the Islamic Students Associations of Britain at the time. It is the only video he appears in and he is no longer the secretary of the organisation.
However, Mr Ataee is still the secretary of the Union of Islamic Students Associations of Europe - an umbrella body that includes the British organisation. In January last year, he was granted an audience in Tehran with Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Mr Ataee said the allegations against him are false, but would not answer the BBC's questions. He has previously said he does not have direct or indirect affiliation to the IRGC, or any army, government or security group in the world.
He added the Islamic Students Associations have never had any ""physical gathering in Kanoon Towhid or anywhere else with any of the falsely accused individuals"".
Mr Ataee also said the students association was a democratic organisation which makes its decisions through an executive committee, not through one person.
After watching the footage of IRGC commanders, the foreign affairs committee chair Ms Kearns urged the government to make such events illegal, adding the videos depicted ""a risk to the stability of our country"".
""It makes me really worried about the state of our society, everyone should be horrified by what they're seeing in those videos,"" she said. ""It's division, it's hatred. It's inciting violence, potentially it's incredibly serious.""
She said the IRGC had to be proscribed and ""they are aiding and abetting people who would commit terrorism on our soil"".
One of the people who says he is under threat is Vahid Beheshti, a British-Iranian journalist and human rights activist. He told the BBC police have warned him his life is at risk.
""Every day that I wake up, I think this is my last day,"" said Mr Beheshti, who has been holding a sit-in protest outside the Foreign Office for almost a year. He said in the past few weeks he had been approached and was told: ""I'm gonna cut your neck"".
Mr Beheshti said he believes the small group of people targeting him are IRGC agents, operating freely in the UK.
The government says it keeps the list of proscribed organisations under review, but it has a policy not to comment on whether a specific organisation is or is not being considered.
A spokesperson said: ""We have sanctioned more than 350 Iranian individuals and entities, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in its entirety.""
The Islamic Students Association of Britain told the BBC it is an independent group led by student volunteers with no affiliations to any government.
The association said it respects people from all backgrounds, faiths and communities and ""does not support or endorse anyone that does not share these values"". It added that ""all its activities are clearly lawful"".
The Al-Tawheed (TUCF) Charitable Trust, which runs the Kanoon Towhid centre, was repeatedly contacted for comment but did not respond.

PHWH6DWSUA_RIKLLYCOWQLPCEX,Giraffe Benito escapes extreme temperatures for new home,By Bernd Debusmann Jr.,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-68061512,"A giraffe named Benito has left his home in Mexico's arid north to begin a 2,000km-trip (1,200 miles) to more temperate climates further south.
Benito's voyage follows a long campaign by activists who warned that he was suffering in the extreme climates of the border city of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez.
To reach his new home, Benito is travelling in a purpose-built 5m-tall container.
Some activists shouted ""we love you"" as he began his trip.
Until his departure, the three-year-old Benito had been kept in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez's Parque Central zoo.
Activists had long warned that the city's desert climate - which can reach a a sweltering 42C (108F) in the summer and dip as low as freezing in the winter - was difficult for giraffes and that the zoo was not properly equipped to handle the animals.
A second giraffe which was kept at the zoo, Modesto, died in 2022.
The operation to move Benito began early on Monday morning, when the container in which he will travel was loaded onto a truck.
Benito had been allowed to familiarise himself with the container over the weekend.
The container is designed so that he can peek his head out from inside but can be covered with a tarp to protect him from the elements and potentially stressful sights and sounds.
The trip to his new home - a safari park in the state of Puebla - is expected to take approximately 50 hours.
Frank Carlos Camacho, the director of the safari park where Benito is headed, said that the container had cameras and sensors installed to allow his keepers to monitor him, as well as enough alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and water to keep him fed along the way.
""We can check his temperature, and even talk to him through a microphone that's inside the container,"" Mr Camacho said. ""He's very well.""
At his new home in Puebla's African Safari park, visitors will be able to see him in a more natural habitat from all-terrain vehicles.
In an interview with Mexico's Animal Politico news outlet, activist Perla Iris GuzmÃ¡n - a member of the ""Let's Save Benito"" collective -  thanked ""all the people who made this movement grow"".
""This is an accomplishment of the entire JuÃ¡rez community,"" she said. ""[They] believed in us and went to the zoo to see what we meant about the 'little' animals.""

Windrush victims need similar support to those affected by the Post Office scandal, a top barrister says
Former adviser to the Windrush compensation scheme Martin Forde KC has become one of its leading critics
Thousands of British people were wrongly classified as illegal immigrants in the scandal, which came to light in 2018
Critics say the compensation process moves at a ""glacial"" pace - but the Home Office says it is making improvements
Windrush victims deserve a compensation scheme similar to those affected by the Post Office scandal, a leading barrister says.
The Home Office appointed Martin Forde KC in 2018 to oversee the Windrush compensation scheme - but he has since become one of its fiercest critics.
He told BBC News the process for Windrush victims to claim compensation âis still very document heavyâ and moves at a âglacialâ pace.
The Home Office says it has paid more than Â£75m to victims and is improving the scheme, so people can receive as much compensation as quickly as possible.
Who are the Windrush generation?
Why were hundreds of Post Office workers prosecuted?
Disappointment after three Windrush reforms dropped
A government spokesperson said each claim was ""personal"" to the claimant and ""deserves to be processed with the utmost care and sensitivity"".
The Windrush scandal unfolded in April 2018, after it was revealed thousands of British people were wrongly classed as illegal immigrants.
Many were wrongly deported, while others faced difficulty securing work, accessing healthcare or finding somewhere to live.
Most people affected were of Caribbean origin and arrived in the UK between 1948 and 1971.
In September last year, the Home Office announced it would be disbanding its team dedicated to Windrush policy.

Mr Forde said the Windrush compensation scheme âcries out for legal aidâ and âpeople still arenât getting the assistance that they needâ five years after the system was introduced.
He had every sympathy for the postmasters who had fallen victim to the Post Office scandal but had become âincreasingly irritatedâ by the gulf in expertise working on those cases compared with for Windrush victims.
The Post Office scandal has been called the biggest miscarriage of justice in UK history, after more than 900 sub-postmasters and postmistresses were prosecuted, between 1999 and 2015, using information from faulty financial software.
It has received increased attention following ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office, with the government promising swift exoneration and compensation for victims.
Why were hundreds of Post Office workers prosecuted?

How do the Post Office compensation schemes work?
'I carried the shame - I refuse to carry it any longer'
âYouâve got retired judges, senior parliamentarians and six forensic accountants working on the postmaster scheme,â Mr Forde said.
âThere just isnât that kind of expertise being brought to bear [for the Windrush compensation scheme].
""People arenât getting future loss of earnings. Theyâre not getting loss of career. Theyâre not getting loss of promotion prospects, not getting loss of pension. Theyâre not getting any interest on what they have lost.
âAnd the whole thing is just hidebound with bureaucracy.â
Mr Forde also highlighted the age of many of the Windrush generation, saying it was important to ârealise that some of the cohort are really quite elderlyâ¦ which is why new claims would have to be inheritedâ, adding to the legal complexity of cases.

Glenda Caesar, a mother of four and grandmother of 12, who came to the UK as a baby, lost her job as an NHS administrator in 2009 and faced deportation.
She was denied the right to work for nearly a decade.
And the scandal even affected her son, born in the UK in 1988 but denied a passport.
Ms Caesar now represents other Windrush victims in their campaigns for compensation.
""I am their voice. I will speak for them. I will challenge the ministers and the heads of these schemes,"" she said.

PO24SA950Q_CQKHRSRLL78OAHK,Gustav Klimt portrait found after almost 100 years,By Bethany Bell,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68102376,"A painting by the Austrian artist Gustav Klimt, that was believed lost for 100 years, has been found in Vienna.
Portrait of Fraulein Lieser once belonged to a Jewish family in Austria and was last seen in public in 1925.
Its fate after that is unclear but the family of the current owners have had the painting since the 1960s.
The im Kinsky auction house estimates the painting's value at more than $54 million (Â£42 million).
It called the rediscovery ""a sensation"".
""A painting of such rarity, artistic significance and value has not been available on the art market in Central Europe for decades,"" im Kinsky said in a statement.
The portrait will now be put up for auction on 24 April on behalf of the owners, and the legal successors of the Lieser family.
This is based on the Washington Principles, an international agreement to return Nazi-looted art to the descendants of the people they were taken from.
Before the auction, the painting will be presented at various international locations including the UK, Switzerland, Germany and Hong Kong, the auction house said.
The portrait once belonged to the Lieser family, who were wealthy Jewish industrialists in Vienna.
Ernst Ploil, co-Managing Director of Kinsky Auction House, said they had so far found no evidence that the work had been looted or stolen before or during World War Two.
""The painting is described as lost in all catalogues raisonnÃ©s (comprehensive lists of Klimt's work). In our circles, 'lost' means probably destroyed, probably burnt during the war, but in any case no longer in existence; it was not to be expected that it would ever reappear.
""We took an active approach and not only researched the Lieser family as potential restitution claimants, but we also approached potential representatives based on our experience from previous restitution proceedings.""
Klimt's art has fetched huge sums at auction in the past.

The governor of a Scottish prison which houses a large number of ageing sex offenders has called for a secure care home to deal with elderly inmates.
Natalie Beal, the governor of HMP Glenochil, said coping with the social care needs of prisoners in their 60s and 70s was becoming a difficult issue.
Ms Beal said more than 50 of the 730 inmates at Glenochil had personalised healthcare plans and the prison was not built to cope with their needs.
The Scottish government said it had increased funding and was taking action over the ""complex"" prison population.
There are, on average, about 8,000 prisoners in Scotland at any one time and almost 700 of them are now aged over 60.
Ms Beal said the oldest inmate in HMP Glenochil, near Alloa in Clackmannanshire, was in his 80s.
She said the prison population was getting larger because of longer sentences and fewer people being released early.
The governor also said prisoners were getting older as more were being convicted of historical sex offences.
Many cells are not large enough for a hospital bed to fit in
The ageing prison population means more prisoners need social care such as assistance with washing, dressing or feeding.
Ms Beal also said many had health issues and mobility problems which required wheelchairs or hoists.
Some have had operations such as hip replacements and need rehabilitation exercises, she said. Others have dementia or neurological issues.
""We were not built with an ageing population in mind,"" Ms Beal said
""We don't have enough space,"" she said. ""We don't have enough accessible cells.
""We need to think about something like a secure care home.
""We have people whose needs are wider than a secure prison regime.""
Ms Beal said that a secure old people's home would need a higher ratio of trained staff to each prisoner and would be expensive.
The amount the Scottish Prison Service spends on social care has already been increasing for the past five years.
Figures released to BBC Scotland under freedom of information show that Â£636,000 was spent in 2018 but this more than trebled to Â£2.1m in 2022.
Ms Beal said Â£500,000 of the prison social care budget was spent at her prison.
Glenochil prison holds 730 inmates
Howard League Scotland, which campaigns for prison reform, said the percentage of prisoners over 50 had more than doubled in a decade, from 6.5% in 2010-11 to 14.8% in 2022-23.
It said it was very sobering to go into a prison and see banks of wheelchairs and hoists for prisoners with mobility issues.
The campaign group also said there were significant numbers of prisoners who required 24-hour a day social care because they cannot wash, dress or feed themselves.
Social care is the responsibility of Scottish Prison Service (SPS) while healthcare is an NHS issue.
A Scottish government spokesperson said it was increasing the SPS budget by 10% despite a tight settlement from the UK government..
âThe safety and wellbeing of everyone in the prison estate is a priority for us and the Scottish Prison Service and we are taking action in relation to the increasingly complex prison population,"" they said.
""The additional funding for SPS is a crucial component of that, enabling them to continue to provide a safe and secure prison system.â

PU68WMF13Y_8AJTHL0HI1PXL3B,Gary Baird: Wife of murder accused 'sent divorce intent letter' in 2017,_,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-68096929,"A Belfast woman sent a solicitor's letter to her husband notifying him of her intention to initiate divorce proceedings three years before he killed her, a court has heard.
Susan Baird, 60, died at her home in Windermere Road in the Four Winds area of south Belfast in August 2020.
Gary Alexander Baird, 64, has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of his wife but not guilty to murder.
The prosecution has rejected the former security guard's plea.
During the fourth day of the hearing at Belfast Crown Court, the jury heard a series of statements from family, friends and colleagues of Susan Baird.
CCTV footage which depicted a collision between Gary Baird and a bin lorry in the centre of Belfast 10 days before the hammer attack was also played.
The recording captured Mr Baird walking along Bedford Street, crossing the road then walking back on to the road where he was hit by the bin lorry.
This resulted in Mr Baird requiring hospital treatment for serious wounds to his left hand.
A prosecuting barrister addressed the five men and seven women of the jury and provided them with a series of agreed facts and background details.
She revealed that Mrs Baird was referred to a counsellor in October 2016 and that she attended eight sessions on her own for ""relationship and marriage difficulties"".
In January 2017, a solicitor acting on behalf of Mrs Baird wrote a letter to Gary Baird to notify him of her intention to initiate divorce proceedings.
In April of that year, the couple commenced counselling together with the Christian Guidelines charity which continued until August 2017.
The prosecuting barrister then referred to statements from relatives, friends and colleagues of the mother-of-four, who worked as an administrator at Orangefield Presbyterian Church.
The prosecuting barrister said: ""Over the years, Susan Baird spoke to all three of her siblings about difficulties in their marriage.
""Susan told her siblings that there were many occasions when they would not speak to each other.
""After Gary's accident on 6 August 2020, Susan updated her siblings by text.
""She said that Gary was pacing the floors.
""She texted her sister expressing concerns about Gary being discharged from hospital and that she feared he would become even more weird and how she would cope with this.""
The prosecuting barrister also referred to a statement made by a friend of Susan Baird which detailed how Mrs Baird contacted a solicitor about divorcing her husband, but then went to counselling.
""The friends last spoke in May 2020, when it was Susan's 60th birthday, and Susan appeared quite flustered,"" the barrister said.
""Susan told her Gary was not coping well with lockdown and being stuck inside.""
A colleague who worked with Mrs Baird in the church made a statement detailing his knowledge of her marriage difficulties.
The lawyer added: ""He was aware that in or around 2017, Susan was looking for another property.
""He knew that Susan has gone to counselling and that she decided to stay with Gary.""
The minister of Orangefield Presbyterian Church also made a statement with the prosecuting barrister, telling the jury: ""Susan told him there were tensions in the marriage... and she felt Gary's behaviour put their marriage under pressure.
""By June 2017, she told him it was a miracle her and Gary were moving in the right direction and talking more, and she described the relationship as not perfect but that they worked through issues together.""
Another colleague from the church gave a statement, with the lawyer telling the jury: ""Susan told her that since 2015 Gary had become more paranoid.
""Over the summer of 2020, Susan told her colleague that Gary's paranoia was getting worse, that he was pacing up and down, not speaking and wringing his hands - and that she was reluctant to go home as she would have to deal with whatever mood he was in.
""The last time this friend saw Susan Baird was on 14 August when she appeared in good spirits.""
The trial continues."
PWKGUJV4LX_X5SB4L295AJF4EV,Cirencester mum's brain tumour mistaken for perimenopause,By Steve Mather,7 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-68020278,"A mother-of-three was told her migraines and extreme fatigue were signs of perimenopause, before an emergency scan revealed a brain tumour.
Pippa Griffiths, 45, initially put her symptoms down to stress but said nothing would work to control the pain.
After an MRI showed a mass on her brain, she had surgery to remove the tumour in October 2023.
Ms Griffiths, from Cirencester in Gloucestershire, now wants to raise awareness of brain tumours.
""Being told that it was a tumour was obviously a shock to me,"" she said.
Ms Griffiths said a low point had been when she had to be given CPR by her sister during a 45-minute seizure.
""Had I not been staying with my sister when it happened, I don't think I'd be here today,"" she said.
""My driving licence was taken away due to the risk of a seizure. I thought it could be down to stress after moving from France to the UK.
""I tried everything to control the pain in my head including cool packs on my forehead. Nothing worked,"" added Ms Griffiths.
Ms Griffiths said her symptoms of extreme fatigue and headaches started about three-and-a-half years ago, while she was still living in France.
After about a year, when they were starting to get worse, she went to see a doctor who prescribed painkillers.
She moved back to the UK in January 2023 and straight away went to see an optician who said her eyesight was fine and advised seeing a doctor again.
""They issued more meds for the migraines,"" she said.
It was when she woke up with a numb feeling down one side of her face in September 2023 that she was taken for an MRI scan which showed a meningioma growing on her brain.
Following her surgery, the former photographer, who now works as a nursery assistant, is monitored with regular scans.
Despite the risk of the tumour returning, she has decided not to have any further treatment because of the possible side-effects and long-term damage to her body.
""When the doctor listed the possible side effects of radiotherapy, I made the decision not to pursue that treatment,"" she said.
""I was warned that it could cause cognitive decline, cataracts and pituitary gland damage which could lead to further surgeries and life-long medication.
""Being a mum to three children aged between 23 and seven, I wasn't prepared to take that risk. I want to be well enough to enjoy seeing my children grow up,"" added Ms Griffiths.
Three months after surgery, she is now well enough to take part in a walking fundraiser for the charity Brain Tumour Research.
She added: ""My migraines have stopped and the brain fog has lifted.
""I'm fine, loads of energy. I feel like I'm 10 years younger.""
""It's incredibly important to raise awareness of brain tumours. Not only to understand their symptoms and causes, but also kinder treatments and ultimately a cure.""
She said the symptoms are ""the same really"" as perimenopause, so she does not blame the doctors for not spotting the tumour earlier.
Brain Tumour Research said one in three people know someone affected by a brain tumour, but just 1% of the national spend on cancer research has been allocated to brain tumours since records began in 2002.
Mel Tiley, community development manager, said: ""The fact that Ms Griffiths has declined any further treatment at this stage due to the side effects of current brain tumour treatment demonstrates the need for greater investment to research the disease.""

Q17P7WWB0Y_JWOE9T0P3SM102B,Supreme Court allows agents to cut razor wire at Texas-Mexico border,By Max Matza,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68064246,"The US Supreme Court has ruled that border patrol agents can remove razor wire that has been installed by Texas officials along the US-Mexico border.
The 5-4 ruling on Monday temporarily pauses a lower court's ruling that forced the federal agents to stop cutting wire near Eagle Pass, Texas.
The fencing had been authorised by Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott.
The Biden White House requested that agents be allowed to continue cutting the wire, arguing it harms migrants.
Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the court's three liberal justices to rule in favour of the White House request.
None of the judges offered an explanation for their votes.
Lawyers for the Biden administration say the wire restricts the ability of border agents to process migrants who have already arrived on US soil.
Mr Abbott's government has also installed buoys along the Rio Grande river, as part of a larger effort to deter illegal migration known as Operation Lone Star.
The Biden administration is challenging the buoys in a separate federal case.
The roughly 30-mile (46-km) razor fence has been criticised by Mexican officials as a violation of international law. Migrants have been known to bypass the wire, swimming and climbing under it, often getting injured in the process.
The Eagle Pass area, where the fencing and buoys are located, has seen about 270,000 migrant detentions this fiscal year.
Operation Lone Star also includes sending migrants in buses to Democratic-run cities.
Last year, Texas sued the federal government after Border Patrol agents cut through portions of the fencing, arguing that they were unable to reach the border they police.
It has been seen as a major escalation in the legal battles over immigration between Joe Biden, a Democrat, and Mr Abbott.
The federal government has failed to prevent unlawful entry into the United States, Texas argues. In their court filing for the razor wire case, they say that areas like Eagle Pass are at the ""epicenter of this crisis"".
Earlier this month, Texas officials seized a park along the border and declared that federal agents were banned from accessing it.
Last week, Texas ignored a demand from the Department of Homeland Security to resume federal access to the park, which is used by agents to patrol the border.
The Department of Homeland Security said two children and one woman drowned in the Rio Grande River this month after Border Patrol agents were ""were physically barred by Texas officials from entering the area"".
The Texas Military Department disputed the statement, and said it had found no evidence of migrants in distress.

Q20XJDGCUN_QPMK9JACOYGZ6UJ,Tesla warns of 'notably lower' sales growth in 2024,By Natalie Sherman,4 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68086212,"Tesla is forecasting a sharp sales slowdown this year, becoming the latest car company to warn of sagging demand.
Elon Musk's electric vehicle (EV) maker said growth would be ""notably lower"" than in 2023, when deliveries rose 38%.
The company's shares fell by almost 6% in extended trade in New York after the announcement.
Mr Musk also warned that Chinese rivals ""will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world"" unless trade barriers are put in place.
Tesla slashed prices repeatedly last year in a bid to keep demand up.
The moves helped the firm sell a record 1.8 million cars in 2023, up nearly 40% from 2022.
But revenue grew at about half that pace, slowing precipitously at the end of the year.
In its quarterly update to investors, Tesla said it was not expecting another big wave of expansion until it launches a new model.
The company has been discussing plans for a compact car that would be less expensive than its current Model Y, which starts around Â£45,000 in the UK.
""Our company is currently between two major growth waves: the first one began with the global expansion of the Model 3/Y platform and the next one we believe will be initiated by the global expansion of the next-generation vehicle platform,"" it said.
Mr Musk's call for trade barriers in the increasingly competitive market came after China's BYD overtook Tesla as the world's top-selling electric carmaker in the last three months of 2023.
Wednesday's sales slowdown warning also came amid wider signs of weakness in the EV market, after several years of robust growth.
In the UK, sales of electric vehicles rose last year, but failed to make inroads against traditional cars as a portion of overall sales.
In China, the biggest market for such cars, manufacturers have slashed prices as the economy slows, while in Europe, sales of battery electric cars shrank sharply last month, falling nearly 17% compared with December 2022, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.
In the US, major car companies, including Ford and General Motors, have said they are scaling back production of electric vehicles.
Around 1.1 million battery electric cars sold in the country last year, up nearly 50% over 2022 and more than double 2021, according to the government.
Tesla said in the last three months of 2023, revenue was $25.1bn (Â£19.7bn), up just 3% compared with the same period in 2022. Its profits were lower than many analysts had expected.

Q305SUTFKN_N7XABRIJEIEBX6S,"Britain must train citizen army, military chief warns","By Jonathan Beale, defence correspondent & Doug Faulkner",4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68086188,"Britain should train a ""citizen army"" ready to fight a war on land in the future, the head of the Army has said.
General Sir Patrick Sanders warned that an increase in reserve forces alone ""would not be enough"".
He highlighted the threat from Russia and pointed to steps being taken by other European nations to put their populations on a ""war footing"".
He also called for more to be done to equip and modernise the UK's armed forces.
In a speech at an armoured vehicle conference, Gen Sir Patrick was not making an argument for conscription - where men of fighting age are required to enlist in the military - but rather laying the foundations for a voluntary call up if war broke out.
He talked about the need for the UK's ""pre-war generation"" to prepare for the possibility of war and said that was a ""whole-of-nation undertaking"".
This is not the first time Gen Sir Patrick has warned of the increasing threat of war and expressed concerns about Britain's lack of readiness.
On Wednesday, the outgoing Chief of the General Staff (CGS) said Russia's war in Ukraine was about much more than seizing territory, saying it was about defeating our system and way of life.
He has already argued to reverse to recent cuts to the size of the Army. It is now a professional force of around 73,000, compared to around 100,000 in 2010.
In his speech he said Britain needed an army designed to expand rapidly.
""Within the next three years, it must be credible to talk of a British Army of 120,000, folding in our reserve and strategic reserve. But this is not enough,"" he said, as he also called for more to be done to modernise and equip the armed forces.
""We will not be immune and as the pre-war generation we must similarly prepare - and that is a whole-of-nation undertaking,"" he said. ""Ukraine brutally illustrates that regular armies start wars; citizen armies win them.
""But we've been here before, and workforce alone does not create capability.""
He highlighted steps being taken in countries like Sweden and Finland - where the threat of Russia looms closer - to put their nations more on a war footing.
Other senior Nato military commanders have also recently been calling on the alliance to ready itself for a potential conflict.
Such warnings make politicians nervous.
In response to Gen Sir Patrick speech the UK prime minister's spokesman said hypothetical scenarios of a future potential conflict were not helpful and ruled out any move towards a conscription model for the Army.
One senior Conservative MP told the BBC he did not think Rishi Sunak had fully appreciated the threat posed by Russia.
The MP said that might be because the prime minister when growing up had not experienced the existential threat posed by the old Soviet Union during the Cold War era.
Gen Sir Patrick said the nation could not afford to make the same mistakes of 1914, when it failed to perceive the escalations that led to World War One.
He said over the last 30 years the Army had halved in size, with a 28% reduction in the last 12 years, but added that despite challenges in recruitment applications to join the Army were at the highest level in six years.
Gen Sir Patrick has been a vocal critic of cuts to troop numbers and military spending and will be replaced as CGS in June by General Sir Roly Walker.
He has not been the only one to criticise cuts, with former CGS General Lord Dannatt saying the UK risked a repeat of the 1930s unless it invested more in its armed forces last week.

Q6HW385NWA_XQ5EPUDBJH0PG85,Senedd should not get Welsh police powers: Senior Labour MP,_,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-68056282,"The most senior Welsh Labour MP in Westminster has rejected fresh calls for the Welsh government to be given control of policing and adult criminal justice.
Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said Labour would be focusing at the next election on ""the things that matter"".
She spoke days after a Welsh government-commissioned report said powers were needed ""urgently"".
Plaid Cymru accused UK Labour of a ""lack of ambition"".
The policing of justice and policing has been a long held ambition of Mark Drakeford's government in Cardiff Bay, and Jo Stevens' remarks show a difference of opinion in Labour over what the future of the Welsh Parliament and Welsh government should look like.
The Welsh government has claimed it could cut the number of people in prison if it had control of law-and-order powers.
It has talked about replacing jail sentences with mental health programmes and support for drug users.
Last week the Independent Commission on the Constitutional Future of Wales said policing and criminal justice powers should be devolved, beginning with the police, probation and youth justice - although the single Conservative member of the commission disagreed with the findings.
A sub-group of the commission said that there was evidence of a ""strong case for change to secure better outcomes, better value for money, increased transparency and more accountability"".
Unlike in Scotland, where policing is overseen by the Scottish government, in Wales it is ultimately the responsibility of the UK government in Westminster.
Speaking to BBC One's Politics Wales programme, Ms Stevens said: ""We have said that we will explore the devolution of youth justice and probation.
""But we will not be looking at devolution of policing and justice.
""We will be focusing in the next election on the things that matter to people in Wales,"", she said, listing ""growing the economy, creating new jobs, getting cheaper bills, building an NHS fit for the future and breaking down barriers for opportunities for children and young people across the country.""
She promised more police, better resourced courts and ""building the prisons that the Tory government have failed to build"".
However, Ms Stevens, who is MP for Cardiff Central, promised ""strengthening of devolution"", promising a better relationship between the Welsh and UK governments.
Gordon Brown's report on Labour and devolution in 2022 said the next UK Labour government should ""embark upon the devolution of youth justice and the probation service"".
But it also suggested that the ability of Welsh institutions to handle new powers in Wales could be a reason not to go further.
It said devolution should be ""constrained only by reserving those matters which are necessary to discharge the purposes of the UK as a union, and in practice by the wishes of the Senedd itself... and of course by the practical challenges of transferring new powers and building the capability to operate them"".
The report said it expected a future Labour government to ""engage constructively"" with the recommendations of the Independent constitutional commission.
Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts said that despite this Ms Stevens ""has already outright rejected one of its key recommendations without any engagement"".
""I challenge Jo Stevens to justify why worse outcomes, reduced value for money, and a lack of transparency and accountability would be in the interest of the people of Wales.
""The lack of ambition for Wales from the incoming Labour UK government is staggering.""
In response Ms Stevens promised to deliver ""more visible policing, quicker and better court outcomes - these are the priorities of the Welsh public"".
The Welsh Conservatives' Darren Millar said: ""By Labour's Shadow Secretary of State for Wales' own admission, the Labour Welsh government are fixated on the wrong priorities.""
Jane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, added: ""The Labour party in Westminster have always been a roadblock when it comes to devolving further powers to Wales, and unfortunately it seems as though this will continue to be the case for the near future.""

Q7A5J8ENWW_CA75NB1U28C7XM0,Start-up firms frustrated by HMRC's 'slowness and lack of communication',By Dougal Shaw,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67754099,"The slowness of the UK's tax authority HMRC is holding back entrepreneurs, according to a business group.
Buy Women Built (BWB) says its members have been left frustrated when trying to access tax incentive schemes designed to support start-ups.
The group said trying to contact HMRC was ""very difficult"" and in some cases delays in receiving the tax credits meant firms could not pay bills.
HMRC said ""the overwhelming majority"" of all valid claims were paid on time.
""In recent months the female founders in our community have increasingly experienced issues accessing key government incentives aimed at boosting new businesses and innovation,"" says Sahar Hashemi, co-founder of BWB, a network of some 450 female entrepreneurs.
In particular, she points to R&D (research and development) tax credits and EIS (Enterprise Investment Scheme) tax relief.
R&D tax relief was introduced in 2000 in order to support small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) when they invest in innovation.
EIS was introduced in 1994 and makes start-ups who qualify more attractive to investors. It allows shares to be bought in a more tax-efficient way.
""We would ask that an urgent review take place on the rules around funding, to ensure that all HMRC staff are aware of the legitimacy of these claims,"" says Ms Hashemi, who co-founded High Street chain Coffee Republic and is the former co-chair of the government's Scale Up Taskforce.
She claims the issues with HMRC are hitting female-founded companies particularly hard because they currently receive only 2% of venture capital in the UK.
The number of firms on the brink of collapse jumped by more than a quarter at the end of 2023, according to the latest report from insolvency specialist Begbies Traynor. It found that 47,477 firms were in critical financial distress in the final quarter of 2023.
Its previous report, published in October, found that the number of companies going bust last year was on track to be the highest since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has promised to speed up the UK's economic growth amid flat GDP figures, and boosting entrepreneurship is one way to do this.
Last year a leading accountants' group said that understaffing at HMRC was causing unacceptable delays and hindering economic activity, with one accountant calling the service ""diabolical"".
Start-ups rely on tax incentives to stay afloat, so delays to paperwork and payments can be critical.
""There are frequently significant backlogs at HMRC to review applications, which delays the timing of the payment of the [R&D] credit,"" according to Anna Maxwell, CEO and founder of consumer healthcare company Maxwellia, which is part of the BWB group.
""For some businesses this time lag can impact cashflow, to the extent that they cannot pay their bills. HMRC are very difficult to contact and wait times on calls can be over an hour.""
R&D tax relief is a lifeline for many young companies, says Peter Cowley of Cambridge Angels, who has invested in tech start-ups for more than 15 years.
However, the process has been slow for many years, he argues.
One reason for this is that R&D tax relief has been abused by some companies and HMRC had to tighten up its procedures, he points out.
There are also HMRC delays around claiming the EIS tax relief, according to Joanna Jensen, founder of the Childs Farm skincare brand and strategic adviser to the BWB group.
""I've been waiting eight months for an EIS rebate and have now had to get my MP involved,"" says Ms Jensen.
""HMRC closed its lines over the summer,"" she adds. ""Then when we have been able to speak to anyone, they've said, 'they're looking at it next month.' If it is problematic or slow to make these rebate claims, it makes it a less attractive investment for angel investors.""
HMRC told the BBC that it could not comment on individual cases without knowing the specific details, but said in a statement: ""Public money is at stake and taxpayers rightly expect us to scrutinise claims. We do that thoroughly and fairly, and the overwhelming majority of valid claims are paid on time.""

Q8LF3AG2YU_PD05OPTITHU4U85,Dying thief stole Wizard of Oz ruby slippers as 'one last score',By Max Matza,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68062368,"Lawyers for the man who admitted to stealing ruby slippers worn in The Wizard of Oz have finally revealed his motive in a sentencing memo.
Terry Jon Martin, 76, had given up his life of crime but wanted to make ""one last score"", according to the memo.
An old mob associate convinced him to carry out the smash-and-grab heist in 2005.
He was caught more than a decade later when an FBI art crime team recovered the slippers in a sting operation.
Martin's defence lawyer Dane DeKrey wrote in the sentencing memo last week that his client had not committed any crimes in nearly ten years after last being released from prison.
But an unidentified former mob associate made contact with him and tempted him to grab the slippers, which were on loan to the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. The late actress played the slippers-wearing Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz.
""At first, Terry declined the invitation to participate in the heist. But old habits die hard, and the thought of a 'final score' kept him up at night,"" Mr DeKrey wrote.
""After much contemplation, Terry had a criminal relapse.""
He added that Martin had never seen the movie and was completely unaware of the cultural significance of the sequin-encrusted heels.
Martin, from the nearby city of Duluth, took a sledgehammer to the museum's emergency exit and lifted the shoes- which were insured at $1m (Â£824,000) - from a plexiglass-encased display pedestal, believing they were bedecked with real gemstones.
He dumped them two days later after trying to sell them and discovering that the ruby accents were actually made of glass, according to his lawyer.
The memo asked the judge to keep him out of prison and sentence him to time served due to his poor health.
Martin is currently in hospice care with a life expectancy of six months, and uses oxygen and a wheelchair, according to his lawyers.
The shoes are among only four authentic pairs that remain from the 1939 film and are often considered among the highest valued props in movie history.
Lead character Dorothy puts them on early in the film, after she lands in the Land of Oz, and uses them to return home to Kansas at the end by clicking her heels three times while repeating ""there's no place like home"".

Have you ever wondered if your dog might enjoy watching TV, and what programmes they might like?
Well, a team of researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison's School of Veterinary Medicine has been researching just that, as a way to learn more about and help assess dogs' eyesight.
Freya Mowat - a vet who specialises in eyesight and a professor at the university - said: ""We know that poor vision negatively impacts quality of life in older people, but the effect of aging and vision changes in dogs is largely unknown because we can't accurately assess it,""
So what did the results show? Well, it seems our furry friends prefer a nature documentary over a soap opera!
We want to know how your dog reacts when the TV is on? Does it chill out or get over-excited. Take part in our vote and let us know what kind of shows your dog likes and doesn't like in the comments below .

The study, published in the Applied Animal Behaviour Science journal, was launched two years ago and aimed to learn what video content engaged pooches the most.
The researchers created a questionnaire for dog owners to fill out, looking at how their dog behaved when the TV was on.
In total, 1,600 dog owners from the US, Canada, Europe, the UK and Australasia responded to the study.
From looking at the results, they found that dogs seemed more interested in watching the TV when other animals, especially dogs, were on it, and were not as interested when other humans were on it.
Around 10% of the owners said their dogs were interested in watching cartoons, and sporting/herding dogs seemed to enjoy all types of TV content more than other breeds.
Owners also said that when they were engaged, their pets' behaviour was described as ""active"", and included running, jumping, and barking, compared with more chilled behaviours like lying down or sitting.
They also found that how old a dog was, and how good its vision was, also played a factor in how much they watched the TV.
The researchers next step is to build on these findings to see how videos can be used to help track a dog's vision and how it changes as they age, to help vets diagnose any sight issues earlier.
""Like people, dogs are living longer, and we want to make sure we support a healthier life for them as well."" said Freya Mowat.

QAETR5O7OT_3NL2PKWP1TKQ2S1,Harpenden recovery driver 'abducted' under M1 bridge on a call out,By Helen Burchell and South Beds News Agency,6 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-68066153,"A breakdown recovery driver said he was abducted and had a bleach-like substance thrown over him when he was called out on a job.
The man was dispatched to recover a car in Coles Lane, underneath the M1 bridge, at Harpenden on 4 January.
Hertfordshire Police said he was taken and held prisoner for two hours by men wearing bike helmets before he was released.
Officers believe it was a ""targeted attack"".
When the victim, in his 30s, arrived at the location of the breakdown, he was met by a woman in a grey Toyota, police said.
Two or three men, wearing bike helmets, were then said to have appeared.
He reported being threatened, put in a van and had a bleach-like substance thrown over him.
They then drove to an unknown location before returning the victim to Coles Lane two hours later, at about 18:00 GMT.
The victim ran to a nearby property and called the police. He later went to hospital to be checked over.
Det Con Sophie Mansell, from the St Albans local crime unit, said: ""This was a distressing incident for the victim who continues to be supported by officers at this time.
""I understand that news of this incident is likely to cause concern among the local community, and our investigation is continuing at pace as we work around the clock to try and trace the suspects.
""We believe that this was a targeted attack and that there is no wider threat to the public.""
Police are appealing for any witnesses, or anyone who may have dashcam footage from the time to get in touch.

QBGBU220W7_7VNFQVF05CDM20C,UK citizen army: Preparing the 'pre-war generation' for conflict,By Jonathan Beale,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68097048,"Talk of wider war in Europe and the potential need for mass mobilisation or a ""citizen army"" may sound alarming. But the head of the British Army Gen Sir Patrick Sanders is not alone in issuing a national call to prepare for a major conflict on European soil.
Last week, another senior Nato military chief said countries needed to be on alert ""and expect the unexpected"". Adm Rob Bauer, who heads the alliance's military committee, said the public needed to change their mindset for an era ""when anything can happen at any time"".
The UK's defence secretary has also warned that we need to be prepared for a war. In his first major speech on defence, Grant Shapps said the country was moving from a ""post war to a pre-war world"".
He highlighted numerous threats, but there is one common thread amid all these warnings - Russia.
Germany's Defence Minister, Boris Pistorius, recently told a German newspaper ""we have to take into account that Vladimir Putin might even attack a Nato country one day"". While he said such an attack is unlikely now, ""our experts expect a period of five to eight years in which this could be possible"".
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has focussed the West's military minds.
As Gen Sir Patrick Sanders stated several times in his speech on Wednesday, ""Ukraine really matters"". Russia's ambitions, he said, were not just about seizing territory but ""about defeating our system and way of life politically, psychologically and symbolically"".
There is a sense in the upper echelons of the British military that many politicians and most of the public have not grasped the threat they see. It is the duty of the military to analyse that threat, and they still might be proved wrong. But European nations closer to Russian borders appear to be taking it more seriously.
Gen Sanders specifically mentioned Sweden. Earlier this month, its civil defence minister told a defence conference ""there could be a war in Sweden"". Carl-Oskar Bohlin asked the public ""have you considered whether you have time to join a voluntary defence organisation? If not - get moving!"" His remarks were backed up by the country's top military commander, who said Sweden should prepare itself mentally.
Some in the country criticised the remarks as alarmist. But others have responded by ""prepping for war"" - stocking food and fuel.
A number of European countries also rehearse for civil emergencies - with exercises that involve ordinary citizens as well as the military. It is often called total defence.
A number of northern European countries, including Sweden, already have a form of conscription for their armed forces.
Conscription requires young men and women to serve for a limited time in uniform. It means that some of the population will have had some military training  - and can then be assigned to reserve units should war break out.
In Sweden and Norway, conscription is partial - not everyone gets drafted. But it boosts the strength of the professional armed forces, which is often relatively small.
Finland, Nato's newest member and a country which has an 800-mile border with Russia, has wider conscription. Around 80% of the male population complete some form of military service. Refusal can mean a jail sentence, though there is the option of civilian service out of uniform too.
The overall effect means Finland can muster one of Europe's largest armies. The size of its active armed forces is only 19,000 personnel, but it can call on another 238,000 reserves.
In the UK, National Service - the country's old name for conscription- ended in 1960. There are no plans to bring it back.
Gen Sanders was not calling for conscription in his speech. He is a strong believer in a professional army made up of volunteers. But he was making the point that if war broke out troop numbers would be too small.
Cuts have already seen the size of the British Army fall from more than 100,000 in 2010 to around 73,000 now. Gen Sanders said that within the next three years the British Army needed to be 120,000 strong with the addition of reserves. But he said even that is not enough - so the Army should be designed to expand rapidly ""to enable the first echelon, resource the second echelon, and train and equip the citizen army that must follow"".
He added that: ""Ukraine brutally illustrates that regular armies start wars; citizen armies win them.""
So, what did he mean by a citizen army? He was not making a case for conscription or for an imminent call up of volunteers. Instead, he was urging Britain to prepare for a mass mobilisation of tens of thousands of people, should war break out. That would require planning and a change of mindset in government.
Downing Street does not seem keen - it said the general's hypothetical scenarios were not helpful.
Yet the Army is already looking at how it might create a citizens' army. One Whitehall source told the Times that the training of Ukrainian civilians on UK soil could act as a rehearsal for rapid Army expansion.
To train and equip that larger army would inevitably require more money. The government says it wants to spend 2.5% of national income on defence - but has still not said when.
Gen Sanders' speech was intended to be a wake-up call for the nation. But without political support, the mindset of a country that does not feel like it is about to go to war is unlikely to change.
One ex senior minister suggested to me that there was a generational divide between those who had lived with the threat of the Cold War era, and those who had not. The former minister, currently a serving Conservative MP, pointed out that the prime minister grew up without that existential threat.

A group of families of Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza have stormed a meeting at the Knesset, Israel's parliament.
They broke through security and interrupted a finance meeting - protesting that it was deliberating while their loved ones remain in captivity.

QEDERHY6PQ_8QZX2KYL6S5J1CS,Oxford's Headington Shark house Airbnb row deepens,By Dave Gilyeat,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-68083194,"The owner of a famous house with a shark sticking out of its roof has criticised a council refusing him permission to rent it out on Airbnb.
Magnus Hanson-Heine said the Headington Shark house was shown off by Oxford City Council in its local plan for the area but treated as ""just any other place"" when the decision was made.
""I would like them to leave the shark and me alone,"" he said.
Oxford City Council said the house was not in a site suitable for short lets.
The shark, which was controversial when it appeared in 1986, was added to the Oxford Heritage Asset Register in 2022, which recognises places of important local cultural, social or historic value.

Installed by former BBC Radio Oxford presenter Bill Heine, Untitled 1986 was a cause celebre at the time
Mr Hanson-Heine has been renting out the landmark property for several years, but received a breach notice from the council last July. He appealed but permission was refused.
""The change of use would result in the loss of a residential dwelling, in which the proposal would also fail to be regarded as meeting any of the exceptional circumstances,"" the council document says.
It sent out an enforcement notice in November, but Mr Hanson-Heine has appealed to the Planning Inspectorate.
He said: ""I think it's very telling that the Headington Local Plan of the council has the shark house on its cover page... and now they're essentially claiming it be treated like any other house with very glib one-line reasons why it shouldn't be given this permission, if permission is even needed, which isn't clear at all.""
He added: ""If I'm wrong on point of law, then I hope they really see that this is a truly unique offering for Oxfordshire and maybe England as a whole.
""It isn't something that should be treated just as any other place in their average plan. They don't do it whenever it suits them, and that's just wrong.""
Linda Smith, cabinet member for housing, said the ""uncontrolled rise in the number of short lets deprives our city of much-needed homes and can cause misery in quiet neighbourhoods"".
She added: ""The shark house is not in a location we consider suitable for short lets, which is why we have previously refused an application for change of use, and why we are now taking planning enforcement action against the property.""
Installed by former BBC Radio Oxford presenter Bill Heine and sculpted by John Buckley, the Headington Shark, known as Untitled 1986, was a cause celebre when it landed.
Heine, who died in 2019, was told it broke planning rules and he was only able to keep it when Michael Heseltine backed an appeal in 1992.

QHEDKHZLQV_8JCQTIEPABRB1R3,Could this warship return to the Clyde for good?,Ashleigh Keenan-Bryce,22 January 2024,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cmmprln3ldeo,"HMS Ambuscade was built on the Clyde in 1975
A former Royal Navy warship which served in the Falklands War looks set to return to the Clyde.
HMS Ambuscade was built at Yarrow shipyard in Glasgow in 1975 and was part of the Royal Navy's fleet until 1993 when it was sold to the Pakistan Navy.
In 2005, by which time it had been renamed PNS Tariq, it was used to rescue 377 tourists in the Maldives during the Indian Ocean tsunami.
Now a Glaswegian businessman has signed a deal with the Pakistan Navy to bring the ship back to Scotland, where it could become a floating museum.
David O'Neill hopes it can be permanently berthed at Greenock and he is in talks with Inverclyde Council about his plans.
David O'Neill signed the final transfer paperwork at the Pakistan High Commission in London at the end of 2023
He wants the ship to become a museum which would pay tribute to the Clyde shipbuilding industry, as well as giving the Pakistani community a cultural landmark in Scotland.
Mr O'Neill, who runs Falls of Clyde International (FOCI), told BBC Scotland News he secured the ship for free after making a cheeky request to the Pakistan Navy.
""I thought I would just be typical Glaswegian, tongue in cheek, and say: 'Listen mate, we'd love that ship but by the way, we've no money,'"" he said.
""That's exactly what I said to him.
""I wasn't very optimistic, I really wasn't. Then in December 2021, just before Christmas, Commodore Jamal Alam contacted me and said: 'I've got some very good news, our government said yes.'""
HMS Ambuscade had all distinguishing marks removed during the Falklands War
The UK High Commissioner of Pakistan, Dr Muhammad Faisal, said he was delighted that the Pakistan Navy signed the agreement on 25 September 2023.
""Donation of this ship to FOCI will continue to symbolise the shared maritime heritage of the Pakistan Navy and the Royal Navy,"" he said.
""After its arrival at Glasgow, it will be seen as a tribute to the long-standing shared heritage of both navies.
""The ship will also serve as a remembrance for Pakistani diaspora and veterans of PNS Tariq/HMS Ambuscade.â
Mr O'Neill is now making plans to transport the ship from its berth in Karachi, Pakistan to Glasgow.
""The company we're looking towards are going to supply a semi-submersible lift ship,"" he explained
""That's a vessel that sinks down in the water, a door at the end is opened up, our ship is brought inside, the door is closed and the water pumped out.
""Then the ship rises again. That's the safest way to get the ship home.""
HMS Ambuscade had her final white ensign removed in July 1993 in an official handover service to the Pakistan Naval Service
Before leaving Karachi, the local community will be given a final opportunity to say farewell to the ship at a formal reception.
Tributes are also planned along its route as it returns to Scotland.
Mr O'Neill, who has a background in radio communications and other heritage projects, has grand plans to welcome the ship back to the Clyde.
He said: ""We're still engaging with the Royal Navy and the Pakistan Navy to see whether they would consider sending a warship to escort her back up the Clyde.
""But equally, we have been reaching out to any boat and yacht clubs and we're going to be appealing for a flotilla to welcome her back to the Clyde where she was built.""
Plans show the proposed location of HMS Ambuscade/PNS Tariq on the river Clyde in Greenock, next to the Beacon Arts Centre
Once it has safely returned to the Clyde, the future of the ship and its long term sustainability is ""the biggest part"" of what Mr O'Neill is looking to achieve.
He hopes to berth the ship next to the Beacon Arts Centre in Greenock.
""We came up with this idea that if we could get this ship back to the UK we could make it not only a Royal Navy exhibit but also a joint cultural exhibit for the first time,"" he added.
""The Pakistani community across Europe will be able to come to Scotland and stand on a piece of Pakistan and feel at home.
""It will give a centre of focus for Pakistani arts, music, food, business that can all have access to the site and be as proud of it as we are of the HMS Ambuscade days.""
Inverclyde Council described plans for the ship as an ""exciting idea""
The ship served with the Royal Navy until the 1990s
A spokesperson for Inverclyde Council described Mr O'Neill's plans as an ""exciting idea"" and confirmed they had met him to find out more.
âClearly with a proposed project of this magnitude there are lots of matters that need addressed, including engagement with stakeholders such as the port authority and the planning service, and there needs to be a full business case and financial plan in place,"" they added.
âHowever, we have agreed to meet with Mr OâNeill in the new year to find out about the progress being made by his group and to see if there is anything else we can do to support.â
It's not the first time Mr O'Neill has tried to bring a Clyde-built ship back to Scotland.
In 2021 he founded FOCI in a bid to save a tall ship from being scuttled (deliberately sunk) in Hawaii.
The ship - Falls of Clyde - had been built in Port Glasgow but legal complications and the pandemic put his plans on hold.

QN6VL8FS59_DUN9OIFVT4A1XG4,Chief whip issues warning to Tory MPs who rebelled on Rwanda,By Chris Mason,7 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68054528,"The 11 Conservative MPs who defied the prime minister over his Rwanda migrant plan last week are being called in by the government to explain themselves.
The Tory backbenchers, including the former Home Secretary Suella Braverman and the former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, are expected to meet the government's Chief Whip Simon Hart later.
Mr Hart, whose job it is to ensure the government wins votes in the House of Commons, will meet the MPs one-on-one, having been asked to do so by the prime minister.
Senior government figures say the meetings, which are often standard practice after a high-profile rebellion, are ""about sending a message that rebelling is not going to be tolerated going forward"".
They are also about the government attempting to illustrate its power, after a week in which the power, authority and judgement of Rishi Sunak was repeatedly and noisily questioned by plenty on his own side.
The threat, that rebelling is ""not going to be tolerated"", is vague and meant to be so. It can be read as a final warning, that behaving in a similar way again might lead MPs to be thrown out of the parliamentary party.
But it doesn't commit No 10 to doing this.
Some of the rebels, for their part, reckon Mr Sunak is too weak to do this and doing so would provoke further turbulence in the party, the very thing he is desperate to avoid.
The government's Rwanda policy will be debated in the House of Lords later.
Peers will look at a report published last week by the International Agreements Committee, which implies a further delay to the policy necessary.
The committee is chaired by the former Labour Attorney General Lord Goldsmith.
Boris Johnson's former chief of staff in Downing Street, the Conservative peer Lord Udny-Lister, is also on the committee.
And here is the committee's key conclusion: ""The government has presented the Rwanda Treaty to Parliament as an answer to the Supreme Court judgment and has asked Parliament, on the basis of the treaty, to declare that Rwanda is a safe country.
""While the treaty might in time provide the basis for such an assessment if it is rigorously implemented, as things stand the arrangements it provides for are incomplete. A significant number of further legal and practical steps are required under the treaty which will take time.""
We haven't heard the last of the debates about sending some asylum seekers to Rwanda.
And we haven't heard the last of those at Westminster who aren't convinced the government's plans can, or should, work.

QOWB88T6XU_HMI619JXOT9XKTC,Coltan discovered in Kenya - Mining Minister Salim Mvurya,By Gloria Aradi,4 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-68090482,"Kenya has discovered its first deposits of the valuable mineral coltan, the mining minister has said.
The rare mineral is used to manufacture electric car batteries, mobile phones and other electronic devices.
The Democratic Republic of Congo holds more than 70% of the world's coltan reserves, which have for decades fuelled violent conflict in the east of the country.
It is not clear how large the coltan deposits found in Kenya are.
Mining officials have previously hinted that Kenya could have traces of the highly valuable ore, but Kenya's Minister for Mining, Blue Economy and Maritime Affairs Salim Mvurya on Wednesday said that his announcement means ""it is now official"" that Kenya has coltan reserves.
Deposits of the mineral have been found in six counties across the country, but their value is yet to be determined.
""We will leave our teams behind to do ground truthing so that we can now begin to assess the economic value of that particular mineral,"" Mr Mvurya said.
Residents of Embu County in eastern Kenya, one of the six counties with reserves of the mineral, have been advised to hold onto their land.
""A precious mineral has been found here and if you want to benefit you should not sell your land,"" Nebart Muriuki, an MP from the county, was quoted as saying by the privately owned East African newspaper.
Mr Mvurya said the discovery was expected to create more jobs and expand Kenya's mining industry.
Mining accounts for less than 1% of Kenya's GDP but has the potential to contribute up to 10%, according to the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI).
Coltan is often refined into metallic tantalum, a heat-resistant powder that is used to produce capacitors, which are then used to manufacture electronic devices.
The price of coltan depends on how much tantalum it contains, but on average, a kilogram of the rare ore fetches $48 (Â£37), according to Forbes.
Analysts say the international demand for coltan is growing fast and has become one of the driving forces behind the conflict in eastern DR Congo, as rival militias fight for control of mines that produce coltan and other valuable minerals.
DR Congo, along with neighbouring Rwanda, are two of the world's top coltan suppliers."
QTE3ODT6XC_DI8AN915A9AC81Y,New Hampshire primary: Nikki Haley vows to fight on after second loss to Trump,By Holly Honderich,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68077998,"Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley has vowed to press on with her campaign in the wake of a second consecutive loss to Donald Trump.
Ms Haley campaigned across New Hampshire ahead of Tuesday's primary, courting both independent and moderate Republican voters.
But she was unable to catch Mr Trump, who had a comfortable 11-point lead with most ballots counted.
He now appears set to clinch the Republican nomination.
The former president last week won a landslide in Iowa's caucuses, with Ms Haley placing third, behind Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.
Mr DeSantis quit the race days later, leaving Ms Haley as the last remaining rival to Mr Trump.
At an election night party in Concord on Tuesday night, Ms Haley conceded the New Hampshire contest, congratulating Mr Trump on his win.
But she vowed to take her bid to become the Republican party's presidential candidate back home to South Carolina, the state where she served as governor, in a month's time.
""This race is far from over,"" Ms Haley said to a boisterous room of supporters. ""There are dozens of states left to go. And the next one is my sweet state of South Carolina.""

Watch: Trump lashes out at 'imposter' Haley in victory speech
Even with her close ties to the state, opinion polls suggest Ms Haley is trailing Mr Trump by a wide margin.
Mr Trump did not seem to take well to Ms Haley's speech on Tuesday, calling her ""delusional"".
""Who the hell was that imposter that went up on that stage that went before and claimed victory?"" he said.
Team Haley hit back almost immediately, describing his speech as a ""furious and rumbling rant"".
For months, Ms Haley remained cautious in her criticism of Mr Trump, the prohibitive frontrunner and her former boss. But in New Hampshire last weekend, the former UN ambassador made her most pointed attacks to date, warning of his friendships with ""dictators"", questioning his mental acuity and slamming his ""lies"".
Exit polls from CBS News, the BBC's US partner, showed her 11th-hour sprint may have paid off - two-thirds of voters who made their decision in the last few days voted for her. And Ms Haley outperformed opinion polls that had shown her trailing Mr Trump by around 20 points.
Still, despite the state's sizable bloc of independent voters - those who were considered likely to favour Ms Haley - she could not fully close the considerable ground between herself and the former president.
""Nikki put in the time, put in the work and put in the money,"" said Katon Dawson, a Haley surrogate and the former chairman of the South Carolina Republican party. ""With that said, Donald Trump is an 800 pound gorilla that has his arms around the base.""
Across New Hampshire ahead of the primary, some members of that base told the BBC they thought Ms Haley was insufficiently conservative. Others said they liked her personally, but that they would not waver in their support for Mr Trump.
""I'm not sure about some of her policies,"" said Pat Hansen on Tuesday in Manchester. And it reflected poorly on Ms Haley, she believed, that top Republicans in South Carolina had turned their backs on her and endorsed Mr Trump.
Ms Haley is opting out of the third Republican contest - caucuses in Nevada - and experts said a loss in South Carolina's primary on 24 February would likely be fatal to her campaign.
""The momentum is moving toward Trump rapidly and he's likely going to close the nomination early,"" said veteran Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. ""There's little doubt now.""
And there's this daunting piece of political trivia for Ms Haley: no Republican candidate has ever won the first two states and not gone on to become the Republican nominee.

QWGYLYESWW_9Y2QE1VU7SVNJZQ,'Bankrupt' Nottingham City Council seeks Â£65m of emergency help,By Jamie Waller,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-68062038,"Nottingham City Council has asked the government for Â£65m of ""exceptional financial support"".
The authority effectively declared itself bankrupt in November when it issued a section 114 notice.
It faces a Â£23m budget shortfall for the current financial year, and a separate Â£53m gap for the year beginning April 2024.
The council has asked the government for the emergency help for both financial years.
It has asked the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) for Â£25m this financial year and up to Â£40m next year.
Details of the application for funding were revealed in a presentation at a council meeting on Monday.
The Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) said the council officials believe the funding will only be provided if the authority implements the full Â£14.9m its is proposing in cuts - including those to libraries, road sweeping and community protection.
The LDRS also said any support would likely be in the form of loans and special permission to raise money from council assets and spend it on day-to-day operational costs, rather than a grant.
Steve Battlemuch, the council's portfolio holder for skills, growth, economic development and property, said the authority was waiting for a government response.
He said: ""We do need an answer sooner rather than later. The budget is due in February.
""There are a number of factors to be confirmed which we can't finalise until we get an answer.
""The implication from government is that the council will only get money if we accept all of the proposed cuts.""
The government is currently reviewing all steps the council is taking to close its budget gap and previously said it is ""minded-to"" appoint commissioners to take charge.
The DLUHC has been contacted for comment.

R0F1PVMQF0_F99D5XPXEOARNMD,Bath University makes students resit exam after giving answers,By Clara Bullock & Lee Madan,6 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-68056937,"A university accidentally printed the answers on one of their exams and students are now protesting the exam's resit date.
The University of Bath handed out the answers and marking scheme to an exam.
Now more than 400 economics students have to resit, causing problems for international students who were planning to fly home at the time of the new exam date.
The university told BBC Points West that they are ""very sorry"".
A student, who wanted to remain anonymous, said he was initially ""confused"" when he saw the exam papers included the answers.
""I just continued with the exam and used the marking scheme as help towards my answer,"" he said.
""I thought - who on earth managed to do this? I was quite angry, too. It was chaos.""
The exam went ahead with the answers, without any further communication during the exam, the student added.
It was only on the next day that they found out there would be a resit date.
""The majority of us were upset with what the resit date was. We started submitting formal complaints,"" the student said.
More than 150 students have so far signed a petition, asking the university to reconsider the resit date, which is on Friday.
They say international students have already booked flights home during that date, assuming they would be done with exams by then.
They also say the stress of preparing for a second exam is ""unfair"".
""I think the university needs to understand the stress and anxiety, performances are definitely going to fall,"" the student said.
""I feel like I will get less marks than I am capable of.
""This isn't a small mistake they can brush under the carpet, they need to take responsibility.""
In a statement the University of Bath said: ""Events like this are rare. We are taking steps to make sure it does not happen again.

R36GI6T7OR_G7BBBB0RM7XNTNZ,Kenneth Eugene Smith: US inmate faces first nitrogen execution after losing last-minute appeals,By Brandon Drenon & Tom Bateman,3 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68089279,"The Supreme Court has refused to grant a last-minute reprieve to an Alabama death row inmate facing the first ever US execution by nitrogen inhalation.
The justices have twice declined, along with a federal appeals court, to block what Kenneth Eugene Smith's lawyers call a ""cruel and unusual"" punishment.
Opponents say using nitrogen gas could cause unnecessary suffering, and a leak could harm people present in the room.
Smith, 58, was convicted in 1989 of murdering Elizabeth Sennett.
Alabama's death warrant expires early on Friday morning.
Smith, who has been on death row since 1996, told the BBC earlier this week that the wait felt like torture.
He will be the first person to be put to death by this method in the US and, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, anywhere in the world.
Breathing pure nitrogen without oxygen causes the cells to break down and leads to death. Alabama said in a court filing that they expect him to lose consciousness within seconds and die in a matter of minutes.
But its use has been denounced by some medical professionals, who warn it could cause a range of catastrophic mishaps, ranging from violent convulsions to survival in a vegetative state.
Alabama and two other US states have approved the use of nitrogen hypoxia as an alternative method of execution because the drugs used in lethal injections have become more difficult to find, contributing to a fall in the number of executions nationally.
Alabama already tried to execute Smith by lethal injection two years ago but were unable to raise a vein before the state's death warrant expired.
Smith was one of two men convicted of murdering Mrs Sennett in a $1,000 (Â£790) killing-for-hire in  March 1988.
The 45-year-old was beaten with a fireplace implement and stabbed in the chest and neck, and her death was staged to look like a home invasion and burglary.
Her husband Charles Sennett, a debt-ridden preacher, had orchestrated the scheme to collect insurance money. He killed himself as investigators closed in.
Smith's fellow hitman, John Forrest Parker, was executed in 2010.
At his trial Smith admitted to being present when the victim was killed, but said he did not take part in the attack.
The UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights has said gassing Smith could amount to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and called for a halt.
Smith's lawyers lodged a challenge with the Supreme Court, arguing that putting convicts through multiple execution attempts violates the Eighth Amendment of the US Constitution, which protects against ""cruel and unusual"" punishment.
On Wednesday, the justices declined to hear the appeal and denied his request to halt the execution. No justice publicly dissented from the ruling.
Smith also made a separate legal challenge to the lower 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals, where he contested the legality of Alabama's nitrogen gas protocol.
But that court also rejected the inmate's request for an injunction in a ruling on Wednesday evening.
A final appeal to the Supreme Court was rejected again on Thursday, with three liberal justices noting public dissents this time.
Smith's legal team argues the nitrogen gas method is ""recently released and untested"", leaving him at risk of choking on his own vomit.
State Attorney General Steve Marshall previously called it ""perhaps the most humane method of execution ever devised"".
Smith's spiritual adviser, Reverend Jeff Hood, will be present in the room when the execution happens. He told the BBC he believes he will be in danger if the nitrogen leaks.
On Wednesday, prison officials escorted Rev Hood for a ""walk-through"" of the execution chamber, as required by Alabama's execution protocol.
He told the BBC afterwards that he saw oxygen-level meters unplugged on a ledge inside the room, which he described as ""unbelievably disturbing, it feels like you are at the centre of evil"".
""I asked 'what's the safety plan?' and they said they didn't want to get into it, they couldn't get into it,"" he said.

Watch: ""This is dangerous."" Smith's spiritual adviser, Jeff Hood, discusses the risk he faces.
""Once again we're back at this place of having to rely on these people who have botched three executions in the last [few] years, he said. ""It's absolutely a terrifying thing to think that your life hangs in the balance with these guys"".
Rev Hood said he had requested that Alabama's Governor Kay Ivey be present in the chamber during the execution to demonstrate her confidence in its safety, but had not received a response.
""We have somebody who is championing this type of execution in the governor and yet she is unwilling to get her hands dirty,"" he said.
The BBC has approached Ms Ivey's office for comment regarding this and the latest accusations over safety.
Alabama has one of the highest per capita execution rates in the US and has 165 people currently on death row.
Since 2018, the state has been responsible for three botched attempts at lethal injection in which the condemned inmates survived.
The failures led to an internal review that largely placed blame on the prisoners themselves.

R8GE73JEM3_KCE4JC5IEZ1LZSH,Mongolia: Three dead after liquified natural gas tanker crashes,By Flora Drury,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-68079262,"Three firefighters have died after a truck carrying 60 tons of liquefied natural gas crashed and exploded in the Mongolian capital.
Hundreds of firefighters had been sent to battle the blaze following the collision with a car in Ulaanbaatar on Wednesday morning, officials said.
At least 11 people were injured, with the fire spreading to nearby buildings.
One local resident described how he initially thought a plane had crashed.
Erdenebold Sukhbaatar, a 40-year-old lawyer, told Reuters news agency the crash, which took place just after 01:00 local time (17:00 GMT on Tuesday), had felt like an earthquake, but was followed by a bright light.
""It was very strong. And then I've never seen such kind of, like, strong [explosion]. It was like 60, you know, tons, which means 60,000, litres [of gas] you know. It was like huge liquid gas.""
He watched the ensuing fire spread to ""almost three different buildings"", climbing at speed.
One resident told Reuters that by the time they realised their building was alight, their front door had already been engulfed in flames, forcing them to break out of the back door. When they looked back, the fire had reached the top floor of the building.
""It all happened very quickly,"" they said.
Another described how the force of the explosion had not only blown out their windows, but also destroyed their balcony.
According to Sainbuyan Amarsaikhan, Mongolia's deputy prime minister, no casualties had been reported from inside any of the buildings.
However, he revealed the firefighters - named as Barsuren Davaajav, Amgalanbayar Shirneng, and Tuvshintur Erdenedavaa - died in a second explosion, which threw part of the truck ""with a lot of force"", resulting in the ""tragic loss"" of life.
The Mongolian National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) - which said the fire was put out by 04:30 - added that four children were among the injured, including one who was being treated for poisoning.
Questions are now being asked about why a tank carrying such a dangerous load had been allowed to travel into the residential neighbourhood, containing many schools.
""You know, if it happened [in] the daylight time, especially during the rush hours in the morning or in the evening, [it would] be more harmful,"" Erdenebold Sukhbaatar pointed out.
""This shows city planning is really bad,"" Ankhbayar Galbadrakh told AFP news agency. ""All of these trucks - with gas or without gas - should travel outside of the city limit.""

A row over cattle sparked the violence in Plateau state, where there are fraught ethnic and religious tensions.
One man in Mangu town told the BBC how his 63-year-old brother had been killed in his home, which was then set ablaze.
""As I speak to you, his six children are still crying. We have just buried him with another 14 bodies,"" he said.
Plateau is where Nigeria's mainly Muslim north meets the largely Christian south and many communities are mixed.
Residents of Mangu, which is 74km (45 miles) south-east of the state capital, Jos, are mainly from the Muslim Fulani and Christian Mwagaful ethnic groups
Fulani businessman Umar Haruna was at home when the trouble erupted on Tuesday afternoon, his brother Abdullahi Haruna said.
He lived in an area of the town where both ethnic groups reside - and where now 100 houses have been burnt down, he said.
Seven mosques and four churches have also been destroyed, Mr Haruna said.
Umar Haruna's wife and children were not at home when the house was attacked. They only returned on Wednesday.
""When we went to the house, his body was burnt just as the house. We couldn't even give him the usual Muslim corpse bath due to the fact that the body was damaged badly,"" the brother said.
Dagen Emmanuel Bello, an ethnic Magwaful, said he seen dead bodies on the streets and buildings burnt.
""There are some people who were killed and their bodies hidden, so we are still trying to search for them at the moment,"" he told BBC Hausa.
The violence began after cattle belonging to Fulani residents escaped on to a road angering some in the Mwagaful community. A 24-hour curfew was then imposed but did not stop further violence on Wednesday.
People in the area said soldiers were deployed to Mangu but stayed on the main roads and did not intervene in the suburbs where the tit-for-tat revenge attacks continued.
More than 100 people lost their lives in similar violence in another part of Plateau state over Christmas.

RFNRZGSSFK_EYRTUAQILB518RS,Nottingham attacks: Victims' families condemn 'savage' killer,By Dan Martin & PA Media,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-68074779,"The loved ones of three people stabbed to death in Nottingham have faced their killer in court.
Valdo Calocane fatally attacked students Grace O'Malley-Kumar, Barnaby Webber and school caretaker Ian Coates on 13 June.
His pleas of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility were accepted by prosecutors in a court hearing on Tuesday.
The families of all three victims condemned Calocane in court.
The court heard Calocane approached University of Nottingham students Ms O'Malley-Kumar and Mr Webber, both 19, in Ilkeston Road as they walked home from a night out in the early hours.
The 32-year-old stabbed Mr Webber and then turned on Ms O'Malley-Kumar when she tried to protect her friend.
Shortly afterwards the defendant went on to stab Mr Coates, 65, in a separate attack in Magdala Road, and stole his van, which he later drove at three pedestrians.
Addressing Calocane, Ms O'Malley's father Dr Sanjoy Kumar said: ""Picking on children and the elderly is a cowardly and unforgivable act.
""And your acts of cowardice should be highlighted to the world.""
Praising his daughter, Dr Kumar added: ""She bravely intervened. She would never leave a friend in adversity. It was not in her nature.
""She heroically and valiantly fought you. Like a hero she put herself in harm's way.
""But unfortunately because of the weapon you carried she stood no chance.
""You showed yourself to be a cold, cowardly and calculating killer. You casually walked away, leaving my child lying in the street.""
Calocane had denied murder but admitted manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility with the court hearing he had a long history of mental health problems.
Dr Kumar told the court the impact of losing his daughter had been ""utterly devastating for our whole family and friends"".
He added: ""The manner in which Grace lost her life has multiplied the magnitude of our pain.
""Grace was a kind, warm and generous person. She was the friend you would want. She hated exclusion of others and always tried her best to defend the lonely.
""When she decided she would study medicine, I was so proud.""
Ms O'Malley-Kumar's mother, Sinead O'Malley, told the court her ""darling girl"" had been ""cruelly and violently taken away from us"" by Calocane.
Addressing Calocane directly, she said: ""You are responsible for our ongoing pain and heartbreak.
""You are duplicitous and manipulative. You have shown no remorse.
""You understood right from wrong. You have violence in your soul.
""You are medically non-compliant and are never to be trusted. You remain a danger to society and the wider public.
""We know justice will be served. The public needs to be protected from you.""

Barnaby Webber's father David said the ""waves"" of pain he had experienced since his eldest son's death had been ""crippling"" as he branded Calocane a ""monster"".
He said: ""Barnaby was a vibrant, loving boy who was growing into a man and starting to live his best life.
""As a father I dreaded him leaving home [to go to university] but I loved my visits to see him; he always had a smile to welcome me.
""Due to your unbelievably savage actions I will never get that again.""
Mr Webber's mother Emma told Calocane he was a ""monstrous individual"".
She said: ""Barney didn't lose his life on 13 June. It was stolen from him in the most vicious, unprovoked, senseless and evil way imaginable.
""There must be appropriate justice served and punishment for the actions of this one monstrous individual.""
Mrs Webber said she had been ""terrified"" before viewing his body in a hospital chapel of rest, but added: ""But I am glad I did and he had the final kiss of his forehead from me.
""However, it's something that no parent should ever have to do.""
Ian Coates's son James Coates said his father was just five months away from retirement before he was killed.
He said: ""You can't imagine how hard it is to take the phone call that their dad has been murdered in a killing spree.
""To have a life taken so horrifically is something you will never come to terms with. The effect this has had on us cannot be put into words.
""The reason for our very existence, gone.""
Calocane, who answered to the name Adam Mendes in court, also admitted attempting to murder the three pedestrians he hit with a van.
His barrister Peter Joyce KC told a previous hearing the defendant ""does not dispute the physical facts of the prosecution's case"" but was suffering from ""extreme"" mental illness at the time of the incident.

RN4LXJ8U6C_0OKG891C088NPS3,"Bullying 'normal occurrence' at Newcastle NHS trust, say CQC",_,5 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-68070441,"A ""significant deterioration"" in leadership at an NHS trust probably had a ""knock-on effect"" on its standard of services, a watchdog has found.
Inspectors found staff felt encouraged to ""turn a blind eye"" to bullying in hospitals run by the Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.
The Care Quality Commission (CQC) downgraded the trust's overall rating to ""requires improvement"".
The trust said it ""fully accepts"" the report.
Bosses at Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said recommendations were being worked on ""as a matter of urgency"".
Inspections were carried out between June and September in surgery, services for children and young people, and medical care at the Freeman Hospital and the Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI), as well as maternity services and urgent and emergency care at the RVI.
The trust's patient transport service (known as NECTAR) was also inspected.
A report released on Wednesday saw its overall rating decline from ""outstanding"", which it was awarded in 2019, to ""requires improvement"".
How ""well-led"" the trust was declined from ""outstanding"" to ""inadequate"".
""Safety"" dropped from ""good"" to ""requires improvement"", ""effective and responsive"" declined from ""outstanding"" to requires ""improvement"", while ""caring"" dropped from ""outstanding"" to ""good"".
Ann Ford, CQC's director of operations in the north, said: ""We found a significant deterioration in how well the trust was being led.
""Our experience tells us that when a trust isn't well led, this has a knock-on effect on the standard of services being provided to people.
""Some staff told us that bullying was a normal occurrence, and they were encouraged to 'turn a blind eye' and not report this behaviour.
""This is completely unacceptable.""
Since the inspection, a new chief executive and other senior leaders have joined the trust.
The CQC said they will continue to monitor the trust and will return to carry out another inspection.
Analysis by Sharon Barbour, BBC Look North Health Correspondent
For years Newcastle Hospitals proudly displayed its ""outstanding"" rating.  The Freeman is world-renowned for its cardiac work, and the RVI was the first to treat Covid patients in the UK.
Behind the scenes, however, serious problems were brewing - particularly in the cardiac surgery unit, which is where the CQC began to focus its attention.
Whistleblowers reported bullying, some around safety concerns, and there were claims and counter claims. It is the leadership which has come in for the harshest criticism, and not only because of failings in managing the cardiothoracic unit.
Now there is new boss, Sir Jim Mackey. His priority is changing the culture.
He's also planning to sort IT issues, which meant thousands of clinical letters to GPs were not sent out.
Newcastle Hospitals is not the only trust struggling to keep hold of fine ratings. Covid, strike action, A&E delays, staffing, funding and social care shortages are all leaving trust bosses with a lot to fix.
The report is very bad news for staff - but the rating for caring, well that was ""good"".
Newcastle Hospitals' new chief executive, Sir James Mackey, said: ""We fully accept the CQC's reports.
""Their clear recommendations for attention and improvement are being worked on as a matter of urgency and I am confident we can fix this by working together across the organisation and focussing on what matters to patients and staff.""
The trust said they have put in an improvement programme, which included having an ""open and honest"" incident reporting system.
A further targeted inspection took place in the cardiothoracic surgery department at the Freeman Hospital in September, in response to concerns raised by whistleblowers regarding the culture, specifically about bullying and harassment and safety concerns.
The watchdog said trainees felt the atmosphere in theatres was ""toxic"" and ""disrespectful of them, and others"".
No new rating came from that inspection, but the trust has since updated their action plan to include specific actions in relation to culture, the CQC said.

RPSA68GAQZ_GOCIC019OJ7Y7II,Covid: Mark Drakeford says he did not delete phone messages,By Shelley Phelps and David Deans,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-68100946,"Wales' first minister Mark Drakeford says he has not deleted messages during the pandemic from his phone.
Last week the Covid inquiry heard that former Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon has removed all of her Covid-era WhatsApp messages.
Mr Drakeford previously said ministers or officials may have deleted messages.
Wales' decision making in the pandemic will be scrutinised when the Covid inquiry visits Cardiff in February and March.
Mr Drakeford said he used ""electronic means of communicating... very little"" during the pandemic.
On Thursday the inquiry heard that Ms Sturgeon had called former prime minister Boris Johnson a ""clown"" in an expletive-laden text message.
Asked if any of the messages he has given to the inquiry would be of a similar tone to Nicola Sturgeon, Mr Drakeford said: ""I was a very sparing user of electronic ways of communicating, I used them very little and only generally when I simply needed to tell somebody, for example, that a meeting was about to start.
""So I'm afraid there's likely to be very little interest in the few messages that have been sent to the inquiry.""
Asked whether he or his ministers had deleted messages, Mr Drakeford said: ""I can't speak for everybody because, as we've now learnt, different people's phones had different settings on them and things were happening without people even necessarily knowing that that was going on.
""I don't think there's anything deleted on my phone but there wasn't much to start with.""
Mr Drakeford had to correct the Senedd record late last year after he told the Welsh Parliament he did not use the WhatsApp messaging system.
A week later he admitted to the Senedd that he did, although he said he did not use it regularly.

S8CAYZYA18_8CDWZ21ERYIFDKG,China appears to U-turn on 'obsessive' gaming crackdown,By Imran Rahman-Jones,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68068440,"China seems to have backtracked on strict rules to combat what the regulator deemed ""obsessive"" gaming.
The National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA) had proposed regulations limiting the amount of money and time people spent playing video games.
However, on Tuesday the draft rules were no longer on the NPPA website.
China is the world's biggest online gaming market, but the industry has had frequent run-ins with the authorities.
The new rules would have limited in-game purchases. Incentives such as daily log-in rewards for gamers would also have come under fire, while the introduction of a pop-up warning players of ""irrational"" behaviour was proposed.
Share prices of Chinese gaming firms - including the world's biggest gaming company Tencent Holdings and its rival NetEase - jumped after the apparent U-turn.
They had plummeted after the rules were first proposed in December, wiping nearly $80bn (Â£63bn) off the value of the two companies.
However, analysts say the sector is still clouded by uncertainty about what the government might do next.
""I think this type of sentiment will probably last for quite some time, unless we get a very drastic turnaround in government rhetoric, or unless we get some super supportive policies,"" said Ivan Su, senior analyst at Morningstar.
""We don't know if it's going to happen in a week, in a couple months, or in a couple of years.""
China's largest crackdown on gamers came in 2021 when children were banned from playing for more than an hour on certain days.
That same year, the government stopped gaming licences from being granted for eight months.
As a result, says Mr Su, ""a lot of Chinese developers have started shifting their development pipeline toward overseas games"".
NetEase and Tencent acquired or invested in companies in the likes of France, Japan and the United States.
It remains to be seen whether the current uncertainty will prompt another wave of overseas expansion.

S8Z3LC9XU2_U24VTNOWXLX6DUX,NHS consultants reject latest pay offer,By Nick Triggle,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-68098189,"Consultants have rejected the latest pay offer from the government in England - by the narrowest of margins.
The British Medical Association urged ministers to better the deal, after 51% voted against it, with a 65% turnout.
The deal offered was worth an extra 4.95%, on average, in basic pay from this month - and would have come on top of the 6% rise granted in April.
Health Secretary Victoria Atkins said she was disappointed the ""fair and reasonable"" offer had been rejected.
""The government is carefully considering the next steps,"" she added.
Consultants staged four walkouts last year. They have a strike mandate until June but have yet to announce further action.
Those at the much smaller Hospital Consultants and Specialists Union also rejected the deal.
The amount individual doctors would have received, on top of the 6% rise already granted, would have varied from 0% to nearly 13%, as part of an overhaul of their contracts.
Nurses and other health workers ended their strike action after receiving a 5% rise and a one-off payment of Â£1,655.
And when the offer to consultants was made, last month, the Royal College of Nursing called it ""galling"".
BMA consultants leader Dr Vishal Sharma said: ""The vote has shown that consultants do not feel the current offer goes far enough to end the current dispute and offer a long-term solution.
""It backs up conversations we've had with colleagues in recent weeks, who felt the changes were insufficient and did not give them confidence that pay erosion would be addressed over the coming years.
""In addition, they were concerned about the fairness of the offer and how it impacted different groups of doctors.
""There were also clear concerns about changes to professional development time, and time dedicated to teaching and research.
""However, with the result so close, the consultants committee is giving the government a chance to improve the offer.""
The contract changes linked to the offer included:
The BMA had also agreed to stop pushing for premium rates of up to Â£269-an-hour for consultants to work overtime.
But the union's leadership then said the deal varied so much, depending on what stage of their career a doctor was at, it had been impossible to give a blanket recommendation.
Consultants had originally asked for an above-inflation pay rise this year - a figure above 11% had been floated - and a commitment to start restoring pay in future years.
Since 2008, pay levels had fallen significantly, once inflation was taken into account, the BMA had said.
Meanwhile, the BMA has announced junior doctors will be balloted to extend their strike mandate, which ends in February.
Talks with the government broke down in early December, prompting walkouts before Christmas and in the first week of January.

The supermarket chain has 300 forecourts attached to superstores with half of those already unmanned.
Another 82 are to go cash-free, with 14 already having been converted since December last year, according to the supermarket.
It said all of its workers at the sites would be redeployed by this summer.
Only forecourts adjacent to Asda superstores will be affected, the supermarket chain added.
An Asda spokesperson said the changes were being made as more than nine in 10 payments made at superstore forecourts were made via card or contactless device.
It added: ""The colleagues who worked on these sites are moving into the store so they can better serve our customers"".
The supermarket said conversions had begun in December, with the changeover expected to complete ""later in 2024"".
There have been calls for the Prime Minister to replicate new legislation in Ireland that will force businesses to accept cash.
Supermarkets, pharmacies and corner shops will have to accept physical cash under rules signed off by politicians in Ireland on Tuesday.
Other types of shops and retailers are exempt, with the rules expected to come into effect later this year.
There are indications that cash use is on the rise, with the British Retail Consortium (BRC) reporting recently that cash purchases had grown in 2022 for the first time in 10 years.
It said shoppers were keeping a close eye on their budgets while prices rise, echoing a report by banks showing a slight rebound.
Cash was used in 19% of transactions in 2022, according to the BRC, up from 15% the previous year.

The gang, including one person reportedly armed with a gun, threatened people in several premises in Dungiven, County Londonderry, on Friday evening.
The first incident happened at St Canice's GAC on Friday evening.
In a statement, the club's management team said it was ""extremely angry and shocked"" by what happened.
The club stands against any form of criminality and would not tolerate any such activity at its premises, it added.
""This type of threat by masked men entering our premises is deplorable and of days gone by,"" the statement said.
""There is no need for this type of behaviour in a society that's looking to move beyond what happened in our past.""
Police said they received reports that the masked gang also went to four local bars in Dungiven sometime between 19:15 and 19:20, ""claiming to represent the IRA, and threatened people inside"".
""We know that the bars were heavily populated and detectives are keen to speak with anyone who was in any of the bars at the time,"" police added.

SE0UE49JM5_HOUSSC87CRDES0V,"Cancer patient went year without check-up, inquest told",By Nathan Bevan,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-68109597,"A prostate cancer patient went a year without a check-up because his referral to a consultant was lost.
An inquest into the death of Thomas Ithell also heard that when the error was spotted it was not recorded because staff at Wrexham Maelor Hospital were too busy.
The 77-year-old from Wrexham died in November 2022 after being admitted to hospital with shortness of breath.
Betsi Cadwaladr health board offered its condolences to Mr Ithell's family.
However, Assistant Coroner for North Wales East and Central Kate Robertson expressed concern that no investigation took place.
She has now submitted a Prevention of Future Deaths report to the health board in relation to Mr Ithell's case.
As well as concerns over the lack of an investigation, she also questioned how the patient's follow-up appointment was missed.
""There have been no assurances as to what, if any, changes and learning have been identified other than a tracking system for PSA monitoring,"" she wrote, referring to a type of blood test that helps diagnose prostate cancer.
She was also concerned to learn that the hospital's Datix system - used for reporting incidents such as Mr Ithell's - had been described as ""not user-friendly"".
Time constraints also sometimes prevented staff from completing these reports, thereby failing to trigger subsequent investigations by the board, the assistant coroner added.
""I remain incredibly concerned that where matters are not raised in accordance with internal health board processes that assurances given to me in previous Prevention of Future Deaths reports cannot be supported,"" Ms Robertson added.
Thomas Ithell was first diagnosed in September 2017 and had radiotherapy and hormone deprivation treatment.
However, he did not tolerate the hormone treatment well and was reluctant to continue with it.
His PSA levels were not tested after November 2021, and a letter from a nurse practitioner to a consultant seeking advice was lost.
Mr Ithell was not seen by a consultant until October, 2022, after an urgent referral by his GP following routine blood tests.
He died the following month and his cancer was recorded as the cause of death.
Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board has until 18 March to respond to the coroner's concerns.
Its Executive Medical Director Dr Nick Lyons said: ""On behalf of the health board, I offer my deepest condolences to Mr Ithell's family for their very sad loss.
""We note the coroner's findings that Mr Ithell died of natural causes and fully accept their wider points regarding the improvements needed in our incident investigation process.
""A review of that process is underway and this will be completed by the end of March, along with an improved training programme for our staff.
""We are committed to becoming an organisation that continually learns and improves - this is a major focus in our special measures improvement programme, with a number of changes being delivered this year.""

SEO474V86K_IWPOWMH48NQDCYP,Tata steelworkers lobby MPs on thousands of job losses,By Huw Thomas & Gareth Lewis,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-68068710,"Steelworkers from south Wales have travelled to Westminster to lobby MPs over plans to cut thousands of jobs.
Tata Steel plans to cut 2,800 from its UK workforce and close both blast furnaces in Port Talbot.
Mark Davies, whose son also works in Port Talbot, said it was ""a worry for people about where they'll get jobs"" in future.
Meanwhile, the first minister said he was ""baffled"" Rishi Sunak did not take a call from him on Tata last week.
Union leaders met UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, ahead of the party's Commons debate on the future of the steel industry.
Senedd members also discussed Tata's plans, in Cardiff Bay.
Tata has said its current operations are financially unviable and it will focus on producing greener steel.
The company will build a Â£1.25bn electric arc furnace after the UK government contributed Â£500m towards its cost.
But it will end the production of steel from scratch, known as virgin steel, this year.
Mark Davies has worked in Port Talbot for 42 years, and wanted staff of all ages to be protected from redundancies.
""We want to see the next generations making a good living there,"" he said.
""My boy is only 28, he's in the cold mill. And it is a worry about where they'll get jobs going forward.""
Mr Davies said he wanted to see Labour ""come off the fence with a firm commitment"" about reversing Tata Steel's plans.
The unions want at least one blast furnace to remain operational until the electric furnace is built.
As well as its financial concerns, Tata Steel has said it would be a safety risk to begin construction while hot metal was still being produced on site.
""I think it's important we go up and show a presence in parliament, for the government to see how serious we are,"" Gary Keogh said.
A veteran of the steelworks, Mr Keogh said he ""expects some answers from the government about why they're prepared to throw our community and our industry away"".
Those who travelled by train were members of Community, the union that represents most of the workers in the ""heavy end"" of Port Talbot's steelworks.
Another 300 jobs may go at Tata's Llanwern site, in Newport, in three years' time.
Jacqueline Thomas, who has worked there for nearly two decades, said the plant is like a ""second family to me"".
""At the moment the second family is being destroyed, we're under a tremendous amount of stress,"" she said, speaking outside the UK Parliament.
""It's predominantly a very young workforce, there's young lads I know that have had children and got married, and I look upon them sometimes as my own children.
""At the moment it's devastating.""
The Unite union also lobbied MPs.
In the Commons debate, Labour business spokesperson Jonathan Reynolds urged UK ministers and Tata ""to think again and change course"" over the closure of the Port Talbot blast furnaces and subsequent job losses.
He said it would be a ""calamitous mistake for the UK to become, under the Conservatives, the first major economy in the world without the ability to make our own primary steel"".
Mr Reynolds said it was ""profoundly wrong"" for Rishi Sunak not to talk to First Minister Mark Drakeford when the news about the job losses broke last Friday, something Mr Drakeford told the Welsh Parliament earlier he had been ""baffled"" by.
Welsh Secretary David TC Davies told MPs he was prepared to speak to Mr Drakeford but the first minister was ""too busy"".
Mr Reynolds replied: ""I have to say I think that's a pathetic response. I mean no discourtesy but I think that's pathetic, it is entirely reasonable for the first minister of Wales to see a conversation with the prime minister of the United Kingdom.""
Business minister Nusrat Ghani, said it was ""difficult"" for steelworkers but the UK government was working ""to ensure that steel making continues in the UK, providing it with unprecedented levels of investment"".
Without the UK government support there would have been ""a complete risk of Tata not continuing to make steel in the UK"", she added.
Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP who has the Port Talbot plant in his Aberavon constituency, said the steelworks was ""the beating heart of our community"", calling on Tata to reconsider the transition plan put forward by unions.
""I urge Tata Steel to take the bridge not the cliff edge,"" he said. ""Their deal is a cliff edge which will send our workforce, our proud communities, over that cliff edge, that is not something we can accept.""
Plaid Cymru Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts, called for the nationalisation of the steel industry.
""If we could save the banks in 2008, why can't we save steel now? Look at Germany whose government spent Â£2.6bn in state aid to steel producers to aid decarbonisation projects only last year.""
""We're being let down once again by a Westminster government who intends on stripping Welsh assets while leaving the Senedd to bear the costs to communities and individual lives thrown on the scrap heap.""
Do you work for Tata Steel? Get in touch.
Ms Saville Roberts questioned Labour's solutions ""as they continue to scale back on their Â£28bn green investment pledge.""
""Solutions from Westminster are a dead end"" she said.
Welsh Secretary Mr Davies insisted that the UK government had found itself in the ""difficult situation, the unpleasant, the awful situation, of having to choose between three thousand people losing their jobs and seventeen-and-a-half thousand people losing their jobs"".
""That's why we came to the decision we did,"" he said.
Earlier, Mark Drakeford told the Senedd he was ""genuinely baffled"" that Rishi Sunak could not find the time to take a call from him about Tata on Friday morning.
In First Minister's Questions, Mr Drakeford said former prime minister Theresa May had spoken to him when Ford announced the closure of its Bridgend engine plant in 2019.
Also during the question session, Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies disagreed with the plans to close both blast furnaces in Port Talbot, saying that keeping one open was ""a feasible objective for the transition to arc furnaces"".
His view differs from that taken by his Conservative colleagues in Westminster.

SJE0A4N37C_JRNJXMOXK0GL41K,NI weather: More travel disruption as Storm Jocelyn follows Isha,_,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-68052333,"The main road to Belfast International Airport was among roads closed on Tuesday evening as this week's second storm hit Northern Ireland.
High winds and fallen trees due to Storm Jocelyn have resulted in some road closures, with some train journeys and flights also affected.
A yellow warning for wind is in force until 13:00 GMT on Wednesday.
Jocelyn followed Storm Isha which blew in on Sunday, causing power cuts that are still affecting 3,000 customers.
NIE Networks estimated the number of customers affected by outages would rise again as Jocelyn brought strong winds over Tuesday night and into Wednesday.
The company said it would continue working to restore supplies where it is safe to do so.
Storm Jocelyn was not expected to be as severe as Storm Isha. However, gusts of up to 71mph were recorded in Northern Ireland on Tuesday evening.
Up until 22:00 GMT the strongest gusts measured were at Castlederg (71mph), Orlock Point (71mph) and Magilligan (59mph).
The Met Office said that, following the impact of Storm Isha, ""resilience is expected to be lower"", which could hamper ongoing recovery and repair efforts.
There could be further damage to buildings, power cuts, and disruption to transport, it said.

Old Stone Road, the main road to the international airport, was closed between the A6 Belfast Road and Seven Mile Straight on Tuesday evening due to a fallen tree.
The A23 Ballygowan Road was also closed at Moneyreagh due to a fallen tree, while Foyle Bridge in Derry was closed to high-sided vehicles due to strong winds.
In Lisburn, the traffic lights went out of action at the junction of Ballinderry Road and Knockmore Road, amid power failures in the area.
Some flights to and from George Best Belfast City Airport have been cancelled on Tuesday.
Flights scheduled to arrive from Manchester, Birmingham and Edinburgh are not going ahead as planned, while one flight scheduled to depart earlier to Manchester was also cancelled.
Dublin Airport has also experienced eight flight cancellations, seven ""go-arounds"" and two Dublin-bound flights were diverted to Belfast.
Speaking earlier, Alex Houston of NIE Networks told BBC NI's Evening Extra programme that about 250 electricity poles and 300 wires had already been badly damaged during Isha.
He said there was still a lot of damage across Northern Ireland, with fallen trees, fallen wires and broken poles. He advised members of the public to be cautious and report all faults, adding that NIE Networks was working 24-7 to restore power to all those affected.
However, he confirmed that further damage is expected from Storm Jocelyn through the night.
Damage to the roof of Titanic Belfast has also caused the visitor attraction to close on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The site's operations director Siobhan Lynch said pre-booked customers will be notified and refunded and has apologised for the inconvenience.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland reported it had 670 call-outs related to Storm Isha between 15:00 on Sunday and 03:00 on Monday.
In County Londonderry, a motorist died after a tree hit his car in Limavady.
Multiple trees, including three of the famous Dark Hedges beeches, were damaged in the storm leaving some roads impassable.
In the Republic of Ireland, a yellow warning is in place across the country from Tuesday afternoon, into Wednesday morning.
Weather service Met Ãireann also issued status orange warnings - the second-highest alert - for counties Mayo and Galway, effective until midnight, and for County Donegal, effective until 02:00 on Wednesday.
ESB Networks have said 14,000 customers had lost power on Tuesday.
This is in addition to 24,000 premises, mostly in the north west, still without power due to Storm Isha.
The company has restored power to approximately 221,000 homes, farms and businesses since Sunday's weather warnings, it said.
Electricity supplier ESB's Mark Madigan said extra resources were being deployed to the north west.
County Donegal, where about 25,000 customers were without power, was particularly affected.

SJETEBIOBM_LRPWA8X3Y22W8RU,United Automobile Workers union endorses Biden for re-election,By Sam Cabral,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68088778,"The United Automobile Workers, a major US union representing more than 400,000 people, has endorsed the re-election bid of President Joe Biden.
It comes after the Democrat, 81, joined UAW workers on a picket line last year, in a first for a sitting president.
Mr Biden is expected to face off in the November general election against Donald Trump, who polls more strongly among blue-collar voters.
The UAW endorsement may boost his efforts to eat into that advantage.
Though the UAW backed Mr Biden ahead of the 2020 election, its new leadership declined last year to join other high-profile unions in endorsing his re-election. President Shawn Fain had said a 2024 endorsement should ""be earned, not freely given"".
But Mr Fain said Wednesday that members, mostly workers in car and truck factories, face a choice between voting for ""someone who stands up with us and supports our cause"" or for ""someone who will divide us and fight us every step of the way"".
""If our endorsements have to be earned, Joe Biden has earned it,"" he said at the close of the UAW's three-day national conference in Washington DC.
Mr Biden - who often refers to himself as the most pro-union US leader - donned a UAW ballcap and said ""it's great to be home"" as he accepted the endorsement.
""I'm honoured to have your back and you have my back. That's a deal,"" he told a sea of rank-and-file union members in red polo shirts.
In September, the president - with bullhorn in hand - joined union members on strike from a General Motors parts warehouse in Detroit, Michigan.

Watch: Biden addresses autoworkers on picket line
The unprecedented show of support came as the UAW took on the big three US automakers - GM, Ford and Stellantis - all at once in contract negotiations, by going on individual strikes with little notice and on a rolling basis.
Mr Trump, who held an event a day later at a non-union plant in Michigan, dismissed the incident as ""nothing more than a PR stunt"".
But by November, union leaders had brokered a historic new contract that included record wage hikes and cost-of-living adjustments.
""You built these companies, you sacrificed to save them in the worst of times and you deserve to benefit when these companies thrive,"" Mr Biden said on Wednesday.
""The days of working people being dealt out of the deal are over in this country.""
Mr Fain praised the president for his role in the negotiations, saying he had ""heard the call"" and ""joined us in solidarity"" in addition to vocally supporting the right to strike and creating new opportunities to organise.
By contrast, the previous president had ""trashed our union"" and taken actions to ""screw the American middle class"", he alleged.
The UAW endorsement may motivate its members to vote for Mr Biden, who has been plagued by low approval ratings and is struggling to build enthusiasm for his re-election bid.
This is particularly true for those workers concentrated in the auto-making battleground state of Michigan, where Mr Biden needs to cut into his opponent's lead with working-class voters.
Though he defeated Mr Trump in the state in 2020, Mr Biden is facing a revolt this year from its sizeable Arab-American electorate as well as many young voters over his position on the Israel-Gaza conflict.
Offering a preview of those electability concerns, protesters demanding a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted Mr Biden's remarks, in what is becoming a common occurrence at his public events.

SMRNMC72L5_E2JGEYGGIXXYDAP,Former Irwin's bakery worker receives Â£75k in age discrimination case,_,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-68061649,"This video can not be played
""It was devastating. Suddenly, I didn't have an income""
A County Fermanagh man has received Â£75,000 after his former employer settled an age discrimination case.
Seamus Gillespie, 62, worked for WD Irwin and Sons bakery from 1991 until he was made redundant in August 2022.
The case, supported by the Equality Commission, was settled without admission of liability by the company.
WD Irwin and Sons said it was strongly committed to equality and prided itself on its commitment to diversity in the workplace.
Mr Gillespie alleged he was told the company was looking for younger people from a blue-chip background in terms of future recruitment.
He believed the company thought the age of staff within the business was problematic.
""I knew that was leaving my position vulnerable,"" Mr Gillespie told BBC News NI.
The former sales manager further alleged that he was told he would lose certain accounts when the vacant position of business unit controller was filled.
This, he believed, led to a significant reduction in his workload, diminishing his role and leaving him vulnerable to potential future redundancy.
In August 2022, Mr Gillespie was informed of a project involving changes in distribution.
He believed he should have been included in relevant discussions because it impacted on his work.
The following month, Mr Gillespie was informed his position was at risk of redundancy, with him being the sole member of the redundancy pool.
During subsequent redundancy meetings, he alleged comments were made about the necessity of injecting ""new blood"" into the business and concerns were raised about the uniform age profile within the senior management team.
Despite his appeal, Mr Gillespie was ultimately made redundant.
""I was very happy working in the company. I loved what I was doing. I certainly had no plans to retire,"" he said.
""It was just devastating. All of a sudden that you didn't have an income, security. You didn't have any basic hope for the future.
""I worked for Irwins for over 30 years. I enjoyed my job, I was a dedicated, hardworking and loyal employee, with lots of experience.
""But it was very clear to me, following discussions with management, that my career with the company was over.""
""I'm glad my case is now settled, although I would rather that none of this had happened in the first place,"" he added.
""People of an age have a lot of experience and they can make very good decisions and be great mentors to people coming into the business.""
Chief commissioner Geraldine McGahey said Mr Gillespie ""still had a lot to offer"" his former employer.
""Seamus gave 30 years of his working life to Irwin's bakery. He felt that his age was a problem for his employer and believes that was why he was made redundant,"" she said.
""In Northern Ireland it is unlawful to discriminate against employees because of their age.
""Older workers have experience, skills and attributes that our economy needs to thrive. They are assets to their employers, just like every other employee.
""It is imperative that employers have robust policies and practices in place to prevent any potential instances of age discrimination and that staff are adequately trained to use them.""
In setting the case without admission, WD Irwin and Sons Ltd denied any liability.
It reaffirmed its ""strong commitment to the principle of equality"" and agreed to liaise with the commission to review policies, practices and procedures - an outcome that Mr Gillespie said he was ""heartened"" to hear.
""WD Irwin & Sons has always prided itself on its commitment to diversity in the workplace,"" a spokesperson said.

SN9CT20LXI_0WUJ7MRMFFQ9FVV,Thatchers lose trademark fight with Aldi over rival cider drinks,By Bea Swallow & PA Media,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-68086529,"Thatchers brewery has lost a High Court trademark battle against Aldi over rival cider products.
The Somerset-based brewer sued the supermarket chain over claims Aldi had ""copycatted"" its Cloudy Lemon Cider ""in both taste and appearance"".
Following a blind taste test, Judge Melissa Clarke ruled on Wednesday there was a ""low degree of similarity"".
An Aldi spokesperson said: ""There's nothing cloudy about this judgement. It's clear cut.""
At a trial in London in November, Thatchers accused Aldi of gaining an ""unfair advantage"" in sales by copying the product which the family-run cider business had released in February 2020.
Thatchers claimed Aldi's Taurus drink, released in May 2022, had been ""riding on the coat-tails of the reputation"" of the Thatchers brand, and was ""misleading shoppers to believe that the ciders are the same, or in some way linked.""
Fourth generation cider maker Martin Thatcher said: ""As a Somerset family expertly crafting cider for 120 years, we were compelled to bring this case.
""Aldi clearly recognised the popularity of Thatchers Cloudy Lemon, a premium product that we developed by studying consumer trends and investing in innovation.""
Aldi denied claims it was ""passing off"" its product as one appearing to be from Thatchers.
It accepted use of the Thatchers product as a ""benchmark"", but denied infringement of property rights.
""Aldi exclusive brands are just that: exclusive to Aldi, while leading the market on quality and price,"" a spokesperson said.
Judge Clarke accepted that seeing the Aldi product ""would call to mind"" the Thatchers trademark, but ruled there was ""no likelihood of confusion"" for consumers.
""I found the taste of the two products to be very similar, but I accept they are different,"" she said.
The judge determined that Aldi did not develop its product ""with an intention to take advantage of the goodwill and reputation"" of the Thatchers brand, nor was it ""detrimental"" to the brewer's reputation.
She added the claim that Aldi's sales could only be the result of gaining unfair advantage from Thatchers' reputation ""amounts to little more than supposition"".
""It's clear to us that Aldi was intent on creating a product that rides on the premium position of Thatchers,"" added Mr Thatcher.
""So much so, that in their product development we were the only brand featured as inspiration.
""We are very disappointed that the Judge didn't agree with us, but it won't stop us from continuing to innovate and producing premium ciders.""

SVUQ380M2T_L2REZCN1ZQF1LTO,Ghana coup plot: Soldiers among six sentenced to death by hanging,By Wycliffe Muia,4 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-68090780,"Six Ghanaians, including three soldiers, have been sentenced to death by hanging for their involvement in a coup plot three years ago.
This was the first treason trial in Ghana since 1966 when post-independence leader Kwame Nkrumah was overthrown.
The six were arrested in 2021 while testing weapons in the capital, Accra, to allegedly topple the government.
The group, including a gunsmith, pleaded not guilty during a trial that captured the attention of the nation.
Defence lawyers said they would appeal against the ruling in the Supreme Court.
Three other people, including a senior police officer and two military officers, were acquitted.
There was a heavy security deployment outside the High Court in Accra during the sentencing on Wednesday.
The court found the six guilty of high treason and conspiracy to commit high treason.
The men were arrested with locally manufactured guns, improvised explosive devices and AK-47 rifles, according to court documents.
State prosecutors said the group had planned to organise protests, ostensibly to topple President Nana Akufo-Addo's government ahead of the 2020 general elections.
The court said it found the evidence against the men, including intercepted communications and testimonies, compelling.
Attorney General Godfred Yeboah Dame, who led the prosecution, praised the court verdict as ""significant"".
""The constitution of Ghana as the fundamental law of the country, which has sustained the stability of the nation, frowns seriously upon any attempt to overthrow a government and that is why that offence [treason] is punishable by death,"" Mr Dame said.
Ghana had last carried out an execution in 1992 when it returned to democratic rule.
Last year lawmakers last year voted to abolish the death penalty for ordinary crimes, replacing it with a life sentence.

SVV5OJO996_SQCQCA9QVF3Q9I5,Conservative attacks on National Trust are desperate - Starmer,By Kate Whannel,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68054536,"Conservative Party attacks on the National Trust are desperate and damaging, Sir Keir Starmer has said.
Addressing a summit of charities and not-for-profit groups, the Labour leader said the Conservatives had got ""tangled up in culture wars of their own making"".
He said a Labour government would ""reset"" the relationship between government and civil society.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hit back accusing Sir Keir of not having a plan.
The prime minister said he hadn't seen the Labour leader's speech but added that ""it does sound to me like a distraction from the fact that Keir Starmer, who has been leader of the opposition for four years, can't actually say what he would do differently to run this country"".
In recent years the National Trust, a conservation charity, has been criticised by Conservative MPs.
In 2020 a group of backbenchers objected to the National Trust linking the family home of Winston Churchill to slavery and colonialism.
Last year, Lee Anderson, who was then a deputy chair of the Conservative Party, criticised the charity for listing policies it wanted the government to commit to. He told GB News ""Brits expect the National Trust to protect our heritage, not lecture them on net zero.""
Another Conservative MP - Jacob Rees-Mogg - backed a group seeking to change the National Trust, saying in a social media post: ""The National Trust should remain true to its founding principles and stay clear of identity politics, which has already alienated tens of thousands of members.""
Sir Keir also said Conservative rhetoric had ""helped demonise"" the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI).
The RNLI, which rescues people at sea, has also received attention for its role in helping migrants at risk of drowning in the Channel when trying to get to the UK in small boats.
Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage said the group was being used as a ""taxi service for illegal trafficking groups"" but Conservatives have generally been supportive of the RNLI.
In 2022, then Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the charity was an ""incredible organisation, which responds first in many instances to incidents of crisis and emergency, saving lives and helping people in distress"".
""They have my full support,"" she added.
Speaking at the Civil Society Summit in central London, Sir Keir said ""the Tories seem set on sabotaging civil society to save their own skins.
""Instead of working with the National Trust so more people can learn about - and celebrate - our culture and our history, they've managed to demean their work.""
He also accused the Conservatives of ""undertaking a kind of weird McCarthyism, trying to find woke agendas in the very civic institutions they once regarded with respect"".
""Waging a war on the proud spirit of service in this country isn't leadership. It's desperate. It's divisive. It's damaging.
The Labour leader said former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who famously said there was no such thing as society, had allowed individualism to ""run rampant"", while David Cameron's 'Big Society' had been undermined by cuts to public spending.
He said a Labour government would ""harness civil society as one of the three key engines for renewal working alongside the public and private sectors"".

SXF0GPB4YI_VIQHO9SFZ03LVSJ,'Significant changes' coming for Irish trade to GB,John Campbell,22 January 2024,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cw4m7j9zrgjo,"The Irish government has urged exporters to Great Britain to be ready for new post-Brexit border controls which apply from the end of January.
It is part of a long-delayed UK plan to apply more controls and checks on EU imports.
Irish Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue said it meant a ""significant change in the trading environment"" for Irish agri-food exporters to Great Britain.
The changes do not apply to goods going to Northern Ireland.
Trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland is covered by the Windsor Framework meaning there are no new checks or controls.
When the UK left the EU in 2021 goods from Great Britain were immediately subject to the customs and regulatory processes applied to the imports from any non-member state.
Goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland also faced new controls as Northern Ireland remained inside the EU's single market for goods.
However, the UK government was not ready to apply controls on EU goods and the introduction of those controls has been delayed on five occasions in the subsequent years.
The changes will finally start to be implemented from 31 January with full customs processes and the pre-notification and official certification of some agri-food products.
This will add a significant administrative burden to EU to Great Britain agri-food exports and Ireland will be particularly affected as the UK remains its single biggest market for food exports.
Mr McConalogue said: ""All businesses in the agri-food supply chain to GB must continue to engage with their UK customers, their local supervisory competent authority team and logistics providers to confirm the processes are in place to meet the new UK requirements in the most effective and efficient manner.""
It is understood that the Irish government is not anticipating significant problems with the new arrangements as large exporters are well prepared and UK authorities are expected to take an initial approach of 'education not enforcement.'
It is still unclear when Irish agri-food products will start to be physically inspected at Great Britain ports.
Goods from the rest of the EU will start to face physical checks from April but goods from Ireland will not be subject to checks any earlier than October.
The government is yet to clarify how it will discriminate between Irish and Northern Irish goods arriving from Northern Ireland ports without imposing any new bureaucracy on Northern Ireland businesses."

It shortlists the closure of sites in Welshpool in Powys, and Caernarfon in Gwynedd, with the emergency helicopters relocated to north-east Wales.
In March 2023 the charity announced both sites would remain operational until at least 2026.
That followed a Â£65m contract signing with Gama Aviation to operate and maintain its Airbus H145 helicopters.
However, before that agreement the plan had been to consolidate the Powys and Gwynedd bases, allowing the service to respond to more than 500 extra emergencies a year.
The latest news is likely to anger long-term campaigners in mid Wales who say they fear rural areas will lose out if the Welshpool and Caernarfon bases were to close.
They would prefer keeping both open and adding an emergency response vehicle to a location in Denbighshire.
In 2022 an online petition to save the Caernarfon site reached almost 5,000 signatures.
When plans to close the Welshpool base were initially revealed they also met criticism and concern, with one previous air ambulance patient labelling the move ""completely bonkers"".
The Emergency Ambulance Services Committee (EASC) has been carrying out the review into air ambulance provision in order to ""improve and adapt the service to meet as much demand in Wales as possible"".
Details will be discussed at a meeting of the EASC next week before a final round of public engagement takes place in February.

T2RZBUFB4Q_PD8IDGFPDC7UZE7,Bexley mother 'burnt out' in fight for son's special educational needs,By Nicky Ford,5 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-68068106,"A mother in south-east London says she feels ""burnt out"" from having to ""fight"" for an education that meets the needs of her son.
Gemma Ekrem's son Harley, six, has special educational needs (Sen). She is taking Bexley Council to a tribunal to access a specialist school for him.
The council said it has ""supported Ms Ekrem's family and will continue [to]"".
She is among a growing number of parents taking councils to tribunal across London over Sen provision.
Ms Ekrem's three children previously attended a primary school in Bexley but she said she felt unable to return after Harley ran out of the school gates and into a busy road.
His elder brother, Hayden, then chased after him and managed to get him to safety, but Ms Ekrem said the incident had left her traumatised.
""I just thought my son was dead. I thought two sons could possibly have been dead,"" she said.
""I couldn't face going back to the school. I associate that road with the road where my son nearly died and so do my kids.""
However, Ms Ekrem was then threatened with legal action from Bexley Council if her children did not return to the school.
Harley has complex educational needs - he is autistic, has global development delay and ADHD, as does her eldest son Ethan.
Both children have an Educational Health Care Plan (ECHP) - a document outlining a child's special educational, health, and social care needs and the support required to meet them.
Ms Ekrem asked Bexley Council to provide a home tutor for all her sons on the grounds the authority has a statutory duty to provide an education if the children have not been in school for 15 days.
While her eldest two children started at new schools, it took seven months for Harley to get a tutor. Yet Ms Ekrem believes it is clear he needs to be in a specialist school with his ECHP requiring to be changed.
""Harley doesn't associate home with school so getting him to engage with his tutor is really hard work,"" she said.
""His routine is all over the place. If he was at a specialist school he would be thriving.""
There is only one specialist school in the borough and it has a long waiting list.
Ms Ekrem is now facing the prospect of taking Bexley Council to a tribunal to amend his EHCP which could take at least a year, adding to the pressure she says she is facing.
""We're a carer for our kids, we're their advocate, their voice, their teacher and everything built in and a lot of us have no energy, we're burnt out,"" she said.
A Bexley Council spokesperson said: ""We believe that education is vital to our children and young people and it is because of this that officers from a number of departments have been in contact with Mrs Ekrem over the past few months.
""We are keen to address Mrs Ekrem's concerns and would welcome the opportunity to meet with her to discuss them.""
Ms Ekrem is not alone in taking her local council to a tribunal.
Figures reveal record numbers of parents are using legal tribunals to challenge councils' decisions made about their children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send).
Schools in England must provide support to children with special educational needs and if a child needs more support than a school can provide, they may qualify for an EHCP.
In 2015, a year after Send reforms were introduced, 909 Send tribunal appeals were made in London. By 2022, that figure had almost doubled in London, with 1,638 appeals made in the capital.
It is a similar case across England. By the end of last year 13,658 families in England had registered an appeal - a rise of 24% from the year before - while of the 7,986 decisions that made it through to a tribunal, 7,829 ruled in favour of those making the appeal.
This equates to a council success rate of just 1.7%
The Liberal Democrat education spokesperson and MP for Twickenham Munira Wilson said EHCPs were being rationed by local authorities because of the growing demand and the lack of resources.
""There is a real pressure at the local level and the fact that schools have to pay the first Â£6,000 towards an EHCP that is a disincentive to identify children early,"" she said.
The MP also described the Sen system as ""broken"", adding that the ""Â£100m"" which has been spent on tribunals is ""money that could be spent on Send provision"".
Councillor Louise Gittins, chair of the Local Government Association's children and young people board said councils ""fully recognise the right of families to take appeals to tribunals"".
She said the gap between the cost of Send support and available funding is about Â£1.9bn and urged the government to write off ""high needs deficits"" in council budgets.
A Department for Education spokesperson said that while the ""vast majority"" of EHCPs are put in place without resorting to tribunals, ""the system needs to work better for parents"".
They said the government has set up ""ambitious reforms to the system"" including plans for strengthened mediation between parents and councils before cases go to tribunals as well as the creation of ""consistent, high-quality national standards"".
The spokesperson added that funding for children and young people with complex needs will reach over Â£10.5 billion in 2024-25 - an increase of over 60% since 2019-20.

TBOY4BPOIN_Y1NK2I1HG08U3N7,Millions lose access to free NHS earwax removal,By Jim Reed,5 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-68071665,"Almost 10 million people in England can no longer access free NHS earwax removal services, the RNID has warned.
The hearing loss charity said there was ""no medical reason"" for the withdrawal of NHS services across parts of England since 2019.
And some people unable to afford private treatment were turning to ""dangerous self-removal methods"".
The government said GPs can still refer patients on to a specialist service if the problem is linked to hearing loss.
Each year, about 2.3 million people in the UK need earwax treatment, according to the NHS.
It is more common among older people, hearing-aid users and those with a learning disability.
Wax build-up in the ear canal can cause painful symptoms including tinnitus, earache and hearing loss.
It often requires removal before a hearing test and can interfere with certain hearing aids, causing a distracting whistling sound.
Helen Kendall, 76, from Bath, Somerset, says she now has to pay Â£240 a year for private treatment, because the GPs in her area no longer offer a free service.
""When the wax builds up, I find it very difficult,"" she says.
""I lost some of my confidence and became unable to follow conversations.
""It led to increased isolation and I found I was withdrawing.
""I'm a sociable person - I volunteer at a food bank, I'm part of an art group and cook for a lunch club and I love the cinema.
""All of these rely on me being able to hear properly.""
National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guidelines say wax removal should be provided in GP surgeries or other local ear-care services.
There are two main methods:
The RNID sent Freedom of Information requests to all 42 integrated health boards across England.
Of the 40 that responded:.
The charity's director of health, Crystal Rolfe, said: ""For the 10 million people who live in areas where there is no provision, the only option is to pay for it, which we know can cost up to Â£100 for just one procedure.
""Previous research shows that 26% of people say they wouldn't be able to afford that, partly because some people need to have earwax removed several times a year.""

7 areasBirmingham & Solihull, Cornwall & Scilly Isles, Dorset, Mid & South Essex, NW London, SW London, Suffolk & NE Essex
The RNID says it recognises NHS boards are operating under financial constraints, but this is not an acceptable reason to reduce provision.
In some areas it says patients are being told the service no longer exists even though GPs are still contracted to run it.
The concern is that more people may be trying to remove wax themselves using methods it describes as dangerous.
The strong advice is ""never put anything in your ear smaller than your elbow"".
Other objects - from cotton buds to paper clips and hairpins or even fingers - should never be used in the ear canal itself.
""For most people, it's a self-cleansing mechanism and the wax just comes out on its own,"" Ms Rolfe says.
""If it's got stuck in your ear, then you should go and see a GP, who might sometimes suggest olive oil drops in the first instance.""
Some commercial drops are available over the counter - but there is ""little evidence"" drops or sprays will resolve the issue in more than one out of every five people, the RNID says.
Drops would not be recommended for those who have had a recent infection or operation - and the patient should speak to a pharmacist first.
The government said local health boards are responsible for commissioning services in their area based on the needs of the population, and GPs can still refer patients to a specialist audiology service if the problem is linked to hearing loss.
An NHS England spokeswoman said information about treating earwax safely at home was also available on the NHS website.
The Scottish and Welsh governments remained ""committed to ensure the availability of NHS earwax-removal services"", the RNID said. And it would ""lobby for the same commitment"" in Northern Ireland, once devolved government was restored.
But patients from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have contacted BBC News saying they are also facing the same issue with a lack of NHS services for getting earwax removed.

Watch: Jennifer Crumbley emotional as involuntary manslaughter trial begins
A mother who is the first US parent ever to go on trial for failing to stop her son from carrying out a deadly school shooting has sobbed in court as she saw CCTV of the attack.
Jennifer Crumbley's lawyer said the prosecution was intended to ""send a message to gun owners"".
Mrs Crumbley, 45, denies a charge of involuntary manslaughter.
Her son is serving life in prison for killing four classmates at Oxford High School in Michigan in 2021.
Mrs Crumbley's husband, James, is facing a separate trial on the same charges, which are punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
During the attacker's trial last year, his attorneys argued he was neglected by his parents and suffered from mental illness. But he later said his parents did not know about his plans and that he was solely responsible.
The trial opened on Thursday, and Mrs Crumbley wept as jurors were shown a video captured by a school security camera on the day of the shooting.
Prosecutor Karen McDonald objected that the defendant and her attorney were ""sobbing"" in violation of the judge's request for those in court to control their emotions during the trial.
""We were not sobbing or making a scene,"" said Mrs Crumbley's attorney, Shannon Smith, raising her voice. ""All my eye makeup is still on.""
The defendant's legal team says she is being unfairly blamed because she could not have predicted her son's actions.
At opening arguments, Ms Smith began her defence by quoting Taylor Swift's song Bad Blood, saying: ""Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes.""
She accused prosecutors of charging her client ""in an effort to make the community feel better, in an effort to make people feel like someone is being held responsible, in an effort to send a message to gun owners"".
""And none of those problems will be solved with charging Jennifer Crumbley with involuntary manslaughter.""
But lawyers for the state argued the case is not about bad parenting or gun rights.
Prosecutor Marc Keast told the jury: ""Jennifer Crumbley didn't pull the trigger that day, but she is responsible for those deaths.""
""We're not here to talk about good parenting or bad parenting,"" he added. ""It's not illegal to be a bad parent.""

August 2023: Victims recount horror, grief of Michigan school shooting
Prosecutors say that Mr and Mrs Crumbley gave their son the murder weapon as a Christmas gift, and did not help him get the mental health support he needed.
Her lawyers have blamed her husband, saying he was responsible for ensuring the gun was safely stored at home.
Both parents attempted to flee after being charged with manslaughter and were found hiding in the basement of a Detroit warehouse. Their lawyers say they left home for their safety and planned to turn themselves in later.
There were three witnesses on Thursday: the school principal, a teacher who survived the attack and an employee of the gun shop where the killer and his father shopped for his handgun.
On the day of the shooting, school officials found the boy, who was then 15, with disturbing drawings.
His parents were called to school to review the drawings, but left after concluding the meeting in only 11 minutes, Mr Keast said.
None of the adults checked the boy's backpack, where he stored the gun, and he was sent back to class.

Barnaby Webber and Grace O'Malley-Kumar, both 19, were fatally stabbed on 13 June along with Ian Coates, 65.
Their killer will be detained at a high-security hospital after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
Mr Webber's mother said ""true justice has not been served"".
University of Nottingham students Mr Webber and Ms O'Malley-Kumar were fatally stabbed in Ilkeston Road just after 04:00 BST, while Mr Coates was found dead with knife injuries in Magdala Road after his van was stolen.
Pedestrians Wayne Birkett, Marcin Gawronski and Sharon Miller were then driven at in Milton Street and Upper Parliament Street, in the city centre.
The 32-year-old, who had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia before the attacks, also pleaded guilty to three counts of attempted murder.

Footage shows timeline of Nottingham attacks and killer's arrest
Speaking outside Nottingham Crown Court following sentencing on Thursday, the victims' families voiced their anger at the outcome.
Emma Webber, the mother of Mr Webber, said ""true justice has not been served today"", adding the families had been ""let down"" by police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).
She accused Nottinghamshire Police's Assistant Chief Constable Rob Griffin of having ""blood on his hands"", following the force's failure to detain Calocane after an arrest warrant was issued in September 2022, over an assault on an officer.
And she claimed the CPS had, in November, presented her family with ""a fait accompli that the decision had been made to accept manslaughter charges"".
""At no point during the previous five and a half months were we given any indication that this could conclude in anything other than murder,"" she said.
""We trusted in our system, foolishly as it turns out.""
In response, a CPS spokesperson said it had met the families of Mr Webber and Ms O'Malley-Kumar online, and then again in person in December, with further offers to meet made ""throughout"".
They added: ""Engagement with those who have been left bereaved is one of our highest priorities and in all cases, we continue to liaise with victims' families throughout the legal process.""

Nottingham attacks: Victims' families react to triple killer's sentence
James Coates, son of Ian Coates, said his family had ""suffered a great loss"".
""The failures from the police, the courts and the health service have resulted in the murder of my father,"" he added.
And Grace O'Malley-Kumar's father, Dr Sanjoy Kumar, said: ""We will never come to terms with the loss of our beloved daughter Grace, how she lost her life [and] her heroic actions.""
He added: ""While we have never questioned this man's diagnosis, the lack of toxicology, contemporaneous mental health assessment, as well as missed opportunities to divert his lethal path, will forever play on our minds and this requires further review.""
On Thursday, the CPS set out why it decided to accept a diminished responsibility plea rather than continue to push for Calocane to be jailed for murder.
The CPS said medical experts provided ""overwhelming"" evidence Calocane was suffering from a serious mental health condition, including hearing voices in his head telling him his family would be harmed unless he did what they told him to do.
Three psychiatrists were asked to analyse Calocane's condition and all agreed it ""impaired his ability to exercise self-control"".
The CPS ""took the unusual step"" of asking a fourth expert to review those reports, and after they agreed with the findings, prosecutors concluded there was ""no realistic prospect of conviction for murder"".

The moment Valdo Calocane is sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court
Mr Justice Turner told Calocane he remained a danger and the sentence would ""result in you being detained in a high-security hospital, very probably for the rest of your life"".
""In the early hours of 13 June last year, you committed a series of atrocities in this city, which ended the lives of three innocent people,"" he said.
""Your sickening crimes both shocked the nation and wrecked the lives of your surviving victims and the families of them all.""
He added the ""central issue"" was ""whether at the time of committing these offences, you were suffering from symptoms of severe mental disorder"".
The judge said, however, the psychiatric evidence did not detract from the ""horror"" and ""disastrous"" impact of the offences, but he said, in his view, Calocane's abnormality of mind ""significantly contributed"" to him perpetrating the attacks.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has sent his ""heartfelt condolences"" to the victims' families, but he declined to say whether he would order a public inquiry into the case.
He said: ""It was an absolutely awful case and as a parent, you think when you send your kids out into the world or university they'll be safe. I can't imagine the pain they are going through at the moment.""
Mr Sunak said it was ""right"" Calocane would ""spend very probably the rest of his life"" in a high-security hospital.
Lawyers for Mr Birkett, one of the pedestrians who suffered serious injuries when he was struck by the van, said he believed a public inquiry was required.
In a statement, they said he was disappointed with Calocane's sentence and that all the victims ""have been let down by the system that is meant to protect them"".
They said: ""Wayne's life will never be the same. He will require extensive rehabilitation and care for many years to come.""
In a statement, the University of Nottingham said it was continuing to support its community in coming to terms with the loss of Mr Webber and Ms O'Malley-Kumar, who ""touched the lives so many"".
It added it was committed to working with agencies in any reviews into how similar tragedies could be avoided in the future.
Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust chief executive Ifti Majid said the organisation had ""robustly"" reviewed its treatment of Calocane between May 2020 and September 2022.
""Once again, I wish to send my condolences and thoughts to everyone affected by this case,"" he said. ""We will continue to work with our partners in the police and health services to continue to learn.""
Meanwhile, an investigation by the police watchdog has concluded officers following Calocane in the van could not have foreseen he would drive at pedestrians.
The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said its three-month review had not identified any conduct or performance issues in relation to the incident.
Nottinghamshire's police and crime commissioner Caroline Henry said the attacks were a tragedy that no-one could have foreseen.
However, she said she was seeking reassurance from Nottinghamshire Police over outstanding warrants.
She said she was confident the force delivered a good service overall but there was ""always room for improvement"".
By BBC reporter Katie Thompson, at Nottingham Crown Court
For what was a relatively short sentencing hearing, just over 30 minutes, it was no doubt a very long half an hour for the many friends and families of the three victims that filled court one.
There were well over 100 people packed in, and you could hear a pin drop as everyone listened on to the judge's remarks.
Some had their heads bent, some were crying and some had to leave the room.
Calocane stood as his sentence was handed down. A far cry from the bearded mugshot, he was clean-shaven, suited and wearing glasses and stared ahead throughout. His towering figure stood out. He showed no emotion.
Afterwards, people hugged. People sobbed. The red eyes were clear to see.
Then came the family statements outside court. The raw emotion of the words of James Coates, Emma Webber and Sanjoy Kumar was felt by all in the media scrum.

Urfan Sharif, 42, Beinash Batool, 29, and Urfan's brother, Faisal Malik, 28, are accused of killing Sara Sharif, who was found dead at her home in Woking, Surrey, on 10 August.
All three have pleaded not guilty.
A hearing at the Old Bailey on Friday heard the trial will be heard by High Court judge Mr Justice Cavanagh.
The three defendants, who lived with Sara before her death, attended the hearing by video link.
They are also charged with causing or allowing the death of a child, which they all deny.
Judge Mark Lucraft directed the defendants should next appear for a hearing in February, at which the trial date would be finalised.
The trial, which had previously been listed for September, is expected to last for six weeks.
Mr Sharif, Ms Batool and Mr Malik travelled to Islamabad, Pakistan, with Sara's five brothers and sisters on 9 August, the day before her body was found.
A previous court hearing was told police found Sara's body after receiving a call from Pakistan on 10 August.
The three adults were arrested on their return to the UK on 13 September and were charged two days later.
A post-mortem examination found Sara had sustained ""multiple and extensive injuries"" before her death.
However, an inquest heard the actual cause of death had not yet been established.

Shane Frane admitted the manslaughter of PC Philippa Reynolds following a fatal car crash in February 2013.
He was jailed for at least six years in 2014 but has now breached the conditions of a temporary release from jail.
The police have appealed for him to hand himself in.
PC Reynolds was killed when a stolen car driven by Frane crashed into a police car.
The 36-year-old, who is originally from Limerick in the Republic of Ireland, has been missing since 17 January.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has appealed for the public to help find him.
A PSNI spokesperson told BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today ""we are making a direct appeal to Frane to hand himself in"".
The Foyle MP Colum Eastwood said: ""Questions will have to be asked as to how this happened.
""It is a very worrying time I would imagine for Philippa Reynolds' family.
""Anybody that has any information or sees this guy should immediately report it to the police.""
The PSNI said it believed Frane - who is 6ft 3in tall, of medium build, with blue eyes and a left eye disfigurement -  may have travelled to the Republic of Ireland.
He has tattoos on his upper right arm, fair hair and speaks with a southern Irish accent.

Malmesbury Primary School will use the funding to add a new science, technology, engineering, art and maths centre to its site in Wiltshire.
Wiltshire Council had been concerned about what an expansion would mean for neighbouring schools.
Dyson's charity has been looking at the details in the approval documents.
The plans for the centre became controversial when the council said an expansion at one school could affect the future of other nearby primaries.
Then Sir James Dyson wrote to The Times newspaper, describing trying to donate the money as a ""battle"".
Wiltshire Council has said it ""welcomes the contribution to these key areas as a whole"", but council leaders are worried about investment going to one location and what a big influx of new school places would mean for the survival of other nearby schools.
Councillor Laura Mayes, Cabinet Member for Children's Services, explained that while they had a plan for future demand in the area already, ""we now have the government's final decision and we will work with everyone involved to ensure we achieve the best outcomes for all our pupils.""
The expansion would see purpose-built rooms equipped for design, technology, art, science, and mathematics-based activities as well as additional classrooms.
If everything is agreed, including planning permission, it is expected to be open to pupils from September 2027.
The government said there needs to be agreement on how increases in pupil numbers will be managed before building work can start.
Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said: ""This new centre will provide world-class facilities for pupils in Malmesbury and the surrounding areas to inspire them and develop the skills we need to compete on the world stage.""

UCA8HYD5UC_30XFIOYIBQUG48L,Power cuts caused by Storm Isha 'put disabled people at risk',_,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-68062254,"Power outages caused by Storm Isha left a disabled woman who relies on life-saving electrical equipment without electricity for 13 hours.
Michaela Hollywood told the BBC that without her generator she would not have been able to breathe and may not have made it through the night.
Storm Isha has caused electric outages, fallen trees and diverted flights in Northern Ireland on Sunday and Monday.
Wind gusts of 80mph (129km/h) were recorded in County Londonderry.
""As a disabled person, I rely on electricity to live, it's life saving and life maintaining,"" said Ms Hollywood, from Crossgar, County Down.
""It's an essential part of everyday life for me, as much as having a knife and fork is for an ordinary person.
""When we lose power, that all can go down the pan very quickly.""
Ms Hollywood has spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and uses specialist equipment to keep her alive.
She was without power overnight before it returned at about 13:00 GMT.
""I am incredibly lucky to have a generator - that is enough to power my equipment - so it gives a little bit of comfort for me, but that's not the case for others,"" she said.
""No electricity, that obviously puts my life at risk, as well as other disabled people across the United Kingdom, and unfortunately we've been left to make our own crisis plans to make sure our lives are protected.
""For me, it's always about prioritising my equipment and trying to not panic even though you have that deep-seeded feeling of panic, of what are we going to do if this goes wrong?
""It's that fear of maybe not being able to breathe, maybe having to pull an all nighter and not sleep, which is very real and very dangerous.""
Colin Brown's house in Moyallen, County Armagh, narrowly escaped complete destruction after a tree fell into his kitchen.
The evergreen tree, that stood at about 60ft (18.28m) and was about 200 years old, could not withstand the heavy winds from Storm Isha.
""About nine o'clock (at night), me and the wife were just sitting and watching TV and there was a mighty crack and a bang and part of the kitchen ceiling had dropped in but because it was so dark outside I couldn't get out to see what had happened,"" he told BBC News NI.
""I put my head out the patio doors and there was just stuff flying about everywhere.
""A few minutes after that, the electric went off and I thought, 'right that's it, just get the wife and the son out'.""
It wasn't until Monday morning that Mr Brown could see exactly what had happened.
""There's a large hole in the gable wall where the roof is obviously damaged but it's mostly foliage that's lying on top of the roof.""
He added that his insurance gave him the go ahead to remove the tree and the Brown family are hopeful it will be a smooth process.
""The house is OK - we are in the house and we think we are safe enough,"" he said.
""We just have to live here and grin and bear it, but nobody was hurt and that's the main thing.""
Cormac Kelly was hoping to get home to Dublin on Sunday but his flight from Copenhagen took over 12 hours - and he still isn't home.
Mr Kelly's flight attempted to land in Dublin, then diverted to Manchester were they waited on the runway for about five hours before attempting Dublin once more, then Belfast twice.
""It was a disaster - it was very scary,"" he said.
""Everyone was looking at each other. The lights were off. No-one knew what was going to happen as we tried to land.""
The pilot was forced to abort the landing and the plane was sent back towards England, heading first for Newcastle and finally landing in Liverpool.
""Once we got off the plane and got into the airport, a lot of planes were redirected there, it was just carnage,"" he said.
""Everyone on the flight was asking each other, 'What do we do next?' Everyone had the same answer: 'I don't know'.""
He is now in a hotel and has booked another flight home.

UDRZD8J0DM_9CGCTBSCR8VPXUF,Norwich deaths: Police urged not to adopt new 999 policy,By Mariam Issimdar & Nikki Fox,4 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-68085325,"A campaign group has warned more deaths could occur if police go ahead with a new policy of not responding to most 999 mental health calls.
It follows the deaths of two adults and two girls found at a house near Norwich on Friday.
The campaign group said there would be ""consequences"" if the Right Care, Right Person (RCRP) policy was adopted by Norfolk Police.
The government said implementation of RCRP should reflect local needs.
One of the four found dead in the house, Bartlomiej Kuczynski, 45, had dialled 999 at about 06:00 GMT expressing concern about his mental state, and was directed to NHS 111.
Kanticha Sukpengpanao, 36, Jasmin Kuczynska, 12 and Natasha Kuczynska, eight, were found with him at the house in Costessey an hour later after a dog-walker called police.
Post-mortem examinations showed all four died from stab wounds to the neck.
Mark Harrison, of the Campaign to Save Mental Health in Norfolk and Suffolk, said he previously wrote to Norfolk Police objecting, after it announced it would be implementing the RCRP policy from February.
Forces across the country have either adopted or are considering RCRP, saying mental health call-outs required huge resources, and that police officers were not qualified to deal with most mental health situations.
Mr Harrison said: ""We think there will be severe consequences. We think people will die as a result of the introduction of this scheme - and it's not safe.
""It's not been piloted; it's not got any additional resources and it will be a disaster.
""I think immediately it needs to be paused, [then] it needs to be scrapped.
""We need resources at the frontline, in the community services, in the GP surgeries, we also need investment in beds.""
On Tuesday, the NHS Norfolk and Waveney Integrated Care Board (ICB) said RCRP had been developed with health and social care partners ""to ensure mental health, medical or social care issues are dealt with by someone with the right skills, training and experience"". ""It is really important to remember that police will continue to perform their statutory role of keeping people safe,"" it said.
It confirmed no extra funding had been made available as a result of RCRP.
It also said that if there was a perceived threat to life, or risk of serious harm, people could and should continue to call 999.
The Department of Health and Social Care said local implementation of the RCRP plans would ""reflect the needs of local communities, as well as the capacity of local police and mental health services, and any additional resources required"".
""We are investing an extra Â£2.3bn a year in NHS mental health services by March 2024,"" a department spokesperson added.
Norfolk Police has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), in connection with the Costessey case.
On Tuesday, the IOPC revealed a man called 999 from inside the property in Allan Bedford Crescent, on the Queen's Hills estate, and said he was confused and worried about his mental state.
Police forced their way into the house and found the bodies just over an hour later, following a call at 07:00 from a concerned dog-walker.
The IOPC said it would be examining whether the handling of the contact with the caller ""was appropriate and in line with force policy, training and procedures"".
Police said they were treating the deaths of Ms Sukpengpanao and the two girls as murder, but Mr Kuczynski's death as not suspicious.
The force was not seeking anyone else in connection with the deaths, detectives said.

UG796YB4AF_AMAUA1EOSIUSCB9,Post Office scandal: Former postmaster's joy after conviction quashed,By Katie Hunter,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-68067244,"This video can not be played
Cleared sub-postmaster tells his family he is 'free'
A former sub-postmaster wrongly accused of embezzlement during the post office IT scandal has had his conviction overturned.
Rab Thomson, 64, from Alva, wept as he told his sister he had been cleared after a 20-year fight.
Mr Thomson, who was convicted in 2006, is the fifth person in Scotland to have their post office conviction quashed.
The scandal has been described as the most widespread British miscarriage of justice in modern times.
More than 700 post office branch managers across the UK were prosecuted on the basis of a faulty IT system called Horizon, designed by Fujitsu, which made it look like money was missing when it was not.
Mr Thomson took over the post office in Cambus, near Alloa in Clackmannanshire, from his mother Margaret in 1999.
He was prosecuted after a 2004 audit found an apparent shortfall of Â£5,700 and sentenced to 180 hours of community service.
Mr Thomson's mother died before he could officially clear his name.
He told BBC Scotland he felt his exoneration ""would never come,"" adding he felt the worst chapter of his life was now closed.
He said: ""It's been like a noose - the longer it was going on, it seemed to be getting tighter and tighter.
""I never thought this day would come. It's been 20 years, every time we spoke to the lawyers, they were waiting on something else. It did get to the stage that I was just going to throw the towel in.
""But the people who have stuck by me, my family, they all told me it would happen. I only wish my mum was here today to see what has happened.
""Hopefully she is looking down on me and smiling and we'll go and see her up at the graveyard and thank her for everything she has done for us.""
Mr Thomson's case was one of six in Scotland that were referred to the High Court as a potential miscarriage of justice in November 2022.
His appeal was due to be heard on 1 February but the Crown Office decided earlier this week it would not oppose it and he was formally cleared on Wednesday.
A UK-wide inquiry into what happened during the Horizon scandal is under way.
The case was thrust back into the public arena by an ITV drama which followed the scandal being uncovered.
Mr Thomson said it should not have taken 20 years for those wrongly prosecuted to be cleared.
He called on the current Post Office boss, Nick Read, and his predecessor Paula Vennells to formally apologise to those affected by the scandal.
He said: ""If I met the head [of the Post Office] at the moment. I would ask him what he has done for the last 20 years and what have I done in the last 20 years.
""What you see in the inquiry at the moment, it is making your blood boil. It's lie, after lie, after lie.
""I would like the current Post Office boss to come out and apologise. I would like Venells to apologise. Why has it taken an inquiry and a programme to come on the television for us to get answers?""
David Enright, partner with Howe & Co Solicitors, who acts for over 200 postmasters said: ""Although Robert's name has finally been cleared, tragically his mother did not live to see this day.
""We will now be demanding immediate and substantial compensation for Robert, so that he can get back to the life that was stolen from him.
""Although money can never make up for everything that Robert has lost, we will ensure that he is compensated to the fullest extent that he is entitled.""
A Post Office spokesperson said: ""We are deeply sorry for past wrongs and are doing all we can to put these right, including extensive work to support overturning wrongful convictions.
""This work includes assisting the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission and the Crown Office Procurator Fiscal Service, and we continue to work with the UK government to support its efforts to speed up the exoneration of people with wrongful convictions.""

ULE4RNQ7OZ_0DKTA66AP0RYW1K,"Microsoft video games division lays off 1,900 staff",By Tom Richardson,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-68093970,"Almost 2,000 workers in Microsoft's gaming division are to be laid off after its $69bn (Â£54.3bn) merger deal.
A memo from Xbox boss Phil Spencer to workers says the company plans to shed 1,900 of its 22,000 staff.
It was sent three months after the software giant acquired Activision-Blizzard, known for the Call of Duty and Warcraft series.
In the letter, verified as genuine by Microsoft, Mr Spencer says losing staff was a ""painful decision"".
First published by tech website The Verge, the message suggests staff within the Xbox division and at publisher Zenimax - which oversees studios including Bethesda and Arkane - will also be affected.
BBC Newsbeat has asked Microsoft for details of how many employees in each business will be affected.
A second letter, also published by the Verge and verified by Microsoft, was sent to Blizzard staff from Microsoft Studios head Matt Booty.
He said meetings with affected staff would take place throughout the day, with workers outside North America being informed later.
The message also echoed Mr Spencer's, saying the company ""would provide our full support... including severance benefits informed by local employment laws"".
It also confirmed that development on a survival game project widely known as Odyssey had stopped.
Microsoft finally purchased Activision-Blizzard and Candy Crush creator King last September after a series of battles with regulators.
After the deal went through, Activision CEO Bobby Kotick left the company and was not directly replaced.
And in the wake of the latest news, another senior figure at the company announced he was departing.
Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra, who previously worked at Microsoft, said in a statement it had been ""an honour"" to lead the company ""through an incredible time"" and he would return to being its ""biggest fan from the outside"".
The video game industry has been hit by a string of layoffs already this year, following a series of redundancy announcements in 2023.
Earlier this week Riot Games, which makes League of Legends, announced it was shedding 11% of its global workforce.
It followed 1,800 job losses at game engine maker Unity, 500 layoffs at Amazon-owned streaming platform Twitch, and redundancy rounds at smaller studios.
Estimates put the total number of gaming industry job losses last year at more than 10,000, although the true total is thought to be higher.
Experts believe the cost-of-living crisis and the games industry scaling back after a boost from the Covid pandemic have played a large part in the trend.
The wider tech sector also saw big cuts, and Microsoft itself announced 10,000 job losses last January across the wider company, with Amazon, Meta and others also losing staff.
The BBC has asked Microsoft for further comment on the redundancies in its gaming division.

UPVJH6NHRK_3A8ZFVV52VSRKZ2,Derry: Man extradited from US appears on abuse charges,_,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-68071675,"A man extradited from the United States has appeared at Londonderry Magistrates' Court on indecent assault charges dating back to the 1970s.
The 67-year-old, with an address in Massachusetts, cannot be identified to protect the identity of the alleged victim.
He denies 12 charges of indecent assault.
The offences are said to have happened on dates between 13 August 1975 and 16 August 1979.
The man was arrested in the US on the foot of an international warrant and flown back to Northern Ireland.
In court on Tuesday, a police officer said he endorsed the extradition warrants and could connect the accused to the charges.
Defence solicitor Paddy MacDermott told the court that there would be no bail application as a suitable address for his client had not been found.
The police have indicated that if a suitable address is found, they will not be opposing bail, Mr MacDermott added.
He said his client would be denying the charges.
The defendant has been in custody in the US since the end of December and had agreed to his extradition, Mr MacDermott said.
The man was remanded in custody until 29 January for a bail application.
A preliminary enquiry will be held on 13 February, the court was told."
UT504HMCKP_BPRLUSJSPNVW4ID,Ukrainian intelligence does not rule out PoWs on downed Russian plane,"By Sarah Rainsford, in Kharkiv",3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68101731,"This video can not be played
The BBC has verified this video showing the moment a Russian aircraft crashed in the Belgorod region
A representative of Ukrainian defence intelligence has told the BBC that he ""does not exclude"" the possibility there were Ukrainian prisoners on board the Russian military plane that came down in Belgorod.
However, Andriy Yusov stressed that Russia had provided no proof to back its claims there were.
""There is no clear information about prisoners of war. There are only statements by Russia, of a political and propagandist nature,"" he said. ""Who or what was on board needs to be clarified.""
Mr Yusov, who is the first Ukrainian official interviewed by the BBC since the incident on Wednesday, accused Moscow of ""hiding"" information, with limited images from the crash site - including of any dead.
Russia says 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war died when the IL-76 plane was shot down by a Ukrainian missile.
Its investigative committee released a short video this evening, showing blood on the snow, plane wreckage and a large blackened area of ground.
There are some human body parts - but the footage and what it reveals is very limited.
Asked whether it was possible Ukraine had shot down the military plane, Mr Yusov said: ""We do not confirm such information.""
He said both sides were using drones that day over Belgorod: ""There were Ukrainian reconnaissance drones and Russia was launching attack drones.""
""Russian air defence was working against them. Belgorod is also potentially within the range of Ukrainian air defence systems.""
When pushed, he said again there was ""no confirmed information"" that Ukraine had fired at the plane.
He also suggested that what he called a ""friendly fire"" incident by Russia - hitting its own plane - was ""one of the possible scenarios"" that needed looking into.
Mr Yusov said Ukraine had launched a criminal case on the plane incident that would look into all the possibilities.
He stressed the need for an international investigation, with full access to the crash site in Russia and any fragments of plane or any missile - ""in order to rule out all possibilities"".
The intelligence officer did claim that the specific Il-76 aircraft which crashed had been used previously to deliver ammunition and ""missiles for S-300 and S-400 systems"" to the Belgorod region.
We haven't been able to check that.
But such missiles are used in regular deadly strikes on Ukraine, particularly the Kharkiv region near the Russian border. This week, dozens of people have been injured here - and at least 10 killed - when residential buildings were hit.
Mr Yusov added that Ukraine ""can't exclude"" the plane was carrying both people and ammunition.
On the prisoner swap, he confirmed an exchange had been planned on Wednesday ""around lunchtime"". But it was meant to take place in the Sumy region, west of Belgorod.
Mr Yusov refuted Russia's claim that it had warned Ukraine its PoWs would be brought by military plane to the Belgorod region.
He said the two sides implemented a ceasefire in Sumy, as agreed. ""Unfortunately, the exchange did not happen.""
The Ukrainian official said the two sides usually communicate about the routes they will use for prisoner swaps, to ensure safety.
On 3 January, during the previous swap, he said Ukraine was informed that Russia would use a plane.
On Thursday, Ukraine's Air Forces chief stressed that the country had the right to defend itself against attack by Russia and would continue to do so.

UTSBEIBQHO_57EX64GOPRX66R6,Parental leave bill for bereaved passes first stage in Commons,By Shelley Phelps & Sam Francis,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68106038,"Plans to guarantee parents working a new job immediate parental leave if their partner dies in childbirth have cleared the first hurdle in Parliament.
At present, a surviving partner must have worked for 26 weeks and inform their employer three months in advance to be guaranteed parental leave.
Labour MP Chris Elmore has proposed a new law to close this legal ""loophole"".
The government said it supported providing unpaid leave for parents not meeting the 26-week threshold.
Speaking in the Commons, Mr Elmore said his private members' bill would ensure ""more of those left behind have a right to leave in those most horrendous of circumstances"".
The Shared Parental Leave and Pay (Bereavement) Bill seeks to give ""a day-one right to leave for parents in the most tragic of circumstances"" who do not meet the current legal requirement, he said.
Partners must be ""guaranteed leave entitlement to process the grief and change in personal circumstances, along with a job to return to when they are able to do so,"" he added.
""The number of women dying each year during pregnancy or soon after has increased to its highest level in 20 years,"" Mr Elmore told MPs.
There are 13.41 deaths per 100,000 maternities according to latest figures published by the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit - which monitors the causes of maternal deaths, stillbirths and infant deaths.
The government said the bill could help up to 50 people per year, who are denied access to shared parental leave because they have not been in employment long enough.
Aaron Horsey, from Nottingham, found he did not qualify for shared parental leave when his wife, Bernadette, died while giving birth to their son. Tim.
He had recently changed jobs and did not meet continuity of service requirements.
Mr Horsey's new employer agreed to time off, but both had to work hard to understand the law.
""The very fact that I was having to be in those discussions at the same time as looking after Tim and arranging a funeral and being very upset was incredibly difficult"", said Mr Horsey.
He wants the law changed in memory of his wife, who has driven his campaigning efforts.
""It is her voice in the back of my head telling me to keep going and get this change made,"" he said.
The government would support a watered-down version of the bill, removing the pay entitlement for parents who have not worked at a company for 26 weeks, business minister Kevin Hollinrake said.
Mr Hollinrake told MPs no parental leave schemes, including maternity leave, involved employees qualifying for pay from their first day in a new job.
""This is designed to ensure a parent has made a reasonable contribution towards their employer's business before that employer is required to administer statutory parental payments,"" he said.
MPs approved the bill in their first vote on it. But without government support, private members' bills rarely become law.
The bill would cover England, Scotland and Wales but not Northern Ireland where employment law is devolved.

Leicestershire Police said officers were called to a report of an explosion in Kelbrook Close, in Beaumont Leys, at 16:07 GMT on Wednesday.
A man in the property sustained serious injuries and has been taken to hospital.
Police said an investigation was under way and a 32-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life.
Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service is also at the scene and Kelbrook Close and surrounding roads have been closed, with nearby flats evacuated.
A witness at the scene told the BBC: ""The windows of a ground-floor flat have been blown out and there's glass everywhere.
""A guy has been taken away in an ambulance.""
The witness said staff from gas service Cadent were at the scene.
A spokesperson for the company said: ""We are at the scene of this incident to support the emergency services and ensure everything related to gas is safe.
""Whilst it is too early to say what caused the explosion, we do not believe it is related to the gas network.""

UX6WV9XKLX_46ETCH7O1GWT6M3,Jennifer Kiely: Reward of Â£20k offered to help solve 2005 murder,By Rosie Blunt,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-68058672,"A reward of Â£20,000 is being offered for information that could help solve a murder case from 19 years ago.
Jennifer Kiely, 35, was stabbed 16 times and her body set alight before it was found in a seafront shelter in Eastbourne in January 2005.
Crimestoppers, which is offering the reward, is urging potential witnesses to come forward ""whilst being protected by our guarantee of anonymity"".
Sussex Police is hoping to eliminate a man from the investigation.
Described as Eastern European, he was seen the night before Ms Kiely's murder, walking to the rear of the Grand Hotel in Eastbourne.
Police said the man was around 5ft 10-11in (1.5 metres), with a slim to medium build, light blond, short hair and a ""roundish face"".
He was wearing a short, dark, blue jacket with a collar, zipped right up to his chin, as well as grey jeans and white trainers.
Ms Kiely, a mother of three originally from south London, had become estranged from her family following a mental-health breakdown, and had been living in hostels and homeless shelters in southern England.
She often had a pushchair with her and police said this was found on top of her body, also set on fire.
Police said it was likely she was also sexually assaulted.
Sussex Police initially dropped the inquiry in 2007, telling Ms Kiely's inquest there had been insufficient evidence.
The murder inquiry was re-opened in 2011 and since 2017 detectives have been pursuing a line of forensic enquiry relating to unidentified DNA found at the scene.

V16AITZLGR_0JOQQ527DZAF5EH,Japan bomber may have been found after 50 years,By James Gregory,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-68110356,"For decades, the smiling mugshot of Satoshi Kirishima has featured on wanted posters outside police stations across Japan.
After 49 years on the run, authorities think they may have got their man.
A patient at a hospital near Tokyo has claimed he is Kirishima, a member of a militant group behind several deadly bombings in the 1970s.
Police are waiting for DNA tests on the man, who was admitted under a different name suffering terminal cancer.
Kirishima had belonged to the East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front - a radical, left-wing organisation believed to be behind several bombings against companies in Japan's capital between 1972 and 1975.
Eight people were killed in one attack committed by the group at the headquarters of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in 1974.
Japan's National Police Agency says on its website that Kirishima violated ""criminal regulations to control explosives"", and is wanted for ""serial bombings of companies"".
Kirishima is alleged to have help plant and detonate a homemade bomb that destroyed part of a building in Tokyo's Ginza district in one particular attack on 18 April 1975, according to local media.
After 49 years, Kirishma, who would now be 70, may have finally been located.
He initially used a different name when checking into a hospital in Kamakura City in Kanagawa, south of Tokyo.
But he told hospital officials on Thursday he was actually Kirishima, saying he wanted to use his ""real name"" in his final moments as he only has a few months left to live, according to reports.
Police are now carrying out DNA tests to confirm his identity, describing his possible re-emergence as a bolt out of the blue."

In a document obtained by BBC News NI, the council said it is facing an estimated Â£729,000 shortfall in airport funding for the next financial year.
The paper was presented to councillors in a closed meeting.
In a statement, managing director of the airport Steve Fraser said there has been positive engagement between the airport, elected representatives and government departments.
""In all cases, the economic and strategic importance of the airport for the north west region is recognised. We fully expect when ministers return to Stormont that the airport business case will be addressed,"" he added.
It is understood the behind-closed-doors meeting at council was to discuss financial challenges ahead of striking the district rate for 2024/25.
In the paper, council officials were told that the estimated amount needed for the airport in the next financial year was Â£3.75m.
""While these figures are estimated at this point, it is clear that council funding will only be sufficient to sustain the airport up to a maximum of January 2025,"" the paper said.
""This will become a critical financial consideration by Spring 2024.""
In 2021, the council submitted a business case to Stormont for Â£3m a year over a six-year period to help reduce the burden on ratepayers. The document said that an initial Â£3m was secured in 2022/23.
In October last year, the council wrote to the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) requesting further funding to help meet the airport's annual running costs.
In reply, the DfI's permanent secretary Dr Denis McMahon said it was unlikely to provide further funding for the airport this year because of the ongoing financial challenges at Stormont.
In a statement to BBC News NI on Friday, a spokesperson for the DfI said: ""The department confirmed to the council in December that funding would not be provided in 2023/24.
""The department also advised that the issue of funding for City Of Derry Airport is a cross cutting one that requires executive consideration.
""The most recent funding provided by the department in relation to the airport was Â£3m covering the period 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 under a ministerial direction.
""A ministerial direction was required as the accounting officer had concerns regarding the affordability, value for money and regularity of the expenditure.""
Meanwhile, BBC News NI has also learned that another Stormont department has still not decided if funding for daily flights between City of Derry Airport and London Heathrow will be renewed after March.
The route, which is operated by Loganair, is widely regarded as one of the most important air links at the council-owned airport, as it connects the north west of Northern Ireland with the rest of the UK.
It is jointly funded by the Department for the Economy (DfE) in Northern Ireland and the Department of Transport in London under what is known as a public service obligation (PSO).
A PSO is intended to support regional economic development.
A spokesperson for DfE told BBC News NI: ""At this time, the department does not know its budget beyond March 2024.
""It is therefore not possible to allocate funding for 2024/25 at this stage.
""The department is currently planning for the 2024/25 budget year and will be bidding for the Â£1.018m required for the Public Service Obligation.
""The department will endeavour to update all stakeholders as soon as it can.""
A UK government spokesperson said funding for airports in Northern Ireland is a devolved matter which rests with the Department for Infrastructure.
""The government supports restoring a locally elected, accountable and effective devolved government as soon as possible to address issues facing Northern Ireland.""
A council spokesperson said they are engaging with City of Derry Airport on a regular basis and with the relevant departments at the Northern Ireland Executive, the UK Government and Irish Government.
They said they regularly discuss current funding challenges and ""the urgent need for financial support required to retain the connectivity benefits [the airport] provides across the north west region"".
""Included in those discussions are requests for funding for the continuation of the PSO route from London beyond the existing two-year contract; a funding package from government over a six-year period towards the overall operating cost of the airport and also a commitment from North-South Ministerial Council to prioritise a Dublin PSO service.""
The council said it recognises the strategic importance of the airport to the city and region and is doing everything possible to secure the necessary funding.

V42QR71DW5_8RSZCW6BUR3M0EB,Rwanda asylum scheme: Peers vote against approving Rwanda treaty,By Sam Francis & Harry Farley,5 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68059862,"In the first vote of its kind, the House of Lords has called for the new UK-Rwanda treaty to be delayed until Kigali improves its asylum procedures.
Peers backed a non-binding motion urging the government not to ratify the treaty, by 214 votes to 171.
The treaty, signed in December, is central to Rishi Sunak's scheme to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda but is separate to the Rwanda Safety Bill.
Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron urged his fellow peers to back the bill.
""It's not acceptable to have people travelling from a perfectly safe country - France - to another safe country - Britain - and to be able to stay, and that's what the Rwanda plan is all about,"" he said.
In a news conference last week, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak urged the House of Lords not to block the ""will of the people"" by voting down the bill.
Next week peers will begin debating the proposed legislation which aims to prevent legal challenges to deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda.
While non-binding, the vote on the treaty gives an indication of the level of opposition Mr Sunak is likely to face when the bill is debated in the Lords.
But only one Conservative - the Earl of Dundee - rebelled against the government in Monday night's vote.
The vote was the first to be held under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 - which set out new methods for the Lords to reject treaty ratification.
Once the Rwanda Bill is passed, the treaty will officially be ratified - though the government does not need the backing of parliament to approve the treaty.
The UK-Rwanda Treaty forms a central plank of the government's plan to deter migrants from crossing the Channel in small boats.
The treaty was drafted in response to the Supreme Court ruling that the Rwanda policy is unlawful.
Home Secretary James Cleverly signed the new legally binding treaty in Kigali, which he said would ensure people relocated to Rwanda are not at risk of being returned to a country where their life or freedom would be threatened - a process known as non-refoulement.
The treaty also establishes a new appeal body, which will be made up of judges with asylum expertise from a range of countries, to hear individual cases.
The government says Rwanda's asylum system would be monitored by an independent committee, whose powers to enforce the treaty would be beefed up.
The Monitoring Committee will develop a system which will enable relocated people and their lawyers to lodge complaints, the government says.
But the House of Lords backed a motion on Monday saying the treaty should wait until the government is able to prove Rwanda is safe.
The motion was proposed by a Labour former Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, on behalf of the cross-party International Agreements Committee which listed 10 outstanding issues in the Rwandan asylum system.
The committee published a report last week that argued protections promised by the Rwanda Treaty, have not yet been introduced.
Lord Goldsmith said: ""The government has already presented a Bill to Parliament asking it to make a judgment that Rwanda is safe now.
""And yet on the home secretary's own evidence it cannot be so because the measures are not in place and have not been shown to be effective,
The Liberal Democrat spokesperson Lord Fox added: ""There is more than enough reason to delay the ratification of the treaty until the conditions for its lawful operation are actually in place.""
Although the vote is not binding on the government, it could feature in future legal challenges against the policy.

V4HT3DO0MU_OVTSSNNEHN1CVGQ,Horizon scandal: Call to end Fujitsu's Welsh government contracts,By Gwyn Loader,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-68098621,"A former sub-postmaster wrongly jailed in the Horizon scandal has called for the Welsh government to terminate its contracts with Fujitsu.
Hundreds of sub-postmasters were prosecuted when the faulty Horizon computer system wrongly showed money missing from Post Office branches.
Fujitsu, which developed and operated Horizon, has apologised for its role in the scandal.
Former sub-postmaster Noel Thomas, from Anglesey, was one of those jailed.
He was locked up in 2006 after being given legal advice to plead guilty to false accounting.
Three years ago his conviction was overturned.
Now Newyddion S4C has found millions of pounds of Welsh taxpayers' cash has been been spent on Fujitsu contracts since the High Court brought the company's failings to light.
It ruled in 2019 Horizon was faulty, and had led to wrongful prosecutions by the Post Office.
Mr Thomas said he wanted Welsh public contracts with Fujitsu terminated.
The Welsh government confirmed it was the contracting authority for two contracts for Transport for Wales (TfW) ticketing systems, worth more Â£2m, which were awarded in August 2022.
That was almost a year-and-a-half after Mr Thomas and 38 others had their names cleared at the High Court in London.
Mr Thomas said he was ""disappointed"" Fujitsu had been given more contracts.
He said he wanted Fujitsu's contracts terminated ""after all the bother they've caused, which for me has lasted 20 years"".
He added: ""Why have they gone down this road? Fujitsu seem to have contracts everywhere.
""It is surprising these contracts are still in place.""
Fujitsu said it was suspending bidding for UK public contracts until after the public inquiry into the scandal had ended.
It has not answered the question of whether this includes Welsh government contracts.
In Westminster, the Commons Treasury Committee has written to 21 public bodies asking for details of any contracts with Fujitsu since December 2019.
According to Tussell.com current UK public contracts with Fujitsu are worth Â£6.8bn.
The Welsh government was asked if Fujitsu would be allowed to bid to have contracts renewed when they expire in July.
It said: ""Legislation makes it possible for public sector buyers to exclude a bidder from a procurement process if they are considered to be subject to one or more exclusion grounds as laid out in the legislation.""
A contract worth Â£1m a year between Fujitsu and TfW, was extended for two years in April last year without a tender process.
TfW is a Welsh government-owned not-for-profit company.
It told Newyddion S4C extending the contract without giving other companies the opportunity to bid for it ""was deemed to be more cost effective than replacing the existing hardware"".
The Welsh government said: ""This is an operational contract for Transport for Wales in which Welsh government has no involvement.""
Plaid Cymru transport spokeswoman Delyth Jewell said: ""This is public money. I'd like to see more diligence and a review into how those contracts have been awarded.
""I think many people in Wales would say it is morally questionable whether a company which has played such a crucial role in destroying people's lives should be a fit and proper company to be getting public money.""
Fujitsu said offered its ""deepest apologies"" to sub-postmasters and their families.
""The UK statutory public inquiry, to which our UK subsidiary is providing full cooperation, is examining complex events that have unfolded over many years, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to this cooperation.
""Based on the findings of the inquiry, we will also be working with the UK government on the appropriate actions, including contribution to compensation.
""The Fujitsu Group hopes for a swift resolution that ensures a just outcome for the victims.""

VDJRKZSRMC_B0O0UXP6TYK81KR,Boeing 737-900ER: Second model to be inspected after 737 Max 9 blowout,By Sean Seddon,7 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68052160,"This video can not be played
Watch: On board flight during mid-air blow out
Checks are to be carried out on a second Boeing aircraft model following the blowout of an unused door on one of its planes earlier this month.
The US Federal Aviation Administration grounded more than 170 of the 737 Max 9 fleet after a cabin panel broke away thousands of feet above the ground.
On Sunday, the agency said airlines should also inspect older 737-900ER models, which use the same door design.
The FAA described the move as an ""added layer of safety"".
It said there had been no reported issues with the 737-900ER, but that it uses the same style of panel to ""plug"" an unused door as the plane involved in the terrifying 5 January incident.
An Alaska Airlines flight en route to California from Portland, Oregon was forced to make an emergency landing after the panel came away, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the aircraft.
The incident prompted the FAA to ground all 737 Max 9s featuring that style of panel and sent Boeing's share price tumbling.
The agency is investigating the firm's manufacturing practices and production lines, including those linked to subcontractor Spirit AeroSystems, which provided the panel.
Earlier this week, the FAA said it had carried out inspections on 40 of the grounded planes but did not say when they would be able to fly again.
In a statement on Sunday, the agency said: ""The safety of the flying public, not speed, will determine the timeline for returning these aircraft to service.""
Boeing has said it will increase the quality of inspections in its manufacturing process in wake of the incident.
The 737-900ER models have carried out 11 million hours of operations without similar incident to the newer 737 Max 9s.
The FAA did not order the older model to be grounded while the visual inspections are carried out by operators.

Nicholas Rossi spent more than two years fighting the case claiming to be an Irish orphan called Arthur Knight.
Judge Derek Pullan, of Utah's Fourth District Court, was told Rossi would not appear by video link from prison on Monday.
A new date of 6 February has been set for his appearance.
Judge Pullan told the court that if Rossi was not ill then he would ""authorise reasonable force to compel his attendance"".
The 36-year-old previously appeared by video link at the Third District Court in Utah last Tuesday.
He was arrested under an international arrest warrant in December 2021 after being admitted to hospital in Glasgow with Covid.
He claimed to have been the victim of mistaken identity and insisted his name was Arthur Knight.
But in November 2022 a sheriff in Edinburgh ruled that he was Nicholas Rossi after hearing that his tattoos and fingerprints matched.
He lost his final appeal against extradition on 14 December last year.
Prosecutors in Utah said he was charged with raping a 21-year-old woman in 2008.
Rossi was not identified as a suspect until about a decade later due to a backlog of DNA test kits at the state's crime lab.
During the previous hearing, he denied being Nicholas Rossi and said his name was Arthur Knight Brown."
VKLX44IFRQ_CVAED2RST30IGHP,Mia Janin took own life after bullying - inquest,Guy Lynn,26 January 2024,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn0nd1gnj4lo,"This video can not be played
Mia Janin: 'Iâm preparing myself to get bullied tomorrow'
An inquest has concluded that north London schoolgirl Mia Janin took her own life after being bullied by boys at her school.
Coroner Tony Murphy found the 14-year-old died ""while still a child and while still in the process of maturing into adulthoodâ.
While the inquest was taking place, Mia's family released a WhatsApp voice note to BBC London to highlight her sheer despair after months of relentless bullying from peers at the Jewish Free School (JFS) in Kenton.
Mia sent the voice note to a friend on 10th March 2021, the night before she returned to school.
In it, she said: ""Tomorrowâs going to be a rough day, Iâm taking deep breaths in and out. Iâm currently mentally preparing myself to get bullied tomorrow.""
Speaking after the conclusion of the inquest at Barnet Coroner's Court, her father Mariano Janin said he had been seeking answers about what happened to Mia for almost three years.
""My daughter experienced prolonged and sustained bullying in various ways in person and online,"" he said.
""In a way itâs a relief this has now been recognised, however there does need to be accountability. Another family cannot live what I have lived.""
Mr Janin added: ""We need to put some limits on the access of the kids on the internet and how we can recollect the data if something like this has happened.
""We need to create a safe environment for our kids.""
Mariano Janin said his daughter Mia slightly struggled to integrate but was adored by her close friends
Mia, who was in Year 10, had a small, tight-knit group of friends at JFS, where she had been a pupil for three years.
Rabbi Howard Cohen, former deputy head teacher at JFS, told the inquest that after Miaâs death there was âsome talk around the schoolâ of what he described as âboys-only bravado groupsâ sharing images of girls.
He also said he was made aware of a boysâ WhatsApp group in which members were rating the âattractivenessâ of female pupils.
He told the inquest he held a meeting with members of one of the group chats, who then agreed to disband it.
Mr Janin said ""school is not only for the curriculum"" but it needs to promote ""clear values"" in order to respect one another and have a better society.
""Iâm not a specialist,"" he said. ""I have experience with whatâs happened to Mia.
""I think the school has to be more vigilant, they need more young people to understand all this social media, all this technology.""
He added: ""Iâm a victim of this failing system. We need to learn from our mistakes in order to avoid this happening again.""
Mia was born in 2006 and was a huge fan of art, cheerleading and looking after her dog, Lola.
She loved dressing up and make up. Her friends described her as someone who was slightly unusual and offbeat, who preferred hanging out with small groups of people who knew her well.
Yasmin Bliss first met Mia at the age of 10 and used to go cheerleading with her.
She recalls Mia as ""being like no-one else I know. She lit up every room.""
The 14-year-old experienced bullying at school and online
Mia's friend Yasmin Bliss remembers her as a vivacious, loving person
The inquest heard Mia's parents had several times raised concerns with JFS staff that Mia was feeling lonely and isolated.
Yet Mr Janin said neither he nor his wife had any idea of the true extent of what his daughter had been going through.
The day after Mia returned to school after lockdown was lifted, Mia's mother Marisa discovered her lifeless body in her bathroom at the family home in Harrow.
Mr Janin said: ""Suddenly I heard a horrible scream from my wife. This time everything stopped for me and my wife. Life changed completely.""
In statements to the inquest, Miaâs friends said their JFS friendship group was nicknamed the ""suicide squad"" in the months before Mia's death.
They also told police one of Miaâs TikTok videos was shared to a Snapchat group, created by male pupils at JFS, where they mocked her.
Another child reported the boys used the group chat to share faked nude photos of the girls.
""Kids were manipulating images of girls. And Mia was one of them. And took it very badly,"" Mr Janin said.
Coroner Mr Murphy said at the inquest there was no evidence images or video about Mia were circulated in the group, except for that TikTok video.
JFS has said it only knew about the group after Mia's death. When Mia died in 2021, she was the third child suicide at the school in five years.
Mariano Janin says he and his wife were worried about bullying of his daughter
Until now, none of Mia's friends from JFS has spoken out publicly about the bullying that took place at the school when Mia was there.
Martha Gentely, who has since left the school, was Mia's best friend at JFS. She recalls that their small friendship group was picked on at the time, but said what happened to Mia ""was to a different extent"".
""When weâd speak about it, it was all our experiences. Mia was very headstrong: 'I donât care'.â
Ms Gentely, who describes the bullying as ""relentless"", says she was also harassed in the street by people who would be ""making funâ and that she received constant abuse on social media.
At the inquest, Mr Murphy said Mia had had ""close friends, including at her secondary school, but she also experienced bullying from some male studentsâ. He said Mia's teachers had not been aware of this bullying.
Current JFS head teacher David Moody said changes had been made.
""We will continue to do everything we can to embed all of the changes that have been put in place over the last three years,"" Dr Moody said.
""Mia remains a hugely missed member of our school community and our thoughts continue to be with the family.""
Mia took her own life in March 2021
The inquest had sought to determine Miaâs wellbeing; her interactions with students and staff at JFS and the support she received relating to that; and what happened in the two days before her death.
The school told a pre-inquest review it accepted that ""it was Miaâs experience that she was being bulliedâ.
Dr Moody previously told the BBC: ""Like the family, the school is waiting for the findings of the external investigations to be published and we hope that the publication will be as soon as possible.""
He added Ofsted inspectors were ""pleased with the sustained changes"" enacted by both governors and the new leadership team.
In its most recent inspection in April, JFS was rated ""Good"" across the board by Ofsted, as revealed in the inspection report, which was published last week. It had previously been rated ""Inadequate"".
The school has been approached for further comment. The coroner said he would let the legal representatives know at a later time if he would be issuing a prevention of future deaths report.
Mia's mother Marisa Janin died from an illness four months after her daughter took her own life
Mr Janin said he spends his days trying to find answers about the circumstances that led up to Mia's death, to piece together clues - and that includes social media.
He and numerous charities have called for social media firms to be required by law to hand over data that could help parents in his position find answers.
The Online Safety Act, which become law in October, aims to give coroners and bereaved parents easier access to social media data.
Four months after Mia's death, Mr Janin experienced another tragedy: his wife and Mia's mother, Marisa, died after an aneurysm and contracting leukaemia.
""Iâm still alive, physically, I have a heartbeat - but in other ways, my life is gone,"" he says.
""I will never see my beautiful daughter grow up. I will never meet her kids, her grandchildren. Thereâs no future for me, thereâs no future.""

A passer-by caught the moment of the theft on their mobile phone
A thief who smashed a shop window to steal three bottles of gin only escaped with a cocktail of water and vinegar.
The man was filmed smashing the glass display at York Gin, in the city centre, on 23 January and reaching inside for the drinks.
Those who work at the shop, on Pavement, said he must have missed the sign reading: ""All display bottles contain water.""
Police appealed for anyone with information to get in touch.
Staff said the window had been decorated with painted hearts ahead of the upcoming York Residents' Festival.
Jenny O'Hara-McRandal, York Gin head of retail, said: ""Two of our main windows have been broken, they thought they had stolen gin - none of our gin on the shop floor is real.""
She continued: ""It made me feel disappointed because the whole point of the residents' weekend is about love for the city.
""In that moment I didn't really feel love.""
She concluded: ""It could have been a lot worse, but it is a little bit of a gut punch really.
""I had been in since 06:30 in the morning on Monday putting the 'I love York' windows in, so all the hard work had been destroyed.""
The firm, located in a 16th Century building, said the smashed glass will take time to replace and will not be ready for the weekend event.
North Yorkshire Police said the theft took place at about 23:00 GMT.
A force spokesman said: ""Officers are asking members of the public to get in touch if they recognise the person in the footage as they believe they will have information that will help the investigation.
""Although the person's face cannot be seen in this footage, they are hoping someone may recognise them from their movements or clothing.""

VVAV1WBJGB_23SE0BMC9PE8W4X,Brexit: Badenoch says the UK can diverge from EU rules,By John Campbell,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-68098115,"Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch has said the UK will retain the ability to diverge from EU rules.
It comes after a report that the government will voluntarily limit divergence as part of a deal aimed at restoring devolution in NI.
Such a move would help minimise post-Brexit trade barriers between NI and the rest of the UK.
Speaking in the House of Commons, Ms Badenoch did not deny that such a policy was being considered.
Northern Ireland has remained inside inside the EU's single market for goods while the rest of the UK has left.
That means there is free-flowing trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
However, new checks and controls are required on some goods coming from Great Britain - what is known as the Irish Sea border.
At the point Great Britain left the single market it had the same rules as the EU but over time divergence is likely to occur as the two sides update their rules.
Growing divergence could potentially increase the level of controls on goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland and require businesses to make changes to their processes.
The Daily Telegraph has reported that the UK government is offering to introduce a new requirement that all new laws are ""screened"" to ensure they will not create extra trade barriers.
The newspaper said it would mean all legislation would have to accompanied by a ministerial statement confirming it did not have a ""significant adverse impact"" on internal UK trade.
The offer could form part of a package aimed at getting the DUP to end its boycott of devolved government over the impact of the sea border.
In the Commons, the former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers asked Ms Badenoch if she was ""in a position to deny a report in the Telegraph today that the government has pledged to introduce a requirement that all future regulatory law change will be screened to ensure that they don't create extra trade barriers in the Irish Sea?""
Ms Badenoch said she could not comment on the NI political process as she was not involved in it.
She added: ""What I will say is that we retain the ability to diverge, that is clear, and I do agree with her that if we are really to seize the benefits of Brexit we need to find that comparative advantage in our regulations with the EU, otherwise there would be no point.""

VZ9RNTX2E3_KZN5LN7Z47R555S,Emma Caldwell murder trial hears accused thoroughly cleaned van,_,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-68094001,"A former neighbour of the man accused of killing Emma Caldwell has told a court she saw him ""thoroughly"" cleaning his work van around the time she died.
Elayne McAllister said she recalled joking to Iain Packer that he was doing such a ""good job"" that she would get him to do her kitchen next.
On another occasion she said he seemed ""unsettled"" when talking about the van being forensically examined.
Mr Packer denies killing Ms Caldwell and 46 charges against 27 other women.
He is also facing charges relating to three men and a teenage boy.
He is accused of killing 27-year-old Miss Caldwell at Limefield Woods in Biggar, South Lanarkshire on 5 April 2005.
Ms McAllister, 55, told the High Court in Glasgow how she had previously lived beside 51-year-old Mr Packer in East Kilbride, Lanarkshire.
Photographs of the sign-fitter's work van - which she said was ""almost always dirty and untidy"" - were shown to the jurors.
Prosecutor Richard Goddard KC asked the witness about an occasion she is said to have seen Mr Packer clean the van.
Ms McAllister said: ""The van was totally empty. The tools were out...he was using soapy water, bleach, cleaning agents, giving it a good scrub.""
She said she had spoken to him, saying: ""Something along the lines of that he was doing a good job and that did he want to do my kitchen when he was finished?""
She said it was April/May time as the weather was dry and confirmed that it was the first time she had seen Mr Packer thoroughly cleaning his vehicle.
Ms McAllister said that at some stage Mr Packer also told her the van had been ""taken away for forensic examination"".
When asked what his manner was like, she replied: ""Matter of fact. He appeared a bit nervous. He kind of fidgeted.""
Mr Goddard referred her to a police statement she gave in 2020 in which she said Mr Packer was ""unsettled, nervous, fidgety and hopping from foot to foot.""
In cross examination, Packer's KC Ronnie Renucci put to the witness that she had made no mention to police of any van cleaning being in April/May time.
Miss McAllister said: ""It felt like Easter time because of the weather. It was 19 years ago.""
The defence advocate suggested the woman had never seen Mr Packer clean his van, but she denied that.
Mr Packer denies strangling Ms Caldwell in the remote woods near Biggar in 2005 and concealing her body.
The murder charge alleges he assaulted Ms Caldwell by restraining her, grabbing her wrists and strangling her with his hands and a cable.
He is then said to have dumped her naked body in the woods as well as disposing of her clothes, phone and other personal belongings.
He is also alleged to have cleaned a car to ""avoid detection, arrest and prosecution"".

The scientist - who was born in Ipswich - had been appointed as principal of the genetics department at the university's medical school in 1973.
Harrisson, a retired research scientist, was apprehended in the hours after the murder in 1978.

Police forced entry to Harrisson's home after the case was reinvestigated
But it was decided there was insufficient evidence to take him to court.
Then, 37 years after the killing, Police Scotland were instructed to reinvestigate in 2015.
Semen found on a duvet in Dr Page's flat in Allan Street matched her former husband's DNA profile and was said by forensic expert to be 590 million times more likely to be from him than another male.
Harrisson was arrested in 2020 and was last year found guilty of the murder, 45 years after the killing.
He was jailed for life and ordered to serve at least 20 years before he can apply for parole.
A new BBC documentary - Murder Trial: The Killing of Dr Brenda Page - this week examines the case at the High Court in Aberdeen.
It captures the moment officers forced entry to his home, as he told them: ""She wasn't murdered here"".
The first episode of Murder Trial: The Killing of Dr Brenda Page will be broadcast on the BBC Scotland channel at 22:00 on Tuesday and on BBC Two on Thursday at 21:00. It will be available on BBC iPlayer from Tuesday.

W0EQE88HN5_NM6UU863U9QYM0H,Are Tory MPs plotting to get rid of Rishi Sunak?,By Chris Mason,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68081397,"An opinion poll paid for by a previously unheard of group of unidentified Conservatives, the Conservative Britain Alliance.
A poll talked up and worked on by Tory peer Lord Frost, a long-standing critic of Rishi Sunak.
A poll timed and in its questioning framed, it would appear, to inflict maximum damage on the prime minister - published just as MPs were contemplating how to vote on the government's Rwanda plan.
The three biggest rebellions of Mr Sunak's premiership on proposed changes to that migrant plan and then a shrivelled rebellion of 11 on rejecting the plan in its entirety.
Next, yet another grouping of Conservative agitators, calling themselves ""Popular Conservatism"".
What could they possibly be comparing themselves to? Among their number the former Prime Minister Liz Truss, and yes, you guessed it, Sir Simon Clarke.
And now the latest twist, Sir Simon's devastating public critique of the prime minister, coming a sufficient number of days later that it can capture the political agenda, and not merely become a sidebar to last week's noise.
The argument Sir Simon is making is the poll suggests the Conservatives would be better off with another Conservative leader willing to be more robust on immigration and tax cuts.
It is worth noting, as Patrick English from YouGov, the polling company that carried out the work acknowledged on the Today programme on Radio 4 this morning, the answers to this kind of questioning ""comes with a huge amount of caveats"" - as those polled are being asked to pick between existing leaders - such as Labour's Sir Keir Starmer - and a hypothetical one a voter can build in the image that they choose in their own mind.
But Sir Simon is making the argument nonetheless; his allies making a slightly broader case that it at least suggests Mr Sunak is now a drain on Conservative support, less popular than his party, rather than the opposite.
The question now is what happens next.
All of this is a symptom of the central issue: privately Conservative MPs fear they are going to lose, and perhaps lose big time.
Most, for now at least, have decided the only thing that can do is plod on - attempt to demonstrate steady competence, point to a steadily improving economy and progress on illegal immigration, for instance.
Others, a clump of the not just doom-laden but downright disaffected, are so convinced of the party's imminent possible oblivion that they feel compelled to act now.
Sir Simon is one of them, but he's not alone.
There are parallel processes here, one private, the other public.
If 53 Conservative MPs privately write to Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, there would be a vote of confidence in the prime minister.
A vote, incidentally, he would be likely to win - itself a factor in shaping how some Conservative MPs behave - for why provoke a vote of confidence in order to replace the leader if the likely outcome is a huge public row but no actual change at the top?
We don't know and Conservative MPs can't even be certain how many letters have been submitted.
It is a never-ending parlour game at Westminster, best short-circuited like this: there aren't enough letters until we know that there are, when Sir Graham announces the threshold has been met.
Until then, there is talk of letters, talk of letters being written, talk of letters being sent, talk of letters being withdrawn. Lots of talk, next to no facts.
Some talk of a handful of letters, some talk of a dozen, some talk of more. Only Sir Graham knows for certain.
Then there is the public argument, which is often and is certainly in this case behind the private one.
The public argument provokes yet another spat that is very visible - with the potential that could tempt some more MPs to follow suit. Or it could persuade others that is a terrible idea.
Let's see how many others are willing to break cover.
So, are MPs plotting to get rid of Mr Sunak?
That word ""plot"", beloved of journalists, often obscures and exaggerates more than it enlightens - better, I think, to set out the facts as we know them and you can come to your own conclusion.
Is there coordinated, even if loose in parts, stewing, conversations, anxiety about what, if anything, Conservative MPs should do next? Yes.
What happens next? Well, the perennial question.
And here's the perennial answer: I'm trying to find out and I'll let you know what we turn up.

W1HS0NQRQ0_WU84VCUE8QCPSOH,Navy Seals presumed dead after anti-Houthi mission,By Kathryn Armstrong,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68053528,"Two US Navy Seals who went missing during an operation to seize Iranian-made weapons - bound for Houthis in Yemen - are now presumed dead, the US military says.
The incident took place on 11 January when commandos were boarding a ship off the coast of Somalia.
According to media reports, one was swept away and the second jumped in to save him.
US Central Command said attempts were being made to recover the bodies.
""We mourn the loss of our two Naval Special Warfare warriors, and we will forever honour their sacrifice and example,"" said the head of Central Command (Centcom), Gen Michael Erik Kurilla.
The US Navy identified the two as 27-year-old Navy Special Warfare Operator 2nd Class Nathan Gage Ingram and 37-year-old Navy Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Christopher J Chambers.
Air and naval units from the US, Japan and Spain spent 10 days searching an area of more than 21,000 sq miles (54,000 sq km) to try to find the commandos, with the help of oceanographers and meteorologists.
Navy Seals are members of a specialist maritime military force responsible for tasks including reconnaissance and carrying out covert operations.
""These Seals represented the very best of our country, pledging their lives to protect their fellow Americans,"" US President Joe Biden said in a statement on Monday.
""Our hearts go out to the family members, loved ones, friends, and shipmates who are grieving for these two brave Americans.""
Military officials told the Associated Press the first Seal, Ingram, was swept into heavy seas during the night mission as they were boarding an unflagged dhow - a traditional sailing ship - where the weapons were discovered.
The second, Chambers, entered the water to try to save him.
Capt Blake L Chaney, commander of Naval Special Warfare Group 1, said in a statement that the two Navy Seals ""were exceptional warriors, cherished teammates, and dear friends to many within the Naval Special Warfare community"".
""Chris and Gage selflessly served their country with unwavering professionalism and exceptional capabilities,"" Capt Chaney said.
Centcom said last week that warheads for Houthi medium-range ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles, as well as parts for air defence systems, were among the items seized.
It added that initial analysis indicated the components were for missiles that have been used by the Iran-backed Houthis to target vessels travelling through the Red Sea recently.
The supply, sale and transfer of weapons to the Houthis is considered a violation of a 2015 United Nations Security Council resolution, as well as international law.
Dozens of vessels have been targeted in the Houthi attacks, leading hundreds of cargo ships and tankers to be rerouted around the southern tip of Africa to avoid the strikes.
The Houthis, who support Hamas, say they are only targeting vessels with connections to Israel following the start of the war in Gaza. However, some of the ships they have hit have had no clear connection to Israel.
They have also begun attacking ships associated with the US and UK after both countries launched airstrikes against Houthi positions in Yemen in retaliation to the Red Sea attacks. The group controls the country's north, the capital Sanaa and the Red Sea coastline.
Both the US and UK say they are not seeking a conflict with the Houthis but are trying to protect the international trade route.

W2GIV7OZ8P_O17JSTS7EANLR5S,Kenya court blocks police deployment to Haiti,By Ian Wafula,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-68090488,"The Kenyan High Court has blocked the government from deploying police officers to fight gangs in Haiti.
The judge argued that the deployment would be illegal as the National Security Council lacks the legal authority to send police outside Kenya.
He added that the council can only deploy military, not police, for peacekeeping missions such as Haiti.
Last year, Kenya had volunteered to lead a multinational security force in Haiti to quell gang violence.
The judge further explained that Kenyan law only allows the government to deploy police officers to another country if a reciprocal agreement exists between Kenya and the host nation.
Kenya's government has said it will appeal against the ruling.
Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry last year asked the UN to urgently deploy a multinational force.
He said his government had been overwhelmed by gangs who controlled 80% of the capital, Port-au-Prince.
The UN Security Council backed Kenya's offer to lead the force and Kenyan lawmakers went on to approve the deployment.
In Haiti, the possible deployment had received mixed reactions from community members who have suffered at the hands of gangs.
Laurent Uwumuremyi, the country director of Mercy Corps, told the BBC the mission had the potential to facilitate access to public infrastructure and address the humanitarian crisis.
He added though that some community members said Haiti did not need external interventions and that they saw it as a waste of money and time.
Ekuru Aukot, the Kenyan opposition leader who brought the case, said the court ruling was a win for the country, which could not afford to spare officers before tackling its own security challenges.
Mr Aukot added that President William Ruto was only using the deployment to prop up his international image and seek favour with Western countries like the US.
President Ruto said Kenya had an ""impressive record"" of participating in peace support missions around the world.
He added that the deployment would enable officers to improve and sharpen their skills and experience in providing security.
However, the suitability of Kenyan police for the deployment had raised concerns over possible human rights violations.
Nicole Widdersheim, deputy Washington director at Human Rights Watch, told the BBC they had documented Kenyan police violence, including murders, going back to 2013.
She added that there has been a long history of international armed intervention in Haiti really doing ""a lot of terrible things"".
The Kenyan government has denied any allegations of human rights violations by its officers.
One police officer who had already received two months of intensive training said he was ""demoralised"" by the ruling.
""I was prepared to go. I wanted to see how other police officers are doing their work and to add on to my experience.""
But he said he would use the training ""to serve here in Kenya"".
This is the second major court ruling to go against Kenya's government on the same day. The High Court also rejected a government attempt to overturn a block on a controversial housing levy.
It comes after Mr Ruto had recently criticised judges he said were corrupt for blocking government policy.

W5SL3MVEX0_5OO5BKE8WOOAB9W,Hoarding: Woman embarrassed to have visitors,By Shazia Ali & Catriona Aitken,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-68091271,"A woman whose hoarding habit has left her too embarrassed to have visitors says it is like a ""dark secret"".
Rosemary says while she sometimes feels she will never be able to overcome the condition, she has hope as she has been receiving treatment to discover the root of the problem.
It comes as a Welsh taskforce calls for hoarding to be better understood as a mental health condition.
Some renters face court ordered possession clearances due to hoarding.
""It's a sad secret,"" said Rosemary, from south Wales. ""You're hiding that side of yourself from everyone else.
""There are very few people who have actually been in my home and, if they have, they've only been in one tiny part of it.  I feel quite embarrassed. I don't like people seeing the chaos.""
She said she did not know what caused her condition, but suspected it may have stemmed from her parents giving away her belongings without her knowledge when she was a child and a turbulent 10 years of moving home many times, or a symptom of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
She described her living room as being ""completely inaccessible"".
""It's piled high with boxes and bags from the floor, almost to the ceiling, and there is very little room to move in there at all,"" she said.
At one point, Rosemary was paying about Â£200 a month for storage space, before managing to lessen the ""junk"" to a point where it fitted in her home.
""You think 'am I ever going to get through this?'. And sometimes that can make me feel quite tearful and despondent, just feeling as though I'm never going to actually overcome this,"" she said.
She added that dozens of thoughts ""race"" through her head each time she attempts to sort things out.
""Let's say it's a plastic container which I no longer need,"" she said.
""So I'm looking at the container and immediately I'm thinking 'somebody made this, somebody manufactured it, it's got a use'.""
She then described wondering what she could do with it, such as taking it to a charity shop, adding: ""I wonder if they could use it at a school? It would be so sad if it ends up in in the dump. It'll just not disintegrate for 200 years and that's so sad.""
Recently, she has been tackling the issue by considering the root of the problem, an approach she says has brought her a lot of hope for the future.
She hopes to have made enough progress by her next birthday to be able to invite friends over for a tea party.
""Though well-meaning friends or family members would love to swoop in and clear the lot, you always feel like you're under threat of clearance,"" she said.
""It's not how I want to live. It's not how I perceive myself to be. In fact, I like to be organised and actually like being neat and tidy. It sounds so contradictory, but I don't enjoy having the clutter around me, so it's very frustrating.
""I wish I could just wave a magic wand and make it all go away but, because I can see incremental progress, it's finally given me some hope.""
Hoarding experts have joined forces with psychologists, the fire service, and social housing, to protect people from losing their homes when they breach safety rules due to the condition.
As a homeowner, Rosemary is not at risk of losing her property. But, in some circumstances, hoarding can lead to a breach of tenancy if a safety risk is posed.
Landlords and housing associations can seek court orders to compel tenants to remove their possessions or become evicted from the property.
Kayley Hyman, director of hoarding training and consultancy service Holistic Hoarding, said hoarding needed to be ""back on a par with all the other mental health conditions"".
Holistic Hoarding has worked on more than 200 cases of hoarding, and prevented 50 evictions and 17 children from going into care.
The team considers the causes of hoarding before they begin clearing away any possessions.
""There's this perception you can fix it in a day if you chuck it all out,"" said Ms Hyman.
""Unfortunately that is not how it works. We work for up to two years with a lot of our clients. It's not a quick fix.""
She added court ordered collections exacerbate the issue, with 97% of their clients who had this imposed upon them relapsing.
Kevin Smith, 49, from Caerphilly, received support from Holistic Hoarding after being subject to seven collections.
""Having someone come in and clear your space is stressful and invasive and, without the right support, it can cause your anxiety to significantly worsen,"" he said.
""Forced clearances are the worst. I had no control over what was happening, and I relapsed five times, at great financial cost.
""It simply doesn't work.""
Mr Smith now runs a peer-led support group to help other hoarders experiencing what he did.
A study published by the National Association of Social Workers found that when agencies focused on clearances, 55% of cases showed no change and 8% got worse.
The taskforce has achieved the support of Caerphilly and Newport councils.
Ms Hyman said: ""Rather than [having] disparate voices with very valid concerns, [it's about] bringing them together and uniting all of these services, who all want the same thingâ¦the person to be safe.""
Housing association United Welsh signed the taskforce's first ""no evictions"" policy, which promised eviction notices would not be sent to tenants who were seeking support for their condition.
Craig Singler, director of housing and communities, said the team ""believe a sensitive, empathetic approach to supporting people who hoard is the right thing to do"".
""This starts with building relationships with residents, so we can have honest conversations and work together... to tackle safety issues,"" he said, adding that ""keeping people safe and able to continue living in their home"" should be the priority, with court action seen as a ""last resort"".

W8M2EBGB42_JFBECC3OOFVF2HQ,Masters of the Air: The story behind the Apple TV drama,By Brian Farmer,3 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-68093138,"The story of a group of American World War Two airmen is about to be told in a television drama series featuring Hollywood star Austin Butler. But in a corner of the East Anglian countryside, where the group's B-17s began bombing raids on Nazi Germany, the men of ""Bloody Hundredth"" have long been celebrated.
Villagers in Thorpe Abbotts, Norfolk, realised more than 40 years ago that the young Americans who arrived on their doorsteps in June 1943 should not be forgotten.
Volunteers set up the 100th Bomb Group Memorial Museum in 1983.
Over the years, the museum has attracted thousands of visitors, including 100th Bomb Group veterans and their relatives, who have donated artefacts for displays.
But many more people will now learn about the exploits of the crews of the 100th Bomb Group for the first time when Masters of the Air, whose executive producers include director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks, airs on Apple TV on Friday.
Museum trustees have seen previews of Masters of the Air and expect the series to generate much more interest in the 100th and boost visitor numbers.
""In the 1970s we became concerned that what had happened in Thorpe Abbotts was in danger of being forgotten,"" explained Reg Wilson, the chair the 100th Bomb Group Museum trustees.
""A group of like-minded people got together and looked at creating some kind of memorial.
""The museum opened in 1983. Veterans came over from the United States for the opening.
""The aim was to remember these men and tell people what they did. The TV series will obviously tell their story to a much bigger audience.""
He added: ""I've seen a premiere and I was pleased with what I saw.
""The basic story is true. The characters were real people.""
An American online military history tells how, in June 1942, the US Army Air Force activated the 100th, nearly three years after the outbreak of war.
Crews trained in Idaho and Utah, but their legend was born after they arrived at Thorpe Abbots airfield a year later.
Before June 1943 was out, crews had flown their first combat mission - and before long the group had been nicknamed the ""Bloody Hundredth"", because of the losses suffered.
""The [group] experienced several instances where it lost 12 of 13, or 13 of 15 aircraft on one mission,"" explains the United States Air Force's (USAF) online history.
""Just two months after entering the war, the group received its first Distinguished Unit Citation for its attack on the German aircraft factory at Regensburg on August 17 1943.
""The (group) lost nine crews on that raid alone.""
Seven B-17s were missing in action after an attack on Bremen, the history explains.
Six out of 18 bombers had to abort over the North Sea during an attack on Munster.
Crews flew their last combat mission on 20 April 1945.
""During the 22 months that some 7,000 men and a few women of the 100th Bomb Group operated out of Thorpe Abbotts, the group flew 306 missions,"" adds the USAF history.
""The Air Force credited them with 8,630 sorties; dropped more than 19,257 tons of bombs plus 435 tons of food on humanitarian missions.""
A feature on the Imperial War Museum (IWM) website also tells the story of the 100th.
""The 100th Bomb Group is one of the most famous of World War Two,"" says the feature.
""The 100th was among an armada of American bomber and fighter groups to arrive in England to bolster the flagging formations of the Eighth Air Force. Eighth Air Force Bomber Command became the Eighth Air Force in February 1944 and oversaw the bombardment of strategic targets throughout Europe until 1945.""
IWM curator Dr Hattie Hearn adds: ""On the morning of 25th June 1943, B-17s of the 100th Bomb Group went to war for the first time.
""The target was the heavily defended submarine pens at Bremen in north-west Germany.
""This would not be a milk run.
""As the formation passed north of the Frisian Islands, three B-17s became lost in the heavy cloud cover and fell prey to prowling Luftwaffe fighters.
""The 100th had been in the air for a matter of hours and had already lost 30 men.
""It was the start of a legacy that would earn the bomb group the nickname the 'Bloody Hundredth'.""
The 100th lives on and is based in East Anglia.
In 1992, the unit returned to England, as the 100th Air Refueling Wing, to a new base at RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk.
American servicemen and women from the modern day 100th recently joined volunteers to watch a preview of Masters of the Air, some of which was filmed in the old town in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, at RAF Mildenhall.
Museum volunteers say several 100th veterans - former air and ground crew members - are still alive.
Former pilot John ""Lucky"" Luckadoo was the last to visit Thorpe Abbotts, in October at the age of 101.
""You have to remember, these were very young men who flew these missions,"" said Mr Wilson.
""Some few many missions while still in their teens.
""When we think of the problems we have in our daily lives, it's really difficult to comprehend what they had to face, and what they did.""

WK3UY5N9MP_JB7NZP70ERV2POK,"Terminally ill man discharged without care package, wife says",By Julian Fowler & Amy Murray,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-68097871,"The wife of a terminally ill man has said he was discharged from a Belfast hospital without a care package in place.
Ray Bass, 67, has been told he has just a few weeks to live.
He was treated at the Royal Victoria Hospital, in the Belfast Trust area, but lives in the Western Health Trust area.
The Belfast Trust said it does not have control over how long it takes to secure care outside their area.
The Western Trust, which covers Ballinamallard, County Fermanagh, where Mr Bass lives, apologised for any distress caused.
A care package has now been put in place but Mr Bass' wife Shelley told BBC News NI that she expected one to be ready after he returned home from hospital on Monday.
""I'm reeling. I'm losing the man that I love and now I'm having to sort all these things out as well,"" said Mrs Bass.
""I shouldn't need to have to nurse my husband when I'm trying to get over the fact that I'm going to lose him in a couple of weeks.""
The Belfast Trust said that if a patient lives outside its area and a care package is needed then ""a referral is then made to their trust area"".
The statement continued: ""We do not have control over the length of time it may take to secure services outside of our trust area and we regularly liaise with other trusts regarding progress of a patient's care package.""
It added that the Belfast Trust will ""always endeavour to work with families to ensure appropriate care arrangements are in place before discharge, however, we respect the wishes of patients and their families"".
The Western Trust said that discharge planning takes place in the trust in which the patient is being cared for but that when neighbouring trusts are involved, a care package referral is made and ""discussions will take place on availability of care and ability to meet these within a certain timeframe"".
""Hospital and community teams continue to work extremely hard under unprecedented pressures to ensure that patients and their families receive the most appropriate support and care in a timely manner,"" it said.
Mr Bass first became ill in November 2023 with what his wife described as ""a bad back"".
After a series of hospital visits and blood tests, he was told he had terminal pancreatic cancer that had spread to his bones and fractured his spine.
He was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast - but the couple was told he had just a few weeks to live and he came home on Monday.
Mrs Bass told BBC News NI that she was told a care package would be sorted, including carers four times a day.
A hospital bed was sent to their house in Ballinamallard but the care package did not materialise, said Mrs Bass, adding that district nurses and palliative care nurses who came to treat her husband told her they were not aware that a package had been put in place.
When they realised Mr Bass was immobile, she said they told her they were not sure if any care packages would be available in County Fermanagh.
""Even the doctor said they didn't think we could get someone four times a day. It didn't really help to be told that.
""They're lovely people. I don't want to make it out like they were not trying but I was left not knowing what was going on.""
Mrs Bass said she was not shown how to use the equipment that had been delivered and was also told she would have to buy some equipment herself.
""To be told the NHS no longer provides you with bedpans, and have to go to Amazon to have one delivered - that's not right,"" she said.
Mrs Bass added that the cancer charity Macmillan advised her to take her husband to a hospice.
""Fermanagh is a long way from the nearest hospice and he doesn't want me not to be there,"" she added.
Mrs Bass then said she was told to ask her neighbours if they knew of any carers who could help.
After a post on social media, she received multiple offers of help. The care package has also now been put in place for Mr Bass.
However, his wife said he feels let down by the NHS.
""He's had to process this and also worry about me,"" she said.
""My back is now broken from trying to move him in the bed and he's in agony.""
She added: ""Individual people are trying their best to do things but the system is broken.""

WK6JE2SMOK_GBS9WM52AP4M5XD,British man acquitted over London-Spain flight bomb hoax,By Sam Hancock,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68099669,"A Spanish court has cleared a British man of public disorder, after he joked to friends about blowing up a flight from London Gatwick to Menorca.
Aditya Verma admitted he told friends in July 2022: ""On my way to blow up the plane. I'm a member of the Taliban.""
But he said he had made the joke in a private Snapchat group and never intended to ""cause public distress"".
A judge in Madrid ruled that ""no explosive... was found that would lead one to believe it was a real threat"".
Mr Verma's trial, held at the National Court in the Spanish capital, took place on Monday - a year-and-a-half after the incident took place.
The message he sent to friends, before boarding the plane, went on to be picked up by UK security services. They then flagged it to Spanish authorities while the easyJet plane was still in the air.
Two Spanish F-18 fighter jets were sent to flank the aircraft. One followed the plane until it landed at Menorca, where the plane was searched.
Mr Verma, who was 18 at the time, was arrested and held in a Spanish police cell for two days. He was later released on bail.
A judge ruled earlier that Mr Verma, of Orpington, Kent, should be cleared of any wrongdoing.
If he had been found guilty, the university student faced a fine of up to â¬22,500 (Â£19,300) and a further â¬95,000 in expenses to cover the cost of the jets being scrambled.
A key question in the case was how the message got out, considering Snapchat is an encrypted app.
One theory, raised in the trial, was that it could have been intercepted via Gatwick's Wi-Fi network. But a spokesperson for the airport told BBC News that its network ""does not have that capability"".
In the judge's resolution, cited by the Europa Press news agency, it was said that the message, ""for unknown reasons, was captured by the security mechanisms of England when the plane was flying over French airspace"".
The message was made ""in a strictly private environment between the accused and his friends with whom he flew, through a private group to which only they have access, so the accused could not even remotely assume... that the joke he played on his friends could be intercepted or detected by the British services, nor by third parties other than his friends who received the message,"" the judgement added.
It was not immediately clear how UK authorities were alerted to the message, with the judge noting ""they were not the subject of evidence in this trial"".
A spokesperson for Snapchat said the social media platform would not ""comment on what's happened in this individual case"".
On its website, in a section titled ""How We Work with Law Enforcement Authorities"", Snapchat says one of its goals is to ""maintain a safe and fun environment where Snapchatters are free to express themselves and stay in touch with their real friends"".
It adds: ""We also work to proactively escalate to law enforcement any content appearing to involve imminent threats to life, such as school shooting threats, bomb threats and missing persons cases, and respond to law enforcement's emergency requests for disclosure of data when law enforcement is handling a case involving an imminent threat to life.
""In the case of emergency disclosure requests from law enforcement, our 24/7 team usually responds within 30 minutes.""

Mia Janin, a pupil at the Jewish Free School (JFS) in Kenton, north-west London, was found dead at her family home in Harrow in March 2021.
Her father, Mariano Janin, has said he believes she was cyber-bullied.
Statements given by Mia's friends to the Met Police following her death were read to the inquest.
Barnet Coroner's Court heard evidence that Mia was bullied at school and their friendship group was nicknamed the ""suicide squad"" in the months leading up to her death.
They said that one of Mia's TikToks was shared to a Snapchat group chat run by male pupils at JFS, where they made fun of her.
One child said the boys used the group chat to share nude photos of girls.
The child added: ""They took screenshots of girls' faces on social media and made fun of them. They shared a video of Mia's TikTok and made fun of her.""
They said the boys also photoshopped girls' faces onto the bodies of pornography performers.
The child said that they had a conversation with Mia the day before she died, when Mia asked: ""If you died would people care about you the next day?""
""We laughed it off, that was all she said, it was just in normal conversation,"" the child said.
Another child said that the TikTok video had been posted by Mia the night before she returned to school after the end of Covid restrictions.
The child said that Mia had received lots of negative comments on the TikTok video from other pupils at JFS.
""Mia said she was fine, but I don't think that she was fine,"" she said.
Mr Janin told the inquest that his daughter asked if she could move school after coming home after her first day back.
The inquest heard that his wife Marisa, who has since died, told Mia she could be homeschooled for the rest of the school year, and that they would look into moving her to a new school after.
Mia then went to bed. Hours later, she was dead.
Area coroner Tony Murphy said that there was no evidence that any images or videos involving Mia had been shared in the group chat, except for the TikTok.
The inquest heard that Rabbi Cohen, former deputy headteacher at JFS, told the boys to close down the group after Mia's death.
JFS's position is that the school was not aware of the existence of the group chat before Mia's death.

WUOX0OB14D_TZ03VNU1Y3GMA49,North Sea oil and gas claims fact-checked,By Mark Poynting,5 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-67945281,"The government has been defending a plan that could see new licences granted every year for fossil fuel drilling in the North Sea.
In a debate in the House of Commons, it claimed it would be cleaner than importing oil and gas from overseas and would help the UK's energy security. Critics say it would damage the UK's reputation on climate action.
We've examined some of the claims.
Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho told MPs: ""Gas that we bring in from abroad through LNG has four times higher emissions.""
Liquified natural gas (LNG) is gas that is compressed into liquid form and shipped in, rather than pumped through pipelines.
She is right to say emissions from UK gas production are indeed roughly four times lower than imported LNG, according to figures cited by the North Sea Transition Authority, the UK's oil and gas regulator.
But most of the UK's gas imports are typically not LNG, rather they are pumped in via pipelines from Norway, according to government data.
And Norway's gas is on average much cleaner than the UK's.
These figures only relate to what's known as the ""production phase"" - just the greenhouse gases emitted from getting oil and gas out of the ground.
Total emissions from oil and gas come mainly from using these fossil fuels.
Claire Coutinho also told MPs: ""Our bill will improve our energy security.""
While the UK is heavily reliant on oil and gas imports, there's no guarantee that extra domestic production would stay in the UK, especially when it comes to oil.
This is because it is extracted by private companies, who sell it on the open international market, rather than necessarily to the UK.
For this reason - and because some oil can't be refined in the UK - around 80% of the oil produced in the North Sea is actually exported.
Most of UK North Sea gas is pumped directly into the UK network, but some is then exported to Europe, for example to be stored for winter, according to Dr Simon Cran-McGreehin, head of analysis at the ECIU, an independent energy and climate think tank.
Amanda Solloway, a minister in the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, confirmed in December that there were no plans to force private companies to allocate oil and gas in the North Sea for domestic use.
Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband said: ""the legislation we are considering today won't cut bills"".
He is right. Oil and gas prices in the UK are determined by global energy prices.
""No amount of UK North Sea oil and gas will turn the dial on international prices, because our volumes are so small, and because everything is run through markets,"" Dr Cran-McGreehin says.
Defending the plan on BBC Breakfast on 6 November 2023, Claire Coutinho admitted: ""It wouldn't necessarily bring energy bills down"".
But she claimed it would raise a significant amount of money in tax revenue to help fund public services.
The government's independent climate advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), argue that the best way to reduce the reliance on imports and lower bills is to boost renewables and other low carbon technologies to reduce the demand for fossil fuels in the first place.
Over the past decade, the government has made progress in boosting UK's renewable electricity generation - from 7% of the total in 2010 to over 40% last year.
Claire Coutinho also said: ""Even the Climate Change Committee's own data shows that when we reach net zero in 2050, we'll still be using oil and gas.""
It is true that the UK will still use some oil (mainly for aviation) and gas (mainly for electricity and fuel supply) in 2050, as the chart below from the CCC confirms.
This is the date by which the UK has pledged to reach net zero - the point where the UK no longer adds to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, by removing as much as it emits.
But UK demand for oil and gas needs to fall 80% by 2050 for the UK to meet its targets, the CCC says.
In particular, it says there will be much less need for oil - which makes up most of the remaining North Sea reserves - as cars, trains and buses switch away from petrol and diesel.
For this reason, the CCC has distanced itself from the idea that it backs new UK oil and gas.
Prof Piers Forster, the interim chair of the CCC, tweeted in response to the proposed legislation that further oil and gas licensing was ""inconsistent with climate goals"".
This is because countries agreed to transition away from fossil fuels at the last year's COP28 climate summit. Some fossil fuels need to be kept in the ground to have a chance of limiting warming to globally agreed levels, says Rebecca Willis, a professor of energy and climate governance at Lancaster University.
The International Energy Agency has previously said there is no need for investment in new oil and gas projects to meet global energy demand.

WVOXLA7Q89_0QPSXTA5NVX95BT,Badenoch blames Biden for missing post-Brexit trade targets,By Simon Jack,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68069994,"The Business Secretary has blamed a change in US president for the UK's failure to hit post-Brexit trade targets.
Kemi Badenoch told MPs Joe Biden's administration had no appetite for trade deals.
She claimed it was why the government missed a manifesto pledge to strike deals with countries that account for 80% of UK trade by the end of 2022.
The UK has free trade agreements covering 60% of overseas trade.
Appearing before MPs on Tuesday, Ms Badenoch said: ""The biggest thing that had an impact on us reaching that goal was the change in administration from President Trump to President Biden.
""The Biden administration decided it was not doing trade deals - with anyone not just us.""
She noted that the US had moved to specific smaller deals in areas like semiconductors and critical minerals. That produced a change in her own strategy, Ms Badenoch said, causing her ""to pivot away"" from free trade agreements and instead focusing on smaller Memorandums of Understanding which she conceded were not based on enforceable international law.
But the Business Trade Secretary said she remained confident that the UK would reach a target of hitting Â£1 trillion in exports by 2030.
Liam Byrne, chair of the Business and Trade Select Committee, noted that the Institute of Directors business group had estimated that meeting that goal would require export growth of 3.5% per year.
That compares to a current forecast of 0.1% growth by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent fiscal watchdog.
Faced with questions on the UK's membership of a wider Trans-Pacific Partnership, known as CPTPP, Ms Badenoch refused to be drawn on whether Britain would support China or Taiwan joining the trade bloc.
It currently includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. The UK already currently has trade deals with nine of the 11 members.
The OBR estimates that membership of the CPTPP trade bloc would boost UK economic growth by 0.04% over the next 15 years.
It has also estimated that the UK's departure from the EU single market and customs union would mean the UK economy being 4% smaller than it would have been if the UK had not left.
Ms Badenoch stopped short of saying the OBR was ""wrong"" but said while the government took account of the OBR's estimates, it thought its estimates were vulnerable to changing economic circumstances and outcomes.

Former sub-postmistress Heather Earley took Â£50,000 out of her pension to pay the Post Office
A sub-postmistress who was one of hundreds caught up in the Post Office scandal has said she would rather have her money back than have an apology.
Heather Earley was wrongly accused of owing thousands of pounds.
She was one of those caught up in the scandal after faulty software wrongly calculated that money was missing from post office branches.
The Newtownabbey woman used Â£50,000 of her pension to cover huge shortfalls that were caused by the faulty system.
When Post Office chief executive Nick Read came to Northern Ireland in 2023 to apologise to Ms Earley, she told him she would rather have her money back.
She is one of 555 sub-postmasters who won a landmark case against the Post Office in 2019.
It agreed to pay them Â£58m in compensation, but much of the money was swallowed up by legal fees.
Although campaigners won the right to have their cases reconsidered, as of 15 January 2024, only 95 convictions had been overturned.
Ms Earley opened a shop and Post Office in Mossley, County Antrim, in 2011 but her new business venture soon turned into a nightmare.
""Because I was told it was my problem, I was just lifting money out of the till of the shop and putting it into the Post Office,"" she said.
One of Ms Earley's customers repeatedly exploited a flaw in the system which saw her cash withdrawals credited as deposits in her account.
The woman was later convicted but the glitch left Ms Earley  with a Â£10,000 shortfall.
""I went back to the Post Office and I said: 'Can I have my Â£10,000 back please?'
""And they said: ""No, that was your problem not ours'.""
With shortfalls appearing each week, because of Post Office's Horizon IT system, Ms Earley was forced to cash in Â£50,000 of her pension to cover losses.
She was eventually forced to close her post office in 2017 and later her shop.
""When the inquiry [into the scandal] started to come up I couldn't go back to work, I just felt so panicky. I was taking panic attacks,"" she said
""I've now been diagnosed with PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder], depression, anxiety, things that I would never have had in my lifetime ever.""
Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted 700 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses based on data from faulty Horizon software.
Another 283 cases were brought by other bodies including the Crown Prosecution Service.
Ms Earley and a number of other former sub-postmasters and mistresses received an apology from Mr Read when he travelled to Northern Ireland.
She said she ""didn't want his apology"".
""I want my money back.  Someone has my money, where is it? I'd like it back,"" she said.
""I have suffered so much and my family have suffered so much.""
She gave evidence to the Post Office Inquiry when it held hearings in Northern Ireland in 2022.
The inquiry began in 2021 and resumed earlier in January after breaking for Christmas.
On Friday, a former Post Office employee who investigated her case is due to give evidence in London.
She plans to attend the hearing along with a number of former sub-postmistresses from Northern Ireland.
""The sorry thing is it took a TV drama for all this to come to a head,"" she said.
""The Post Office have treated us like dirt, it's time that we get treated properly and that we get listened to because we haven't been listened to all these years.""
The ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office brought the scandal into the living rooms of millions of people across the UK.
Owen Fearon has not been able to watch more than a few minutes of it and yet he knows the story inside out, it is his story too.
Mr Fearon said that with three young children and a busy corner shop in the County Armagh village of Meigh, ""life was brilliant"".
But things started to go wrong after he took on the lease for the Post Office in 2002.
""From day one, there would be shortages,"" he said.
""You kept ringing the Post Office helpline, it was no use.
""They told us 'it was your fault'.""
One cold January morning in 2006, the Post Office auditor arrived, the total bill Mr Fearon was told he ""owed"" the Post Office was Â£16,500.
At a meeting at the Post Office HQ in Belfast, Mr Fearon was told he would have to pay it back or he would be sent to jail.
He borrowed the money and paid it back, but it had a profound impact on his life.
""Now I know what they did, it was total blackmail,"" he said.
""It was blackmail then and it has now been proven to be blackmail.
""We were told by the Post Office 'it was you and only you'.""
Stories began to emerge in the mid 2010s, and then a Panorama programme in 2015 led Mr Fearon to contact the Post Office and challenge them on his case.
""They sent me an offer of compensation which to me, it was very, very small, for what they put me through,"" he added.
""Remember they were going to jail me, they were going to bankrupt me, they were going to put my wife and three children out of the house and on the street, they didn't care.
""When I disputed the compensation, they sent me back a letter - they wanted to see my medical records.""
So what happens next?
""I'd love some guy from the Post Office to lift the phone, ring me and apologise for attempting to send me to jail,"" Mr Fearon said.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced the government will bring in a new law to ""swiftly"" exonerate and compensate victims.
The law will not automatically apply in Northern Ireland or Scotland, but Downing Street is ""keen"" to extend the provisions.
The courts system in Northern Ireland is different from England and Wales.
Although the government has promised to overturn sub-postmasters' convictions, Mr Fearon was never convicted and so his name cannot be officially cleared.
""It is totally unfair, the fact that myself and loads of other postmasters may have got the money from somewhere to pay it off, we're the forgotten ones in one sense,"" Mr Fearon said.
""I would dare say there are hundreds who are still keeping quiet, those who have taken compensation, minimal as it is, are probably keeping quiet.
""I would suggest they come forward now and tell their story.""
And as for the programme which ignited public anger at this scandal?
""No, I can't watch it,"" Mr Fearon said.
""I put it on for several minutes but it just takes everything back.
""It was a total miscarriage of justice.""

X4W3C30RBL_974UF2BAP0DVD48,Brett Saunders admits helping run child sex abuse site,By Rhiannon Yhnell,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-68054575,"A man has admitted being a ""global moderator"" on a dark web site dedicated to the sharing of child sexual abuse content.
The National Crime Agency (NCA) investigated Brett Saunders, from Swindon, in connection with the site which had more than 2,000 members.
They found a message saying he saw his role in helping share abusive photos and videos as an ""honour"".
Some of the content was ""horrific"" said a senior officer.
NCA Branch Commander Adam Priestley said: ""Brett Saunders was directly responsible for facilitating the sexual abuse of children.
""He became part of a global community of paedophiles to further his own sexual interest in children and his dedication to this platform was such that he was appointed as a moderator.""
Saunders, 50, was arrested at his home in the Freshbrook area in August 2022, and a number of devices seized, including a hard drive hidden in an air vent.
The dark web site was open on his laptop and Saunders was logged into his account.
When interviewed by officers he admitted holding the rank of ""global moderator"" and that he had personally uploaded indecent images of children to the site.
Investigators discovered Saunders had previous convictions related to the sexual exploitation of children, the NCA said.
Analysing his account, they found more than 3,000 posts made by him along with private messages he sent to other users, showing his contribution was key to keeping the website running.
""The posts showed Saunders had quickly risen through the ranks due to his commitment and encouragement of others to discuss and distribute images and videos of child sexual abuse,"" the NCA added.
When another use congratulated Saunders on his promotion to global moderator he said it was an ""honour"" and that he would ""try to keep doing it to the best of my abilities"".
Saunders uploaded a total of 115 images and videos of abuse to the site. A further 65,000 files relating to indecent images of children were recovered from his devices.
Mr Priestly added: ""The site hosted horrific videos, images and discussions on child abuse, some of which Saunders posted himself or actively encouraged others to do so.
""He did this brazenly, clearly assuming he was protected by the dark web.""
After his arrest, Wiltshire Police charged Saunders with breaching a sexual harm prevention order that had been placed on him when he was released from prison for his previous offending.
For that offence he was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison for the breach.
Later, in 2023, he was charged with a further nine counts, including arranging and facilitating the sexual exploitation of a child under 13, participating in the criminal activities of an organised crime group, distributing and making indecent images of children in categories A-C, and possessing a prohibited image of a child.
Saunders pleaded guilty to all of the new charges at Swindon Magistrates Court on 19 January.
He will be sentenced at Swindon Crown Court on 5 March.

The court ordered that his detention be extended until 30 March which means the Wall Street Journal reporter will spend over one year behind bars as he awaits trial.
Mr Gershkovich, his newspaper, and the US deny the espionage charges.
US officials have called for his immediate release.
""The grounds for Evan's detention are baseless,"" the American embassy in Moscow tweeted on Friday. ""Journalism is not a crime.  We continue to call for Evan's immediate release.""
His arrest marked the first time Moscow had accused a US journalist of espionage since the Soviet era.
Mr Gershkovich was arrested in the city of Yekaterinburg, about 1,600km (1,000 miles) east of Moscow, while reporting on the war in Ukraine on 29 March.
It is the fourth time his detention has been extended and as a result he will continue to be held in Moscow's Lefortovo prison.  Mr Gershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison if found guilty.
A video of the hearing, posted on the Moscow court system's Telegram channel, confirms the two-month pre-trial extension and shows Mr Gershkovich listening to the proceedings while wearing jeans and hoodie.
The closed hearing on Friday was attended by US consulate officials, including United States Consul General Stuart Wilson, according to then Associated Press.
Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the US and Russia were discussing Mr Gershkovich's possible release, and were working to find a ""mutually acceptable"" outcome.
""It seems to me that on the whole we're speaking in a language which we both understand,"" he said.
Russian officials have previously suggested that they are open to a prisoner swap with the US, but only after a trial is concluded.

The US government has designated the reporter as being ""wrongfully detained"", a status which requires it to work to free him.
Former US Marine Paul Whelan, who is currently serving a 16-year sentence in Russia for spying, is also considered wrongfully detained. Last year, he told the BBC that he felt ""abandoned"" by his own country.
In October 2023, a journalist with both American and Russian citizenship was detained while visiting her family.
Alsu Kurmasheva, who works for US-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, is accused of failing to register as a foreign agent and is facing a jail term of up to 15 years.

XGNL84U9X6_LINQAGU714FMB3R,Thailand: Reformist leader Pita overcomes first court hurdle,By Frances Mao & Jonathan Head,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-68078182,"Thailand's reformist political champion will be re-instated as an MP after winning a trial his supporters say was aimed at ending his political career.
The Harvard-educated Pita Limjaroenrat and his Move Forward party won the most votes in a huge election win last year.
But he failed to take charge after being blocked by the unelected Senate.
The charismatic young leader was seen as a threat to the establishment for promising to reform harsh royal insult laws and to tackle military influence.
While negotiating to form a coalition government after his election victory, two court cases were lodged against him. His supporters saw this as part of a wider campaign by conservative political forces to oust him from politics and discredit his party's ideas.
On Wednesday he was acquitted in the first case against him, but he faces a potentially more serious legal challenge next week.
The Constitutional Court will rule again, this time on whether his plan to reform Thailand's harsh lese majeste law amounted to an attempt to ""overthrow the democratic regime of government with the king as the head of state"".
A verdict finding that Move Forward acted unconstitutionally in this way could lead to it being dissolved, and its leadership being banned from politics.
In 2019 the court dissolved Move Forward's previous incarnation Future Forward, after it too had done better than expected in an election. That verdict sparked off months of street protests and unprecedented public criticism of the monarchy.
On Wednesday Pita's supporters cheered outside the Constitutional Court  when they heard he had won his case, chanting ""PM Pita"".
""It was Pita himself who told us that we have to live with hope,""  Luksikarn Tangchotithanavid, 40, told the BBC.
""Our generation can read and understand the law. We know what is written and how it should be executed. According to the law, he should not be disqualified in this case.""
Mr Pita was acquitted of violating election law by owning shares in a media company while contesting last year's election.
He had been suspended as an MP last July over the allegations and banned from sitting in parliament, forcing him to give up leadership of his party.
His defence has been that he inherited the shares from his father, but that the company had not been operating for many years, long before he ran  for office. A majority of judges agreed with him in their ruling on Wednesday.
""Holding the shares did not violate the law. The court has ruled his MP status has not ended,"" Judge Punya Udchachon said.
Before the verdict, Mr Pita also told reporters he would keep fighting for the reforms his party had promised.
As well as amending the lese majeste law these include breaking up business monopolies and limiting  the military's influence in politics and business. This platform proved very popular in the 2023 election, giving Move Forward 151 of the 500 seats in parliament, more than any other party.
""No matter the result I will still be working for the people,"" he said on Wednesday before the verdict. ""[This court case] is only a detour. Regardless of the verdict we will continue fighting.""
Thailand under King Maha Vajiralongkorn has seen a significant increase in the use of lese majeste laws to silence political critics. More than 260 people have been charged under the law since November 2020.
Last week, a 30-year-old man was sentenced to 50 years in jail for comments that were ruled to have defamed the Thai monarchy. This was the most severe sentence ever handed down under the country's notorious lese majeste laws.

XIS50YGD6K_EIG6FL91YJ57OHF,'Shock' as victim's family quoted Â£22k for rape trial transcript,By Rachel Stonehouse,6 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-68033275,"A mother who was quoted Â£22,000 for a transcript of her daughter's rape trial says she is ""shocked"" at the cost.
Julie and her daughter Megan, from Gloucestershire, wanted access to the transcription after being advised against attending the whole trial.
The defendant was found not guilty of rape in 2023 and the family wanted to know what was said in court.
The government plans to pilot free access to sentencing remarks but only when the accused is found guilty.
The women in this article have been given pseudonyms to protect their anonymity.
Julie said: ""She can't function now, she's in such a state. I decided to find out about how much it'd cost to get the court transcript and the quote was Â£22,000.""
She had assumed a transcript would be free, and said she was ""shocked and horrified"" at the figure.
The proposed pilot, which will be discussed in the House of Lords on Wednesday, will only include cases where there is a guilty verdict and not where someone is found not guilty.
""Because transcripts are so expensive people are left â¦ they can't move on, they can't heal because they want to know what happened in their case,"" added Julie.
She is part of the Open Justice Campaign to improve the experience of victims in court cases.
Part of this includes access to a written or audio record of what happened in court for free, better information for when a victim can attend a trial after giving evidence and better support for victims.
Although courts are open to the public, victims are sometimes advised, or choose not to attend certain parts which they could find distressing.
Violet, from Berkshire, went through a five-week trial. The accused was cleared of rape.
She was told the transcripts would cost more than Â£30,000 for the whole trial.
""The entirety of my sexual violence trial hinged around me,"" she said.
""There are five weeks of material that debate me, critically engage with my body, my words, my experience and I cannot access them without being wealthy enough to afford court transcripts.
""At the very least, this would support my mental well-being and those who find themselves in this position.""
BBC Newsnight previously found transcription costs at the six government-contracted firms varied from 80p per 72 words, to Â£1.71, for a 12-working-day transcription.
One company said pricing is based on the quantity of material to be transcribed, the level of urgency, and other factors.
Violet added: ""I call for the automatic and free provision of the judges summing up remarks to any survivor of violent crime - the week the trial ends.
""These remarks could answer important and unanswered questions.
""I waited five years for justice and I leave the system mystified as to what happened as I still have no answers.""
The Open Justice Campaign is calling on the government to make amendments to the proposed pilot, to include all court cases and not just ones that end in a guilty verdict.
It was launched by Claire Waxman, the victim's commissioner for London.
""Victims continue to be treated as bystanders in the justice system, and this must urgently change,"" said Ms Waxman.
""Victims need access to accurate and timely transcripts, at no cost to themselves, to support their understanding and recovery.
""This is an essential part of their justice journey, and government must bring forward these vital changes in the Victims and Prisoners Bill.""
In response, the Ministry of Justice said: ""It is vital victims get the support and information they need as they attempt to rebuild their lives and move on which is why we have launched the one year pilot scheme.
""Judges can already decide to provide a full or partial transcription to victims and we continue to look at all other options to reduce the costs of providing transcriptions.""
Julie hopes the government will make changes to the planned trial.
""Not everybody will want to read what happened but an awful lot will like to know how the jury came to their decision and the only way they can do that is by reading the transcript,"" she said.

XJ4MXVNDOI_QD2EJPRLXK8YIOO,"UK-Canada trade rift: What it means for cheese, beef and cars","By Harrison Jones & Tom Espiner in London, Jessica Murphy in Toronto",2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68107263,"The UK and Canada are blaming each other after a dispute over beef and cheese led to the collapse of trade talks.
Negotiations to thrash out a new agreement to replace the one the two countries had when the UK was still in the European Union had been running for nearly two years.
But on Thursday night, it emerged the UK had halted discussions, due to a lack of progress on the two food products.
It could mean tougher trading terms for the UK with a partner that accounted for 1.4% of its total trade in the 12 months to June 2023.
Goods trade between the two countries was worth Â£19.2bn in 2020, according to the UK government, with UK imports from Canada worth Â£7.3bn and UK exports to Canada worth Â£11.8bn.
The implications of the talks collapsing could be felt by consumers and farmers in both countries. Another major sector, cars, will also be affected.
Here's the likely impact on all three areas at a glance.
British farmers will see the collapse in talks as a big win. The body representing UK farmers, the National Farmers Union (NFU), has been putting pressure on the government to protect its members.
Beef farmers in the UK are already facing competition from those in New Zealand and Australia, whose exports benefit from free trade deals with the UK, meaning tariffs are removed.
Minette Batters, the president of the Nation Farmers' Union of England and Wales, said walking away from the Canadian trade deal would have been difficult, ""but it's the right decision"".
Canada's government had been pushing for the UK to relax a ban on hormone-treated beef, which its producers say effectively shuts them out of the British market.
The Canadian Cattle Association said the UK had ""shown no indication that it is prepared to fully accept Canada's food safety system, which is widely recognised as one of the finest in the world"".
It's not the first time that beef has been a sticking point in trade relations between the two nations. Canada's farming industry has previously voiced its frustration to the government, saying that its meat is ""severely disadvantaged"" under a post-Brexit interim agreement with the UK, and essentially blocked out of that market.
Last year, a coalition of Canadian farming groups protested the UK's accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement over concerns about that reciprocal access. They demanded that either the UK accept Canada's food safety system or pay compensation for their losses.
British cheese exports to Canada were worth Â£18.7m - or 2.4% of total cheese exports - in 2022, according to the Food and Drink Federation (FDF).
That translates to Canada importing a little more than two million kilograms of cheese from the UK (its fifth largest supplier), international trade data indicates.
British firm Coombe Castle International is the largest UK cheese exporter to Canada and about a third of the cheese it exports goes to the country.
Ben Hutchins, its sales and marketing director, told the BBC the firm was ""pretty gutted"" that talks had been suspended, adding that the company had been exporting to Canada since 1980.
He said the suspension of talks ""doesn't look rosy"" for cheese exports.
Mr Hutchins said that with a third of the business tied up in Canada after 40 years, it won't be easy to quickly find new markets.
Industry group Dairy UK said the suspension of talks was ""regrettable, but there was little indication that Canada was really willing to improve access to the Canadian cheese market"".
Since the beginning of the year, UK cheese exporters have seen a 245% tariff placed on British cheese going to Canada, impacting prices.
""This has put UK dairy exporters at a disadvantage and disrupted trade,"" a Dairy UK spokesperson said.
""However, exports to Canada are a relatively small part of UK production, and while some UK dairy companies will be faced with a significant commercial challenge, we understand that it will not be insurmountable,"" the group added.
Meanwhile, Canadian cheese exports, including its cheddar, are mainly to other countries. The UK is not in its top ten markets.
The Canadian Cheese Council of Canada, which represents small and medium-sized cheese importers and their suppliers, said its members had spent decades building relationships with the UK cheesemakers.
The December expiry of the time-limited agreement that allowed the UK to continue to sell cheese without high tariffs has already caused ""significant"" disruption in the industry and ""will cripple cheese importers as well as small cheese shops across Canada"", it said.
That, combined with the pause in trade talks, put the efforts spent building those bilateral relationships ""in jeopardy"", Joe Dal Ferro, council chairperson, told the BBC.
""We feel abandoned by both governments"", he said.
Afrim Pristine, who owns the Cheese Boutique in Toronto, told the BBC that cheese from the UK is popular - in December, he sold about 250 kg (550lb) of it every day.
He hasn't yet had to raise prices in his store - he has enough in stock from last year - but when he does, he says ""A - is it going to be available, and B - what's the cost going to be""?
""I don't want to disappoint my customers, clients who've been supporting my business for decades. And that's what's going to happen.""
The UK's biggest goods export to Canada is cars, according to the Department for Business and Trade.
In the 12 months to the end of the second quarter of 2023, exports were worth Â£745.8m.
A time-limited agreement had allowed the UK to continue to sell cars without high import taxes, but this is now in doubt.
Although the UK's exports to Canada are much smaller than those to the EU, Canada is still ""an important market"", according to Mike Hawes of trade group The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).
""Given the close ties between our two countries, the suspension of trade talks is especially disappointing, and sends a signal that the UK's world-class automotive products are not welcome in Canada,"" he said.
If tariffs on UK cars are reintroduced ""this would benefit no one, not least Canadian consumers"", he said, adding: ""We urge all parties to get back around the negotiating table.""
There are no significant imports of Canadian-manufactured cars into the UK, the BBC understands.
There has been a muted reaction from the Canadian automobile industry to the news.

XJG487HTFE_1ZIYU90JEE2WQ8N,London mayor urges action on stricter zombie knife ban,By Noah Vickers,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-68067121,"London's mayor has urged the government to press ahead with a stricter ban on zombie knives and machetes.
Last week, Sadiq Khan criticised ministers for ""unacceptable delays"" over planned changes to the law.
It comes weeks after actor Idris Elba accused politicians of not giving the issue ""the focus it deserves"".
The Home Office has previously said it is ""already an offence to carry a bladed item over three inches in public without good reason"".
The government defines a zombie knife as having ""a cutting edge, a serrated edge and images or words suggesting it is used for violence"".
It has been asked to comment on Mr Khan's latest call to press ahead with a stricter ban.
In August 2023, the Home Office announced plans to create a stronger definition for the weapons and to give police extra powers to seize them, but it is unclear when the new law will come in.
The knives were first added to the government's list of prohibited offensive weapons in 2016, but campaigners argue a ""legal loophole"" still needs to be closed before the knives can effectively be considered banned.
Police have been particularly unable to deal with zombie knives designed to get around the 2016 definition by not having intimidating images or words on them.
Mr Khan said: ""We've repeatedly been promised action, but instead it's harder for a teenager to buy a lottery ticket than a zombie knife, while we've seen a merry-go-round of home secretaries failing to deliver.
""These unacceptable delays must end and I urge the home secretary to urgently bring forward and toughen up this legislation to finally end the scourge of these weapons on our streets.""
The mayor is expected to raise the issue of remaining loopholes in a meeting with Home Secretary James Cleverly later this week.
Liberal Democrat London Assembly member Caroline Pidgeon said: ""The powers over the regulation of zombie knives clearly lie with Westminster, and the UK Government needs to stop dragging its feet and introduce the ban on their sale.
""Every single day the Conservatives delay this legislation is another day people in our streets are less safe as a result.""
Leader of London Assembly Greens Caroline Russell said: ""Of course I'm glad to see the mayor raising the urgency of banning zombie knives, and we really need to stop every kind of knife violence in London.
""If the mayor is serious about preventing knife violence, then he should be equally concerned over the Met's continued sharing of knife images across social media, despite the evidence showing how harmful that is for young people.""
Conservative mayoral candidate Susan Hall has been contacted for a response.

XKFJGCUI7L_EL2KYSUQPLILGUL,Virgin Media most-complained about broadband provider,_,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68093374,"Virgin Media is the most-complained about broadband, landline phone and pay-TV service in the UK.
The company attracted 32 complaints per 100,000 broadband customers between July and September 2023, regulator Ofcom said.
For pay monthly mobile services, O2, which is part of the same group as Virgin, attracted the most gripes.
Virgin Media O2 admitted the figures fell short of its expectations but said customer service was its priority.
Alongside Virgin Media, NOW Broadband and TalkTalk received higher-than-average numbers of complaints for their landline services, while NOW Broadband also received higher-than-average complaints about broadband.
Sky was the best-performing firm when it came to broadband, with only five complaints per 100,000 customers.
Fergal Farragher, Ofcom's consumer protection director, said there had been an overall ""slight increase in complaints"" compared with the previous quarter.
""Providers must continue to focus on improving customer service,"" he said.
Ofcom said a factor in Virgin Media's complaints figures was the regulator's announcement in July 2023 that it was launching an investigation into customers' difficulties cancelling contracts with the firm, and how it handled complaints.
""As well as engaging fully with Ofcom's ongoing investigation, we are investing in every area of our business to give our customers the best possible experience, with a real focus on resolving any issues at the first time of getting in touch and making it easier for them to get support when they need it,"" a Virgin Media O2 spokesperson said.
""Our number one priority is to provide an excellent service to our customers, and we accept that the rise in complaints in the third quarter falls far short of our expectations.
With pay monthly mobile phone services, the data showed six complaints per 100,000 customers for O2, compared with two for the best performing providers, Sky and EE.
Ofcom said that Sky continued to be the provider that attracted the fewest or joint fewest complaints per 100,000 subscribers across all four services.

XKMOV4HWVW_S1FZ96465IOOGKY,Viberoptix: 100 jobs under threat at NI broadband contractor,By John Campbell,3 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-68103938,"At least 100 jobs are under threat at the installation company which works with Fibrus broadband.
Coalisland-based Viberoptix was Fibrus' major contractor on the roll-out of a broadband network in Northern Ireland.
Last week, Fibrus said it was planning up to 60 redundancies as the construction phase of that project is coming to an end.
That is having a knock-on effect to Viberoptix which employs 570 people in NI and England.
The firm has not said how many jobs are under threat, but has started a 90-day consultation, a legal requirement if 100 or more redundancies are planned.
Viberoptix chief executive, Naomhan McCrory, said he was confident the firm could ""pivot"" into other work.
However, ""in the next weeks and months we will consult closely with our staff about the changing shape of our organisation and we will redeploy where possible"".
He added that it would be ""exploring diversification into other sectors and with other partners and clients"".
The Fibrus network development is known as Project Stratum - a government-backed scheme to improve rural broadband across Northern Ireland.
The total funding for Project Stratum was Â£165m, with Â£150m coming from the confidence-and-supply agreement deal signed between the Democratic Unionist Party and the Conservative Party in 2017.
The remaining Â£15m came from Stormont's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs.
That project is due to be completed by March of this year while another Fibrus project in England is at an earlier stage.

XNEMOY8W6S_6YY4OXLV52RVUFG,Three guilty of murdering grandfather in Glasgow flat,_,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-68084198,"Two men and a woman have been convicted of murdering a grandfather in his Glasgow flat.
Brian Maley was stabbed with a knife and a chisel during the attack at his home in Springburn on 8 February 2022.
Maria Gardiner, Michael Anderson and James Houston had denied killing the 52-year-old but were captured on CCTV getting a taxi to the property.
Lord Fairley warned the trio they face life sentences when they are sentenced in March.
Gardiner, 47, Houston, 35, and Anderson, 40, were also found guilty at the High Court in Glasgow of assaulting Lynsey Patterson to her injury at the flat.
In his evidence, Houston told his KC Murray Macara: ""I am sorry to the family. I never knew that someone was going to be assaulted, knifed or murdered.""
He said Anderson had apparently gone to Mr Maley's flat in Young Terrace to ""collect something owed to him"".
Jurors had watched footage of the group initially walking from Govan into the city centre before getting a taxi to Mr Maley's home armed with a toolbox.
Once inside the flat the court heard they launched a brutal attack on Mr Maley and Ms Patterson.
Gardiner and Houston were later arrested at a city centre hotel having spent Valentine's Day together.
Houston said he had ""been played"" and was just an ""innocent bystander"".
He also dismissed a text that he sent about fighting as ""fake bravado"".
Houston said: ""If I knew that was going to happen, I would not have gone at all. Michael just said 'go with me' and I went.""
After the verdict, prosecutor Michael Macintosh said: ""Brian Maley was eagerly awaiting the birth of his first grandson at the time.
""He is survived by three adult daughters - two who have attended the trial each day.
""He is also survived by six grandchildren. The youngest was born just before this trial commenced.""
Lord Fairley adjourned sentencing for reports.

XREB0ICFKZ_NNIQRZVEFLDPGQX,Israel reined in by ICJ rulings on Gaza - but will it obey?,By Paul Adams,2 days ago,20230126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68113223,"This was not a complete victory for South Africa, or the Palestinians.
The ICJ did not order Israel to halt its military campaign - an implied recognition of Israel's right to self defence in the wake of the Hamas attacks on 7 October last year.
But the UN's highest legal body has recognised that the situation in Gaza is catastrophic.
Crucially, it said that situation was ""at serious risk of deteriorating further"" before the court delivers its final verdict on the charge of genocide, a process that could take years.
As a result, it made several demands of Israel, broadly in line with most of the nine ""provisional measures"" demanded by South Africa.
By large majorities the court's 17 judges ruled that Israel should do everything in its power to avoid killing Palestinians, causing them serious bodily or mental harm, creating intolerable living conditions in Gaza, or deliberately preventing Palestinian births.
It also said Israel should do more to ""prevent and punish"" public incitement to genocide, citing examples by Israel's president and defence minister.
And there was a call for ""immediate and effective measures"" to address the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.
Not a call for a ceasefire, then, but a series of demands that, if implemented, would drastically change the nature of Israel's military campaign in Gaza.
Israel vehemently rejects the allegation of genocide, arguing that it is Hamas that's responsible for putting Palestinian civilians in harm's way.
It says Hamas operates inside and underneath Gaza's densely populated towns and refugee camps, making it virtually impossible for Israel to avoid killing civilians.
And it says that it has gone to great lengths to warn civilians to avoid danger.

Watch: ICJ orders Israel to prevent genocidal acts
The belief that Israel has ""the most moral army in the world"" is one almost universally held by the country's Jewish citizens.
But since early October, Israel's actions have resulted in the displacement of around 85% of Gaza's 2.3 million population.
Those who flee the fighting seeking refuge in squalid, overcrowded shelters, with dwindling healthcare and grossly inadequate humanitarian supplies.
It was clear, soon after the court's American president Joan Donoghue began speaking, that the urgency of Gaza's plight was uppermost in the court's mind and that Israel had not succeeded in its bid to have the entire case thrown out.
Judge Donoghue delivered a bleak summary of the suffering being experienced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. She said the plight of children was ""especially heartbreaking"".
This is not the court's final ruling on genocide - that's likely to take several years.
But the measures called for today are designed to offer the Palestinians of Gaza some measure of protection, while the judges consider South Africa's fundamental charge against Israel.
Israel must now decide how to respond. The ICJ's rulings are binding, but there's no enforcement mechanism. Israel could choose to ignore the judges altogether.
With diplomatic efforts now apparently concentrating on the possibility of a two-month ceasefire, and efforts still being made to improve the flow of aid into the Gaza Strip, Israel may argue that it's already taking steps to meet the court's demands.
But even if the situation eases - and there's no sign yet - the fact remains that Israel still stands accused of genocide, a case the ICJ believes is plausible and thus worthy of further detailed consideration.
Israel, a country born out of the ashes of the world's worst example of genocide, must now live under this legal shadow until the court delivers its verdict.

XRMX6SME6P_IA9B1306LPZIP44,"Russell Scott Primary School: Pupils paddling in sewage, head teacher says",_,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-68054896,"The head teacher of a school in need of urgent repairs after being flooded with sewage and rain water said the mounting problems were a constant ""nightmare"".
Steve Marsland said he was forced to empty out buckets of water from leaks around Russell Scott Primary School in Denton whenever it rains.
It comes after a BBC Panorama's investigation into the damage and decay of some schools across the country.
The Department for Education (DfE) said pupil and staff safety was ""paramount"".
""You've got children paddling in sewage, rain pouring through the windows,"" said Mr Marsland.
""We've got floods and having to put sandbags against the doors when it rains heavily.
""Here we are in 2024, the government has now promised us a new school will be built but that was two years ago.""
The school in Greater Manchester, which has more than 460 pupils, underwent a multi-million pound refurbishment in 2015 to its 150-year-old building.
But Carillion, the company contracted to carry out the repairs, left the school with a catalogue of new problems, including faulty fire doors.
Carillion has since gone bankrupt, with debts of more than Â£7bn, and the school has been left battling issues old and new, including flooding, roofs leaking and heating failures for nearly a decade.
Mr Marsland said the school now needed to be knocked down and rebuilt, costing millions of pounds to the tax payer.
He added those involved with the building work needed to ""hang their heads in shame"".

""We've had children paddling in sewage two or three times,"" he said.
""When it first happened, we had little girls, thinking they were doing the right thing, trying to mop it up with paper towels.
""So you can imagine we've had health issues, all number of problems with children being [exposed] to sewage around where they're sat, where they're learning, it's scandalous.""
He said this was not just an issue for Russell Scott Primary School but schools across the country had been facing similar issues.
""The Panorama is an expose about the state of British schools and the lack of repairs and the lack of money,"" he said.
""Our children are the most precious resource we have.
""They're our future and they need to be looked after, not put in buildings that are unsafe.""
He added ridiculous amounts of money had been wasted already.
""The way in which these contracts are procured that's where an investigation needs to start,"" he said.
""These big companies are robbing the tax payer blind and have taken so much money out of the public purse.
""That's why our schools are in the state they are, because money is being spent in the wrong places.""
But despite being plagued by issues, Mr Marsland said the school community had rallied together.
""Good teachers can teach in a barn and our teaching staff have had to come to the fore,"" he said.
""They're so good and our school community has supported the school. They know where the blame lies,"" he said.
""We're always full, we're a very popular school and we have got really high standards and that's a tribute to the school community as a whole.""
When Panorama contacted the DfE, it said the school would have ""a detailed programme plan to review"" by the end of January 2024 and would be more ""deeply engaged"" by the department from that point onwards.

In a statement, a DfE spokesperson also said the government had compiled the largest and most comprehensive survey of school building conditions in Europe - the first of its kind - to ""significantly"" improve the condition of the school estate, targeted where it was needed most.
The spokesperson added Â£15bn of capital funding had been allocated since 2015 for essential maintenance and improvements, including Â£470m in 2023 ""to address school buildings in need of immediate support as quickly as possible"".
In addition, the School Rebuilding Programme, which began in 2021, commits the government to rebuilding 500 schools in England, both primary and secondary, over the next 10 years.

Mia Janin, 14, a pupil at the Jewish Free School (JFS) in Kenton, north-west London, was found dead at her family home in Harrow in March 2021.
Teacher Alistair Davey told Barnet Coroner's Court he did not remember her standing out as being isolated.
Mia's father, Mariano Janin, believes she was targeted by other pupils.
Mr Davey told the inquest that Mia was a ""quiet, thoughtful and considerate"" girl and he was unaware of any group chats relating to her.
The inquest also heard that Mia's mother, Marisa Janin, had contacted the school to say her daughter was feeling lonely and isolated.
In one communication with staff, Ms Janin - who has since died - said Mia was upset at being one of the few children to ""never have been invited to the bar mitzvahs of the girls in her class"".
Rabbi Howard Cohen, former deputy head teacher at JFS, told the inquest that after Mia's death there was ""some talk around the school"" of what he described as ""boys-only bravado groups"" sharing images of girls.
Rabbi Cohen, who was the pastoral lead at the school and responsible for safeguarding, was also made aware of a boys' WhatsApp group where members rated the ""attractiveness"" of female pupils.
But there was no reason to believe the groups related to Mia, Rabbi Cohen said.
The former deputy head teacher told the inquest he held a meeting with members of one of the group chats who then agreed to disband it.
He then held a Year 10 boys-only assembly advising pupils to remove themselves from any such groups, the inquest was told.
Police discovered two hand-written notes when Mia was found, one addressed to her parents, and another to her best friend, the inquest heard.

Tributes have been paid to the chief officer of West Midlands Fire Service, Wayne Brown, who was found dead on Wednesday.
Mr Brown was appointed to the role in January 2023, having joined West Midlands Fire Service in 2019.
His death was not being treated as suspicious, police said.
The fire service confirmed on Tuesday that Mr Brown had been under investigation by the employer.
That inquiry, the BBC understands, relates to a business qualification which is a requirement of the role.
On Thursday, flags were flying at half mast at the service's headquarters in Birmingham. Staff had been offered support, it said.
The day before, West Midlands Police said the body of a man in his 50s had been found at a property in the city.
A force spokesperson said: ""The man's family is being supported by specialist officers and our thoughts are with them at this time.""
Chief Constable Craig Guildford said: ""Wayne Brown was a really good friend to West Midlands Police. He will be sorely missed.""

Greg Brackenridge, chair of West Midlands Fire and Rescue Authority, said: ""All our thoughts and love are with [Mr Brown's] family, his friends and his colleagues.""
He also shared a request from the family for ""time and space at this tragic time"".
A number of fire services from across the country have paid tribute on social media.
Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service posted on X: ""Our sympathies go out to Wayne's loved ones, friends and colleagues at this extremely tragic time.""
The police, fire and crime commissioner for Staffordshire, Ben Adams, wrote on the same platform: ""Many in fire and rescue saw Wayne as a role model. He broke new ground and championed everything at his best in the service.""
The Labour MP for Birmingham Erdington, Paulette Hamilton, added on X: ""He was an inspirational leader and will be missed.""
Mr Brown spent 27 years in London Fire Brigade rising to the role of assistant commissioner.
Andy Roe, from the brigade, said: ""Wayne was a valued and respected colleague.""

Y81M22EXGF_OEFKJH1E9U0XOQE,'I was told I was too glamorous to do a good Burns speech',By Megan Bonar,3 days ago,20230124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-68020589,"For years, the clubs set up to preserve and celebrate the rich literary legacy of Robert Burns have been traditionally male environments.
They followed the lead of the Bachelors' Club, a men-only debating society set up by Burns and his brother in Tarbolton, Ayrshire in 1780.
It was only in 2015 - more than 200 years later - that Prof Kirsteen McCue became the first woman to deliver the toast to the immortal memory at the Bachelors' Club Burns supper.
But in 2024 some Scottish Burns clubs still have no female members.
Women like Prof McCue, Isabel Lind, and Kerry Burley - leading figures on the Burns circuit - say female inclusion has improved, but there is still a long way to go to change entrenched attitudes.
Prof McCue, the former co-director of the Centre for Robert Burns Studies at the University of Glasgow, said her invitation to speak at the Bachelors' Club was not universally popular.
""That was a big deal, it was a really big thing to be asked,"" she said.
""The night certainly warmed up, there was definitely a tension in the air but it ended up being one of the best Burns experiences I've ever had.
""I found out afterwards that some of the committee had not been overly supportive of having a woman speak, but I did not get that sense on the night.
""I can understand the hesitance, they were breaking their tradition but I would say it was the right thing to do.""
Meanwhile Kerry Burley, who has been a regular at Burns suppers for more than a decade, is about to become president of Sandyford Burns Club in Glasgow.
""I've been doing immortal memories at Burns events since my late 20s and everywhere you go you get a lot of looks up and down, folded arms and scoffing. I do enjoy shutting them up,"" she said.
""I gave a toast just the other day and a man came up to me after and said he thought I was too glamorous to give a good speech, but he had been proven wrong.
""One of the speeches known as the toast to the lasses is often full of dirty jokes, some of the jokes told when I was first on the scene would be considered hate speech nowadays. But there is more gentleness now.""
Ms Lind, the vice-president of Greenock Burns Club, one of Scotland's longest-running clubs, says she has noticed a change in attitudes over the years.
It has welcomed women since 1980 and she is due to become its president for a second time.
""The first time I was president of the club in 1996, I was not invited to meetings with other clubs, which meant that our club wasn't represented at these meetings,"" she told BBC Scotland News.
""They wouldn't have us because we had a woman president. Things have gotten a lot better since then but there's still a way to go.""
There are 131 affiliated Burns clubs in Scotland, according to the Robert Burns World Federation, as well as many more around the world.
They celebrate Burns Night and organise events throughout the year such as poetry readings, themed dinners, and educational initiatives.
New Cumnock Burns Club and Glasgow Haggis Club are among those which remain male-only, or ""stag clubs"", but official figures on the total number are not held.
Jon Wilson, the new president of the New Cumnock club, said they had never had a female member - but there was nothing in the constitution banning women from joining.
""Every member be it male or female, would have to be approved by the committee before becoming a member,"" he said.
""We look at your standing in the club, and obviously some personal bias may come into that. Somebody must propose you and it needs to be agreed by everybody, or at least a majority.""
Mr Wilson said the strict membership process was to ""protect club numbers"" and to ensure the club had a ""good, clean"" supper.
""At every event, apart from our supper, we have female guests. It's just been that traditionally our supper has been a male-only event, and that's been for the last 100 years,"" he said.
A spokesperson for Glasgow Haggis Club confirmed their club remains male-only.
Other clubs might invite women to give speeches, such as the immortal memory or the reply from the lassies at their events, but they stop short of allowing them to become members.
Change is happening though.
Last Friday, for the first time ever, 10 of the 83 attendees at the Montrose Burns Club's supper were female and members have recently approved a new club constitution making the club ""inclusive to all"".
And last year, Bridgeton and Dumbarton Burns clubs also voted to welcome female members for the first time.
Under her presidency of Sandyford Burns Club, Ms Burley wants to encourage more women to join and to have an all-female top table at next year's Burns supper.
""Being a millennial, I was kind of outraged that women who had been involved in the clubs for decades are still being denied memberships,"" she said.
""I understand the need for men's spaces, but the difficulty is so many Burns clubs are dying and you are missing out on 50% of your membership.
""This isn't tirade against stag clubs, but I would say to them: 'Give it up boys'.
""I understand the traditions of your club however the world has changed, the world will continue to change.""
Prof McCue said it was important that Burns clubs move with the times.
""I think what's unfortunate is in the 21st Century this [male-only clubs] is becoming a social abnormality. Everything we work on now, we are trying to achieve diversity,"" she said.
""So what was a social norm when many of these clubs were created, isn't a social norm now. I think it's a big problem for organisations like Burns clubs that are made up of older members.""
In Greenock, Ms Lind said a lot of her club's community work is led by women and the Bard himself would not have approved of any ban on women.
""I think he would want women to be members, he admired women a lot and had a great gift with females.
""He wrote about the rights of women away back then, he spoke about his great admiration and the decorum of women.
""It's amazing he was writing about that in those days.""

YAE31X1IHL_N0LR6MJEV4OK9CZ,Speedboat killer Jack Shepherd freed from jail,_,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-68083296,"Speedboat killer Jack Shepherd has been released from prison after he was jailed for six years over the death of 24-year-old Charlotte Brown on a date.
Ms Brown died in 2015 after she was thrown from the boat when it capsized on the River Thames after hitting a submerged tree trunk.
Shepherd, 36, was freed, with conditions, after serving half of his sentence behind bars.
He was also serving a concurrent term of four years for an unrelated assault.
Shepherd and Ms Brown were on a first date after meeting on an online dating site.
The pair had been drinking champagne and the boat was in poor condition, the original trial heard.
Shepherd was plucked from the Thames alive, but Ms Brown was found unconscious and unresponsive and died later in hospital.
Shepherd, originally from Exeter, then went on the run, and was convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence in his absence after an Old Bailey trial in 2018.
When a person in England and Wales is given a sentence of imprisonment for a period of time, the law allows for prisoners to be released on licence to serve the last part of their sentence in the community.
Depending on the type of sentence, they can be:
A person released on licence will be supervised by probation staff and must comply with certain conditions. If they breach the conditions of their licence they can be returned to prison to serve part, or all, of the remainder of their sentence in prison.
Source: House of Commons Library
The following year Shepherd handed himself in to police in Tbilisi, Georgia, and was brought back to the UK, where he was also handed a four-year-jail term for attacking a barman, to run at the same time as his six-year sentence.
He was convicted of wounding with intent for hitting former soldier David Beech with a vodka bottle after being asked to leave The White Hart Hotel in Newton Abbot, Devon, in March 2018.
In July 2020, appeal judges ruled that the 78 days he spent in custody in Georgia should count as time served, meaning an earlier release date than would originally have been expected.

YGM6S01NPA_G6TTRJWN7IKI0WC,Hertfordshire Police detective sent 'avalanche' of abusive messages to woman,By Kris Holland & Will Durrant,4 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-68084382,"A police detective sent an ""avalanche of abusive messages"" to a woman, a misconduct hearing was told.
Hertfordshire Police ex-Det Insp Phillip Moss, who had had a 28-year career, resigned on 13 December and has been told he cannot serve again.
A report showed messages from the ex-detective to a woman named as Miss A, his former partner.
The hearing was told that ""nearly all"" of the 365 pages of messages were ""challenging"".
Det Insp Moss also called the woman offensive names in front of her daughter, the report said.
Chief Constable Charlie Hall, who wrote the report, said Mr Moss had ""cause to be angry"" after Miss A was unfaithful to him, said the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
But he added: ""I have no doubt that anyone receiving such persistent and continuous abuse from someone they loved would have found this harmful to them.""
He sent the messages between 30 July and 11 October 2019.
The report reads:""Former DI Moss has clearly sent a very large volume of messages, a great many of which contain abusive, offensive, and insulting words.
""These are in the great majority directed towards Miss A and are clearly intended to be hurtful and distressing to her.
The chief constable noted Miss A had appeared ""more and more vulnerable"" as time went on, ""a factÂ Mr Moss must have recognised - but his behaviour does not abate"".
Miss A sent Mr Moss ""profuse apologies, explanation and attempts to placate and repair [the] relationship, but he was having none of it as the continued abusive messages showed"".
Mr Moss who had ""an otherwise unblemished record"" admitted his behaviour amounted toÂ a breach of the Standards of Professional Behaviour for discreditable conduct, and a breach of authority, respect and courtesy.
His name will be added to theÂ College of Policing barred list.

YJ1K3RJNK6_RTWZJA85Z66Z5WY,Ex-Fujitsu boss admits calling Horizon 'Fort Knox',_,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68068949,"A former head of Fujitsu UK has admitted that he told former Post Office boss, Paula Vennells, that the Horizon IT system was like ""Fort Knox"".
However, Duncan Tait told the BBC his comment was not related to who had remote access to Post Office branch accounts.
Ms Vennells informed MPs in 2020 that she was told branch accounts could only be changed by sub-postmasters.
However, it has since emerged the accounts could be accessed remotely.
A public inquiry into the Post Office scandal is currently ongoing.
In a statement to the BBC, Mr Tait said: ""As the public inquiry is already aware, I did refer to Fort Knox in a conversation with Paula Vennells - this was in relation to the cyber and physical security of Horizon and was unrelated to the remote access issue.""
More than 900 sub-postmasters and postmistresses were prosecuted after the faulty Horizon software wrongly made it look like money was missing from their branches.
Some sub-postmasters and postmistresses were jailed, others were bankrupted and some have since died following what has been described as the biggest miscarriage of justice in UK history.
Last week, Nick Read, chief executive of the Post Office, was criticised for not knowing when the company first knew that remote access to sub-postmasters' Horizon systems was possible.
When prosecutions were taking place, Fujitsu had told the Post Office that no-one, apart from sub-postmasters themselves, could access or alter Horizon records - meaning the blame for mistakes could only rest with sub-postmasters. But that turned out to be untrue.
Speaking to MPs on the Business Committee four years ago, Ms Vennells said: ""I remember being told by Fujitsu's then chief executive when I raised it with him that the system was 'like Fort Knox'"" - a reference to the US military base which holds a large proportion of the US's gold reserves.
""He had been a trusted outsource partner and had the reputation of a highly competent technology sector chief executive,"" she said. ""His word was important to me.""
The scandal has been pushed back into the spotlight following the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office.
In his statement, Mr Tait said: ""As I have said before, I am appalled by the harsh treatment of the sub-postmasters and postmistresses.
""I fully support the inquiry and it would be inappropriate for me to comment further ahead of giving my evidence.
""This has been a terrible miscarriage of justice and like others at Fujitsu, I am sorry for the damage that has been done to the sub-postmasters and postmistresses' lives and any role that Fujitsu played in that.""
Last week, the boss of Fujitsu's European arm, Paul Paterson, told the public inquiry into the scandal that the company had ""clearly let society down, and the sub-postmasters down"".
Mr Patterson admitted there had been ""bugs, errors and defects"" with the Horizon software ""right from the very start"".
Why were hundreds of Post Office workers prosecuted?"

A popular music festival in Dumfries has been cancelled for 2024 due to escalating costs.
Organisers of the Doonhame Festival said a combination of financial issues and personal commitments meant the event could not continue.
Previous headliners for the two-day event have included the Fun Lovin' Criminals, Gun and the Waterboys.
The event was held on the grounds of the Crichton estate.
In a statement co-director Sandy Sweetman said the decision had followed ""much deliberation"".
He added: ""Balancing ticket price with the rising costs of putting a festival together and looking at our own limited availability to dedicate the necessary time to the project sadly makes it unsustainable.""
Mr Sweetman told BBC Scotland News that he would ""never say never"" about a possible return for the event in future years.
The Doonhame Festival was first held in 2019, but then cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
It then returned in 2022 and was held for a third time in 2023.
Music fans in the region had previously enjoyed the Wickerman festival, which ended after the 2015 edition."
YMFMS0F6TR_16JZUQ1K3CT2SKI,Captain Cook statue vandalised in Melbourne on eve of Australia Day,By Hannah Ritchie,4 days ago,20240125,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-68090094,"A century-old Captain James Cook statue has been cut down and a Queen Victoria monument covered in red paint in an apparent protest in Australia.
The late-night vandalism occurred in Melbourne on the eve of Australia Day and is under police investigation.
The holiday on 26 January is the anniversary of the 1788 landing of Britain's First Fleet at Sydney Cove and the start of the colonial era.
The vandals wrote ""The colony will fall"" on the Cook statue's plinth.
Police said the ""criminal damage"" to both memorials happened in the early hours of Thursday.
""It is understood the [Cook] statue was sawn off at the ankles. Several people were seen loitering in the area around the time of the incident,"" Victoria Police said in a statement.
The 1914 monument commemorates Cook's 1768-1771 voyage during which he charted the country's east coast and paved the way for a later decision to send the First Fleet led by Captain Arthur Phillip.
The statue has a history of being vandalised on or around 26 January. In 2022 it was splashed in red paint, while in 2018 it was graffitied with the words ""no pride"" and had an Aboriginal flag placed next to it.
Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan said the vandalism of both monuments had ""no place in our community"".
""We'll be working with council to repair and reinstate the statue in St Kilda,"" she added, referring to the suburb where it is located.
Work is also under way to clean the Queen Victoria memorial in the city's centre.
Port Phillip Mayor Heather Cunsolo said that while she understood the ""diverse views surrounding Australia Day"" she could not condone ""the vandalism of a public asset where costs will be ultimately borne by ratepayers"".
She said her council had arranged for a security guard to protect the Cook statue on Thursday, but the incident occurred before they were scheduled to arrive.
Opinion polls show roughly 60% of Australians support celebrating Australia Day on 26 January.
But many Indigenous Australians and others say it is wrong to celebrate a date which represents the theft of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander lands and their dislocation from culture.
""Invasion Day"" protests have grown in recent years and many people boycott the holiday.

Diogo Moreira, 24, was parked outside a block of flats in Kelbrook Close, in Beaumont Leys, when the explosion took place at 16:07 GMT on Wednesday.
He kicked through the front door to allow the man, who appeared to have suffered burn injuries, to escape.
The man remains in hospital where he is being treated for his injuries.
Mr Moreira, from Leicester, said he felt a pressure in his chest and a loud bang when the explosion happened.
""When I looked up, all the windows had been blown away and there was glass everywhere,"" he said.
""I got out the van straight away and went to the front window and I heard the guy screaming.
""I started shouting at him to see if he could respond to me and I kept shouting to him to go to the front door.
""And then my instinct just really told me you have to go in and try and help.""
Mr Moreira covered his face and ran to the front door that had already been blown away, but had to kick in another door to get into the flat.
He helped the man outside and sat him down until the emergency services arrived.
Another eyewitness said she saw Mr Moreira enter the property, despite people telling him not to.
The Portuguese national said his friends told him he was ""either courageous or stupid"".
""I just tried to emphasise like, if you do good things and try to help other people when they are in need, it's just much easier and much better,"" he said.
Police said a man, 32, who was arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life, has been de-arrested.

The book, by John Whittle, was taken out on 30 June 1979 and had not been seen since.
But staff at Manningtree Library, in Essex, were left ""so excited"" when it was returned by the customer's family last week.
Michele Price, who supervises the library, said it was in ""fantastic condition"" and a late fee was waived.
Ten different UK prime ministers have led the UK since the book was borrowed, while Rishi Sunak was not born.
""It's not very common we get them returned after such a long period of time which is why I think my team at Manningtree Library were so excited to see it,"" she told BBC Essex.
""I haven't read the book myself but for those I have chatted to and knew that era, they recognised the book and its contents.""
Ms Price said the book was brought in by relatives of the person who borrowed it in summer 1979.

Aviemore and Glenmore Community Trust (AGCT) said owning the site would give it a bigger say in issues affecting the Glenmore area, such as housing, parking and transport.

YWBE10XH5P_C52ROI6PMRX42MS,Nottingham: 'Hero' student Grace O'Malley-Kumar died protecting friend from killer,By Dan Martin & PA Media,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-68033875,"A student was killed while ""heroically"" trying to protect her friend when he was stabbed as they walked home from a night out in Nottingham.
Grace O'Malley-Kumar, 19, showed ""incredible bravery"" trying to defend Barnaby Webber from Valdo Calocane when he attacked them, a court heard.
His pleas of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility were accepted at court on Tuesday.
Ms O'Malley-Kumar fought with Calocane before he turned on her.
Her family said they were proud of her.

Watch: 'I've been completely lost without her' - Grace's brother
Addressing Calocane in court, Dr Sanjoy Kumar praised his daughter as a hero who shunned the opportunity to run away.
He said: ""She bravely intervened. She would never leave a friend in adversity. It was not in her nature.
""She heroically and valiantly fought you. Like a hero she put herself in harm's way.
""But unfortunately because of the weapon you carried she stood no chance.
""You showed yourself to be a cold, cowardly and calculating killer. You casually walked away, leaving my child lying in the street.""
The court heard the University of Nottingham students Mr Webber, 19, and Ms O'Malley-Kumar, were walking home to their student accommodation after an end-of-term night-out when they were fatally stabbed in Ilkeston Road just after 04:00 BST on 13 June.
Prosecutor Karim Khalil KC said Mr Webber had been stabbed ""repeatedly"" with a dagger, inflicting ""grave injuries"" and causing him to fall to the floor.
Ms O'Malley-Kumar showed ""incredible bravery"" and tried to protect her friend, fighting and pushing Calocane, 32, into the road, but the killer then turned his attention to her and was ""as uncompromisingly brutal in his assault"", he added.
Family members in the public gallery sobbed as Mr Khalil told the court Ms O'Malley-Kumar's injuries were too severe and she collapsed as Mr Webber tried to defend himself from the ground, kicking out at his attacker, before Calocane ""calmly"" walked away.
Ms O'Malley Kumar's brother James said: ""She was the best to me. Since everything happened, I've been lost without her.
""I've not just lost my older sister, but my best friend - someone I'd go to about everything. I was so proud, I would always speak about her.
""It's a joy to be able to say she's my older sister, it's a privilege. Now my job is to do my best to make her proud.""
The court was told Calocane made his way from the scene of the double killing to a residential hostel in Mapperley Road, where he arrived at about 05:00.
At 05:04, he tried to gain access to the premises through ground-floor windows, but ""retreated"" after being confronted by an occupant who punched him in the face.
School caretaker Ian Coates, who was driving his Vauxhall van in nearby Magdala Road, was repeatedly stabbed, suffering wounds to his abdomen and chest, at about 05:14.
Mr Khalil told the court: ""The defendant then took Ian Coates' van, leaving him for dead.""
Mr Coates, 65, was discovered by members of the public shortly after 05:30, found to be unresponsive and was pronounced dead shortly after paramedics and police arrived.
Prosecutors accepted a plea of manslaughter from Calocane on the basis of diminished responsibility after he denied murder charges in November.
Calocane was suffering ""serious"" mental illness, the hearing was told.
Mr Khalil said the families of the victims had been consulted before the prosecution decided to accept the pleas entered.
However, Dr Kumar, said his daughter would be disappointed with the way the case had concluded.
Calocane, who answered to the name Adam Mendes in court, also admitted attempting to murder three pedestrians he hit with a van.
He had stolen the vehicle from Mr Coates, who he stabbed after attacking the two students.
The court also heard, after taking Mr Coates's van, Calocane drove it to Milton Street, where he hit Wayne Birkett, who was crossing the road. He suffered a fractured skull which caused a bleed to his brain and was said to be extremely fortunate to survive.
The defendant then drove in a loop and was seen by a marked police car at about 05:29.
Officers activated their lights but Calocane accelerated away and then knocked down Sharon Miller and Marcin Gawronski, who were walking to work across a pedestrian central reservation.
Ms Miller and Mr Gawronski were also both extremely fortunate to survive, the court heard.
Calocane was arrested after being Tasered about five minutes after the final victims were injured. He produced a knife when the van was stopped and boxed in by police vehicles.
Mr Khalil said that three psychiatrists had assessed Calocane, concluding that despite suffering paranoid schizophrenia, he would have understood the nature of his conduct in attacking three of his victims with a dagger described in court as ""a double-edged fighting knife"".
The prosecutor said the victims' families had been consulted and it was decided that it would be appropriate to accept the pleas to manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility.
He added: ""For the avoidance of any possible doubt, it is the Crown's position that the appalling facts of this case render it to be one of the utmost seriousness.""
Calocane's barrister Peter Joyce KC told a previous hearing the defendant ""does not dispute the physical facts of the prosecution's case"" but was suffering from ""extreme"" mental illness at the time of the incident.
He now faces a sentencing hearing expected to last for about two days.

The Scottish government abandoned the legal challenge against a Westminster veto of its legislation last month.
Scottish Secretary Alister Jack has suggested he would aim to reclaim about Â£150,000 in expenses.
However, it would be for the court to decide on a figure if it rules the funds should be reimbursed.
Mr Jack said Scottish ministers had pursued the case ""in spite of the cost to the taxpayer"".
Last week it was confirmed legal advisers had started the process of seeking an award of expenses for defending the case.
The Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill, which would make it easier for people to change their legally-recognised sex, was passed last year following a heated debate in the Scottish Parliament.
The UK government then used a Section 35 Order of the Scotland Act to prevent it from becoming law over concerns it would have an impact on equality laws across Britain.
A Scottish government legal challenge against the block was rejected by the Court of Session in December.
Holyrood ministers opted not to appeal the ruling, saying they had been put in an ""impossible"" position.
Social Justice Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville told MSPs the bill had not been abandoned but was awaiting an incoming UK government that ""has more respect for devolution"".
Mr Jack told MPs in January that UK government costs arising from the case had risen to Â£150,000.
He said:  ""I am pleased they have taken the sensible decision not to oppose our motion for expenses.
""That could have further increased the cost to the taxpayer.""

Watch: Trump lashes out at 'imposter' Haley in victory speech
Donald Trump has won the New Hampshire primary, defeating his last remaining rival for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley.
His victory means the race for the nomination is all but over, even if Ms Haley is not yet ready to end her campaign - a fact that clearly irked the former president on what was otherwise an evening of celebration.
""She's doing... a speech like she won,"" he said of his rival, who pledged to stay in the race earlier in the evening. ""She didn't win. She lost.""
A rematch in November's general election with President Joe Biden, the likely Democratic candidate, now looks more certain.
Although Mr Trump's victory in New Hampshire did not match the 20-point margin that was predicted by recent polls, it should be more than enough to maintain the current direction of the race.
He won by a landslide in the first contest in Iowa. And the upcoming states on the Republican primary calendar tilt more heavily in his favour than New Hampshire, suggesting his march towards the nomination will soon become a stampede.
With each passing vote, a truth becomes increasingly clear. As polls for many months have shown, the Republican Party is still Donald Trump's party.
His base's loyalty is unwavering, through dramas both legal and political. His brand of conservative populism is in step with his party's voters, as is his focus on issues like immigration, crime and energy.
That may not deter Ms Haley in the short term, but the reality is that New Hampshire was her best shot to disrupt Mr Trump's steady march toward the Republican presidential nomination.
She spent tens of millions of dollars here and had the endorsement of the state's popular Republican governor, but New Hampshire's independent voters and large proportion of college graduates were not enough to deliver victory.
Ms Haley is now looking ahead to the primary in her home state of South Carolina next month. To get there, however, she will need the campaign contributions to keep flowing.
Even with a better-than-expected finish that is no guarantee, given that her long odds of winning the nomination just got even longer, with huge Trump polling leads in many of the remaining states.
If she does stay afloat, she may not get a particularly warm homecoming. Mr Trump has the endorsement of most of South Carolina's Republican establishment, and he has a commanding lead in the polls. It was a point the former president was quick to point out in his Tuesday night speech.
""We'll head out to South Carolina where I think we're gonna win easily,"" he said in front of a cheering crowd in the city of Nashua.

Watch: Haley congratulates Trump, but says race is not over
A drubbing in her old stomping ground would be an ignominious way to end what has been a relatively successful campaign for Ms Haley. It is a fate she may ultimately choose to avoid, but she has a month to try to turn that around.
Even if Ms Haley does ultimately throw in the towel in the days ahead, the New Hampshire results should cause some concern among Mr Trump's team.
A Fox News voter analysis found 32% of those who participated in the Republican primary would not vote for him in November's general election if he wins the nomination. Only 49% said they would consider themselves a Maga supporter - a reference to the former president's Make America Great Again campaign slogan.
A CBS exit survey also paints a picture of Mr Trump's support base, but it also shows its limitations. Among self-identified ""very conservative voters"", the former president won 88%. He carried 66% of primary voters with no college degree and evangelical Christian voters by a similar margin.
He won only 23% of moderates and 39% of college graduates - groups he will have to appeal to if he wants to beat President Biden.
And after Tuesday night's results, that 2020 presidential rematch seems much more likely, even if that is a prospect polls suggest many Americans do not welcome.

Z2YT2W4A0U_G9UF462OG3OVTL4,Ecuador police arrest gang members who stormed hospital,By Vanessa BuschschlÃ¼ter,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-68055945,"Ecuadorean security forces have arrested 68 gang members after they stormed a hospital in the town of Yaguachi, in Guayas province.
Officials said the men tried to take over the facility, at which a member of their gang was receiving treatment.
Police said the intruders' aim was to guard the patient from potential attacks from rivals.
There have been previous incidents in which gang members have been targeted while in hospital.
In 2022, seven gunmen were arrested when they stormed a hospital in the town of Chone in search of a rival gang member who was in intensive care.
During that incident, nurses and hospital staff were taken hostage as the men exchanged fire with police.
It is not yet clear which gang was behind Sunday's storming of the Yaguachi hospital, nor who the injured man was they were trying to guard.
Police said he had arrived at the hospital in the early hours of Sunday with gunshot wounds. He has since died of those wounds, they said.
After securing the hospital, the security forces also raided a nearby ""rehabilitation centre"".
Drug rehabilitation centres are often used as a front by gangs. Officials said this one was used as command centre for their illegal operations, as well as a brothel.
The raid comes amid a state of emergency declared by President Daniel Noboa in response to a surge in gang violence.
More than 2,700 suspects have been arrested since Mr Noboa declared war on the gangs on 9 January, saying that there was an ""armed internal conflict"" between the criminal groups and security forces.
The president took the unprecedented step as gunmen took journalists and staff at a TV station hostage during a live broadcast.

Since then, soldiers have been deployed to help police quell the violence, which had spread from the country's prisons to the streets of Ecuador's major cities.
According to the government, 201 prison guards and staff, who had been held hostage by rioting inmates, have been freed.
But the gangs also appear to have stepped up their attacks.
In one of the most shocking incidents, a prosecutor who was investigating the attack on the TV station, CÃ©sar SuÃ¡rez, was shot dead on his way to a hearing in the port city of Guayaquil on Wednesday.

Z41TS990N0_HAXU86ST71X2DD6,Airport scanner delay will prolong 100ml liquid ban,By Katy Austin,7 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68031052,"The UK's biggest airports are set to miss the deadline for installing new advanced security scanners that will end the 100ml limit on liquids.
The government told major airports to have the high-tech equipment in place by 1 June 2024.
But Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester do not expect to have all their scanners ready by then.
Consumer group Which? warned it could cause confusion during the summer holidays.
The group said passengers may expect the hand luggage security rules to have been changed at all UK airports, only to find that is not the case, which could cause delays at security.
When the Department for Transport (DfT) announced the deadline, it said the scanners would both improve security and mean more convenience for people travelling, ending the need for ""tiny toiletries"".
The rules requiring liquid items to be taken through security in containers of 100ml or less and put in a clear plastic bag were introduced in 2006 after a plot to bomb a transatlantic flight was foiled.
Airports were originally told to bring in new scanners by 2022, before the deadline was moved to June this year.
They use CT X-ray technology to provide 3D images. That means two litres of liquid can be taken through, inside bags. Laptops can also be left in bags.
They are already used in some other countries including the US.
Trials in the UK began in 2018, and airports have been gradually putting them in place. Some, including Teesside and London City Airport, have already finished their rollouts.
However, London Gatwick, Heathrow and Manchester are all expected to need extra time to finish installing the new equipment across all their lanes.
That means some lanes will still use the current scanners for this year's summer holidays, so people will still need to stick to the 100ml liquid limits.
Aviation commentator Sally Gethin outlined some of the reasons for the delay.
""[The scanners] are very heavy. Sometimes the floors in the actual terminal have to be reinforced. The cost is really high for these particular scanners - it's the latest technology,"" she said, also pointing to supply chain issues and airports having to free up staff for training.
Heathrow has already begun introducing the new equipment in three of its four terminals, but cannot guarantee the rollout will be complete by June.
A source pointed out that Heathrow has 146 security lanes, more than any other UK airport, and the installation process had to be carefully managed to avoid hindering the flow of passengers.
The airport is understood to be working with the government on how passengers can be provided with ""clear messaging"".
Gatwick said it will have made ""significant progress"" in both terminals by June but does not expect to finish installation until early next year ""after the busy summer peak period has concluded"".
Construction work is under way at Manchester and East Midlands airports to expand terminals to accommodate the new equipment.
A spokesperson for Manchester Airports Group said that while ""good progress"" was being made, completion of the programme is not expected until 2025.
The BBC understands the DfT may consider allowing airports extensions to complete installations across their whole premises where it deems it ""appropriate"".
However, if they miss the deadline without permission, penalties are not being ruled out.
Rory Boland, travel editor at Which?, said: ""We're now going to go into a situation where different [UK] airports have different rules, so at some places you will need to get the liquids out in advance, at others you won't.""
He said this could cause confusion and hold-ups at security. ""You only need a couple of passengers to not be prepared to end up having to wait an extra 10, 20, 30 minutes.
""It is disappointing that we're in a situation just months ahead of the peak travel period... and major airports aren't ready.""
Mr Boland said airports' communication with passengers would be very important.
Travel association Abta advised people planning holidays this summer to double check the rules at each end of their journey.
""It's important to remember that even if your departure airport in the UK has changed its rules around liquids when you travel later this year, you'll also need to check the rules that are in place for the airport you'll be returning from as they may be different,"" Abta said.
A DfT spokesperson said: ""The UK has some of the most robust aviation security measures in the world and this cutting-edge technology will enhance security and boost the passenger experience.
""We are in regular contact with airports as they move towards [the] June 2024 deadline for upgrading their screening equipment and processes. For security reasons we don't talk in detail about aviation security measures.""

Z8SOGKLW9O_NH0A6KFX489OVQQ,Defiant Trump takes legal risk on stand in New York defamation trial,By Brandon Livesay and Nada Tawfik,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68071744,"Donald Trump testified on Thursday in the defamation trial brought by writer E Jean Carroll, but his much-anticipated time on the stand was kept brief.
The former president - who has already been found to have defamed Ms Carroll for comments he made about her in 2019 - was under strict rules on what he could say.
But he told the jury that he stood ""100%"" by a deposition given in 2022 in which he strongly denied her sexual assault allegations and called her a ""whack job"".
Other comments he made were struck from the record by the judge for breaching the restrictions, which took significant time to agree before he took the stand.
Mr Trump has been testing the limits of the courts in his various legal cases that have become intertwined with his re-election campaign.
It's a strategy which keeps his political base invested and tuned in, and gives him considerable press coverage as he looks set to become the Republican presidential nominee.
A related civil trial last year found that he had sexually assaulted Ms Carroll, a magazine columnist, in a New York department store in the 1990s and pay her about $5m in damages. The jury also found him liable for defamation for calling her accusations a lie.
Despite that ruling, he continues to regularly deny the attack in public comments.
This civil trial focuses on separate defamatory comments Mr Trump made about Ms Carroll in 2019 while in the White House, with the jury considering how much Trump must pay in damages.
Closing arguments will take place on Friday and a ruling could swiftly follow.
Mr Trump's continuing denials of Ms Carroll's sexual assault allegations - despite what a court already found - are the reason why he was under severe limits on what he could say in his testimony in the New York court on Thursday.
The legal complications meant the judge and lawyers spent much more time arguing about what Mr Trump would be allowed to talk about compared to his four minutes of testimony.
Judge Kaplan said the first trial established the facts and the only issue remaining was how much Mr Trump must pay Ms Carroll, if anything. The Republican frontrunner was told he would not be allowed to deny that he sexually assaulted Ms Carroll.
The strict terms made it impossible for Mr Trump to launch into a monologue or to campaign from the witness stand.
It's perhaps a lesson learned from one of Mr Trump's other legal battles. In a New York civil fraud trial earlier this month, Mr Trump was initially told he could not give his closing argument. The judge in that case asked whether Mr Trump would keep it short and stick to the matters of the case.
Mr Trump responded with a six-minute monologue in which he argued he was a victim of political persecution.
The defamation trial on Thursday gave the 77-year-old much less leeway.
Asked if he stood by his deposition, Mr Trump said: ""100% yes.""
His lawyer Alina Habba then asked if he denied Ms Carroll's accusation. ""That's exactly right, yes I did,"" he responded.
He went on to say ""she said something that I considered a false accusation - totally false"".
But Judge Kaplan quickly cut Mr Trump off and told the jury to ignore that last statement.
Finally, Ms Habba asked if her client had ever instructed anyone to hurt Ms Carroll, to which Mr Trump said: ""No, I just wanted to defend myself, my family and frankly, the presidency."" The judge again ordered the latter part stricken from the record.
And with that, the testimony was over. As he left the courtroom Mr Trump was heard saying: ""It's not America. This is not America.""
Earlier in the day, Judge Kaplan warned him to stop interrupting proceedings by ""talking loudly"". That included a moment when he was heard muttering under his breath that he had ""never met this woman [Ms Carroll]"".
Testifying outside of the limitations outlined by the judge on Thursday could have theoretically caused Mr Trump to face hefty fines or even five years in prison for perjury.
Ronnell Andersen Jones, a professor of law at the University of Utah, told BBC News the case showed the ""wide gap"" between Mr Trump's strategies in court and on the campaign trail.
While the former president and his lawyers may want to convince the jury that his comments in the White House did not show ""ill will that warrants punitive damages"", that is easier said than done considering his actions.
""This will be a hard row to hoe, given that this same jury is daily receiving new evidence that the defendant, outside the courtroom, continues to spread the lie undeterred,"" Ms Jones said.
The defamation trial will resume on Friday at 09:30 ET (14:30 GMT) with closing arguments. It is not yet known if Mr Trump will attend.

ZB6TEVS6HC_WUVBLTH1KAF86H5,Holiday school meals: Parents in Wales take fight to court,By David Deans,5 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-68000699,"The end of free school meal support in school holidays in Wales pushed a family into ""sheer poverty"", a parent has said.
He and another parent have been given the go-ahead to go to court to try to get the decision reversed.
Mark, not his real name, said the Welsh government's failure to hold a consultation before it cut the support was not fair on those who received it.
The Welsh government, which is fighting the case, said it could not comment.
Ministers have said the policy, which could be worth as much as Â£20 a week per child, was unaffordable and always time-limited.
A legal charity working on the case said parents told them they either had very little or no notice that the support was ending, after councils were told last June.
The charity - the Public Law Project (PLP) - say no indication was given that the scheme was ending before local authorities were told.
Both parents want the provision reinstated for the next school holiday.
Granted anonymity as part of the legal action Mark said the additional payment had been a ""godsend"" for his family.
The severely-ill father, who has a large family and has been out of work for a number of years, said the support had been worth more than Â£100 a week to his family during holiday weeks.
""It would allow us to go to Tesco and do a really good shop - buy fresh things, vegetables, instead of pre-packed things.""
He said he found out that the scheme would end days before the holidays were due to begin, initially through a friend.
The withdrawal of the money made a difficult situation worse. He said he and his partner ""rarely eat"" and do not consume as much as they used to.
When the vouchers ended his family was put into ""sheer poverty"", he said.
""The only way out, because we were caught in that trap when it stopped in the summer, was to take out a loan.
""The reality is what we're receiving doesn't quite cover what is going out.
""Keeping up with the payments is physically impossible. We can't afford to buy food and pay bills and pay for the utilities.""
The father said it was ""not fair how they acted. There was no consultation, no one was aware"".
A second parent in the case, who has children eligible for free school meals, told her legal representatives that over time she began to rely on the vouchers as an ""essential part of our income"".
She said she had no information or notification that the vouchers would stop, and found their withdraw extremely challenging.
School meal support during the holidays began during the pandemic, and had been repeatedly extended - with the most recent extension to the end of the May half term holiday of last year.
PLP argued the lack of an impact assessment on ethnic minorities and single parent; the lack of evidence that officials considered the impact of the decision on children and the lack of a consultation, was unlawful.
The charity said the announcement on 9 March of the May extension gave no indication that ending provision was on the mind of the government.
The legal charity said an email from a Welsh government official, dated 23 June 2023, said ""work is continuing as a matter of urgency to determine the future of the holiday [free School Meals] scheme"".
Days later, on 28 June, the Welsh government wrote to councils saying there would be no further extension.
Lawyers said the Welsh government failed to show ""due regard to the best interest of children"" as required by a 2011 Welsh law that enshrined the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child on the statute books - the first UK country to do that.
They also criticised the lack of assessment of the impact on people with disability, those from an ethnic minority background, or on single parents.
But the Welsh government argues the case is academic because of a fresh decision taken in October 2023 not to reinstate the support.
In an impact assessment drawn up to justify the decision, which BBC Wales has been told is connected to the legal action, said not reinstating the scheme ""may increase food insecurity and could have a negative impact upon mental and physical health"", but claimed the negative impacts ""will be mitigated"".
The Welsh government said: ""We were always clear that it was a time-limited crisis intervention. The support ran from early in the pandemic until May 2023. In England it ceased in April 2021.
""As this is active litigation, it would not be appropriate to comment further on this matter at this stage"".
The spokesman added every child in every primary school would be entitled to free school meals by September 2024.
The application for judicial review is expected to be heard in the High Court sitting in Cardiff in March.

ZKD2YY4XK3_4IZ4OYQFN6EBC8A,World's first IVF rhino pregnancy 'could save species',By Rebecca Morelle and Alison Francis,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-68064432,"A fertility breakthrough has offered hope for saving the northern white rhino from extinction - there are only two of the animals left on the planet.
Scientists have achieved the world's first IVF rhino pregnancy, successfully transferring a lab-created rhino embryo into a surrogate mother.
The procedure was carried out with southern white rhinos, a closely related sub-species of northern whites.
The next step is to repeat this with northern white embryos.
""To achieve the first successful embryo transfer in a rhino is a huge step,"" said Susanne Holtze, a scientist at Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Germany, which is part of the Biorescue project, an international consortium trying to save this species.
""But now I think with this achievement, we are very confident that we will be able to create northern white rhinos in the same manner and that we will be able to save the species.""
Northern white rhinos were once found across central Africa, but illegal poaching, fuelled by the demand for rhino horn, wiped out the wild population.
Now only two rhinos remain: two females, Najin and her daughter Fatu. Both of the former zoo animals are kept under tight security at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya.
Unable to reproduce, the species is technically extinct. But now the Biorescue team has turned to radical fertility science to bring these animals back from the brink.
They started their work using southern white rhinos. This close cousin of the northern whites has a population of thousands - and is considered a conservation success story although it's still threatened by illegal hunting.
The project has taken years and has had to overcome many challenges: from working out how to collect eggs from the two-tonne animals, to creating the first-ever rhino embryos in a lab and trying to establish how - and when - to implant them.
It took 13 attempts to achieve the first viable IVF pregnancy using southern white rhinos.
""It's very challenging in such a big animal, in terms of placing an embryo inside the reproductive tract, which is almost 2m inside the animal,"" Susanne Holtze told BBC News.
The embryo, which was made using an egg from a female southern white from a zoo in Belgium and fertilized with sperm from a male in Austria, was transferred into a southern white surrogate female in Kenya, who became pregnant.
However, the success was followed by tragedy.
Seventy days into the pregnancy, the surrogate mother died after becoming infected with Clostridia - a bacteria found in the soil that can be deadly to animals.
The death dealt a blow to the team - a post-mortem revealed that the 6.5cm male foetus was developing well and had a 95% chance of being born alive.
But it showed that the technique had worked and that a viable pregnancy through rhino IVF was possible. Now the next step is to try this using northern white rhino embryos.
There are only 30 of these precious embryos in existence, stored in liquid nitrogen in Germany and Italy.
They were created using eggs harvested from Fatu, the younger female in Kenya, and sperm collected from two male northern white rhinos before they died.
However, the birth of a northern white calf will require another scientific first.
Neither of the last two surviving northern whites can carry a pregnancy because of a combination of age and health problems. So instead the embryo will be implanted into the womb of a surrogate southern white rhino.
IVF across a sub species has never been tried before, but the team is confident it will work.
Prof Thomas Hildebrandt, the director of Liebniz IZW and project head for the Biorescue Consortium, said: ""I think the situation for the northern white rhino is quite privileged for the embryo transfer because we have a closely related recipient - so their internal map is nearly the same.""
The Biorescue team hopes to implant the embryos in the coming months. They want the calf to be born while some northern white rhinos are still alive.
""We want to preserve the social communication, the social heritage of the northern white rhino by putting the first calf on the ground so they can learn the language from the last two rhinos, they can learn how to behave from them,"" explained Prof Hildebrandt.
The researchers are aware that adding some more animals through IVF will not save this species - there wouldn't be enough genetic diversity to create a viable population.
So they are simultaneously working on an even more experimental technique, attempting to create rhino sperm and eggs from stem cells, to go on to produce embryos.
Again, this will take time and there will be many scientific challenges to overcome.
Some wildlife experts also argue that pouring more money and resources into a species that's as good as lost could be better used in saving more viable species.
However, Jan Stejskal, the BioRescue project coordinator from Safari Park Dvur Kralove in the Czech Republic where Najin and Fatu were originally from, said: ""One thing that we have to understand is that behind the extinction of the northern white rhino is man. It's not because of some evolutionary pressure, it was greed, it was the consumption of a rhino horn.
""So, in a way, we are responsible and if we actually have a technique that can assist us to save them, then I think we have a responsibility to use it and to try to save them.""
Samuel Mutisya, head of research and species conservation at Ol Pejeta, added that the northern whites were a critical party of the ecosystem and the team was ""committed to do all that is humanly possible to nurture, protect and recover the species"".

Michael Conwell, 30, of Lettershandoney Avenue, Lettershandoney, Londonderry, appeared in handcuffs at Ballymena Magistrates' Court on Thursday.
He denies membership of the New IRA and having a gun in Dungiven on 19 January.
On that evening, a masked and armed gang reportedly entered St Canice's GAA club and several pubs and issued threats.
He is also charged with having a metal pole at Garvagh Road in the town on the same date.
A detective constable, who opposed bail, told District Judge Nigel Broderick that he could connect the accused to the charges.
He said that on the night in question, three masked men had entered five licensed premises in Dungiven and issued threats about drug dealing.
Police believed the defendant had been ""leading the charge"" during the incidents.
CCTV footage seized by detectives linked him to a car used by the masked gang.
The detective added that the gang had met at Owenbeg GAA centre beforehand to plan their ""terrorist activity"".
He said that the examination of mobile phones linked Mr Conwell to co-accused Dermot Burke, 58, of Drum Road, Dungiven, who appeared in court on terrorism charges earlier this week.
The district judge refused a bail application and remanded Mr Conwell in custody until 19 February.
About 100 children and their parents were in St Canice's clubhouse for an underage presentation when a masked gang allegedly entered and made threats.

A wind speed of 91mph (146km/h) was recorded at Gwennap Head, near Land's End in Cornwall, with up to 70mph (112km/h) around the region.
National Grid said 37 homes in Cornwall and 54 homes in Devon were without power.
A yellow warning for wind was in place until midday.
Tree surgeon Paul Wright, whose firm Teign Trees dealt with at least 22 incidents in the South Hams and Newton Abbot areas, said conditions were ""absolutely appalling"".
""One of the hardest things last night was the rain which was horizontal at times, like a monsoon,"" he told BBC Radio Devon.
Teign Trees was among at least seven tree surgeon firms clearing roads around Devon.
""We've had 15 gangs out and we're not a massive company so it's all hands on deck,"" said Mr Wright who worked through the night and was taking more calls as the morning rush-hour started.
Great Western Railways said a damaged bridge meant rail travel between Exeter St David's and Barnstaple was not possible.
Network Rail said it was investigating and could not yet say whether the damage was storm-related.
""We will reopen the line as soon as it's safe to do so,"" said a spokesperson.
""Currently it's expected that it will remain closed for the rest of the day.""
Some of the highest wind speeds recorded were 86mph (138km/h) on St Mary's on the Isles of Scilly, 69mph (111km/h) at Chivenor in north Devon, 66mph (106km/h) at Plymouth and 61mph (98km/h) at Camborne, said BBC South West meteorologist Bee Tucker.
At airports in south-west England, Bristol and Newquay have had services cancelled or delayed by the weather.
Andrew Giles and his family were among those affected by flight cancellations at Cornwall Airport Newquay.
Their Ryanair flight to Portugal had been due to leave at 16:05 GMT on Sunday but they were put on a bus to Stansted in Essex where they got a flight at 08:45 GMT.
Mr Giles, from Looe, Cornwall, said it had been ""absolute chaos"" at Stansted with many others affected by flights disruption.
""We were given meal vouchers but they weren't accepted by any shop here. They were only for Newquay,"" he said.
""We felt very neglected by everyone at the airport.
""There were families with very small children and older people with wheelchair needs who were just overlooked as well.""
Ryanair said it was ""working hard to re-accommodate affected passengers"" and advised passengers to check the Ryanair app for the latest updates on their flight.
A spokesperson said: ""Ryanair sincerely apologises to all passengers affected by these storm-related disruptions which are entirely beyond our control and have impacted all airlines operating to/from the UK and Ireland.""
BBC South West presenter Ollie Yates said he had a ""flight from hell"" returning from Krakow in Poland on Sunday.
He said it was ""scary"" descending to Bristol Airport at about 18:30 GMT.
""There was a lot of anxiety, there was panic, people were crying,"" he said.
After a couple of attempts to land, with the plane ""pulling up very fast"", the flight was diverted to Stansted where the plane got down on the second attempt at about 20:30 GMT.
He managed to hire a car, arriving at Bristol Airport at about 05:00 GMT and getting home at about 08:00 GMT.
""I'm going to have a good sleep now,"" he said.
""There will be a few people on that flight who will be thinking twice about flying again but credit to the captain and the crew.
""They did an amazing job.""

Jill Morrison, 41, of Wolff Close, Belfast, had previously denied a charge of assisting offenders in relation to the killing.
A defence lawyer told Belfast Crown Court he had an application to have the defendant re-arraigned.
When the charge was amended to ""assisting an offender"" and put to Ms Morrison she replied ""guilty"".
The charge related to dates between 26 and 29 January in 2019.
Prosecuting counsel said the guilty plea was acceptable to the prosecution and asked that two further counts of perverting the course of justice and withholding information from police ""be left on the books and not to be proceeded with without the leave of this court or the Court of Appeal''.
An agreed basis of plea document signed by both the prosecution and defence was handed into the judge.
The judge ordered the Probation Service to prepare a report on Ms Morrison for her sentencing hearing on a date yet to be fixed.
With no objections from the prosecution, the judge released Ms Morrison on continuing bail to await sentencing.
A non-jury Diplock-style trial of a number of men on charges arising from the murder of Ian Ogle is due to start next week at Belfast Crown Court.
The 45-year-old was beaten and stabbed to death near Cluan Place in east Belfast."
ZTGVK7QOKY_O4FRNIZU1IY163K,Man jailed for Edinburgh knife murder after attack on ex-girlfriend,_,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-68057244,"A man has been jailed for 18 years for murdering a hotel porter in a row over his ex-partner.
A court heard Sam Atkins, 29, was angry after being dumped by Raehanna Cameron. He attacked her and her friend Charles Paul who had tried to protect her.
Mr Paul, 69, died after being stabbed at least 22 times at a flat in Granton Crescent, Edinburgh, in March 2023.
At the High Court in Glasgow, Atkins pleaded guilty to murder as well as two charges of assaulting Ms Cameron.
Lord Clark described the murder as ""an act of appalling brutality"".
The court heard that Atkins and Ms Cameron, 36, had got together in January 2022, but she ended up feeling ""unsafe"" around him.
She wanted to end the relationship but Atkins ""did not take it well"".
He assaulted her shortly before the fatal attack on Mr Paul.
Mr Paul, a night porter at Edinburgh's Bruntsfield Hotel, knew Ms Cameron through her late father.
He had promised to look after Ms Cameron after her father's death.
On the day of the murder she had left Atkins' possessions outside her flat.
Ms Cameron was at the property with Mr Paul.
She went to charge her phone, but realised Atkins' was already plugged in.
Ms Cameron found him in the hallway holding two knives. In a bid to escape she locked herself in a bedroom.
The court was told that Mr Paul could be heard ""trying to reason"" with Atkins urging him to ""calm down"".
Ms Cameron called 999 and begged for help.
Police arrived as Atkins jumped out of the second floor window. He was later traced by a police dog nearby.
Officers found Mr Paul unresponsive and in a pool of blood in a bedroom. He had suffered at least 22 stab wounds and other injuries.
Ronnie Renucci KC, defending, said Atkins had been ""under the influence"" at the time and had no memory of the killing.
He added: ""He has had difficulty accepting what he had done. He does not recognise the person who committed these offences.""
Lord Clark jailed Atkins for at least 18 years, and said the parole board would decide ""whether and when"" he would be released.
Police Scotland said it welcomed the sentencing and hoped that it brought closure for Mr Paul's family.
Det Ch Insp George Calder said: ""These were despicable and callous acts carried out by Atkins, who showed an utter disregard for the life of Charles Paul or for the woman he seriously assaulted.""

ZVT7Q4GFCI_9F9YKB15S80QJFP,BBC presenter's 'flight from hell' after Storm Isha diversion,By Leigh Boobyer & Emma Hallett,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-68058103,"A BBC presenter has described his ""flight from hell"" after Storm Isha forced a pilot to divert to another airport.
BBC South West presenter Ollie Yates was travelling to Bristol Airport from Krakow, Poland, on Sunday during strong winds with Buzz Airlines.
Mr Yates said the pilot made multiple attempts to land at Bristol Airport, before diverting to Stansted Airport.
An airline spokesperson advised people to check the Ryanair app for updates.
Mr Yates said ""the drama started"" as they began the descent.
""I got on board the flight, lovely beautiful blue skies in Poland and then as we were taking off, the captain announcement came that there was a 50/50 chance we would be landing in Bristol,"" he told BBC Radio Devon.
""There was a lot of anxiety, there was panic, people were crying.
""It was scary. And after a couple of attempts, a lot of movement of the plane, pulling up very fast, it set off a lot of panic.""
Bristol Airport said it experienced gusts of up to 69mph on Sunday evening.
After attempting to land in Bristol at about 18:30 GMT, Mr Yates said the captain announced they would be diverted to Stansted Airport instead.
The plane landed at the London international airport on the second attempt at about 20:30 GMT.
Buzz Airlines operates within the Ryanair Group.
A spokesperson for Ryanair said it is working to re-accommodate affected passengers and advised all passengers due to travel to/from the UK or Ireland on Monday to check their Ryanair app for the latest updates on their flight.
There were 17 flights cancelled at Bristol Airport on Sunday, while seven were diverted.
There were two cancellations on Monday - both KLM flights to Amsterdam.
""People just wanted to land safely. Which we did in the end and the captain did an amazing job, but it was nerve-racking,"" said Mr Yates.
Even when on the ground, passengers were still unable to leave the plane for another two hours because the winds were too high to attach the stairs and get everyone off the plane safely, he added.
Mr Yates eventually managed to hire a car, arriving at Bristol Airport at about 05:00 GMT and getting back to his home in Devon at about 07:00 GMT.
""There will be a few people [from that flight] who will be thinking 'I don't want to fly anytime soon',"" Mr Yates said.
Bristol Airport said Sunday's disruption may have ""knock-on effects"" for those travelling on Monday, and has urged customers to check with their airline for the latest information.
The Met Office said the highest recorded wind speed during Storm Isha was 99mph at Brizlee Wood in Northumberland with gusts of 90mph at Capel Curig in Snowdonia on Sunday.
The Met Office's warnings related to Storm Isha have lifted but a new storm, called Jocelyn, is expected to hit parts of the UK and Ireland from Tuesday, with more warnings for rain and strong winds.
