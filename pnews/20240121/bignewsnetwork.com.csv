Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley has questioned rival candidate Donald Trump's mental fitness after he appeared to confuse her with former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a campaign speech on Friday.
Like many in his party, Trump has blamed Pelosi for the riot at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, arguing she deliberately left the building under-protected despite his offer to deploy the National Guard for enhanced security.
The presidential frontrunner ""mentioned me multiple times in that scenario,"" Haley told supporters at a campaign event in Keene, New Hampshire, on Saturday. ""They're saying he got confused, that he was talking about something else, he's talking about Nancy Pelosi.""
""The concern I have is - I'm not saying anything derogatory - but when you're dealing with the pressures of the presidency, we can't have someone else that we question whether they're mentally fit to do this,"" she explained.
Trump ""made a pretty apparent gaffe last night,"" Haley's campaign manager, Betsy Ankney, agreed during a Bloomberg News event on Saturday, referring to the former president's apparent confusion of one of his chief Democratic nemeses with the woman he appointed to serve as ambassador to the United Nations.
Speaking at Friday's rally, Trump accused his political enemies of having ""destroyed all of the information"" from January 6 ""because of lots of things like Nikki Haley is in charge of security."" He insisted that ""we offered her 10,000 people, soldiers, National Guard, whatever they want. They turned it down.""
Trump has previously claimed he warned Pelosi about the huge crowds poised to descend on Washington DC to protest the certification of then-president-elect Joe Biden's victory. The ""Stop the Steal"" protest turned violent after police clashed with demonstrators, leaving four people dead.
At 77, Trump is just a few years younger than his chief rival, incumbent leader Biden. He insisted on Saturday that he had ""aced"" a recent cognitive test, while his senior campaign adviser, Chris LaCivita, downplayed the Haley/Pelosi mix-up, calling it a ""distinction without a difference - it's Nikki and Nancy"" in comments to reporters.
Trump handily won the Iowa caucuses earlier this month and continues to dominate the party's nominating contest with a double-digit lead in most polls. Haley, however, has seen her poll numbers surge with support from Republican power brokers who don't want to see Trump return to the White House, elevating her to second place ahead of New Hampshire's Tuesday primary vote.
The former South Carolina governor has called for ""mental competency tests"" for aging politicians in a dig at both Trump and Biden. The latter's own abundance of incoherent ""gaffes"" have senior Democrats concerned about his chances of winning - and surviving - a second term.

Russia blames Ukraine for the attack in Tekstilshchik. Ukraine has not commented on the event and the Russian claims could not be independently verified by The Associated Press.
Russia-appointed head Denis Pushilin said that the area had been hit by 155 mm caliber and 152 mm caliber artillery, and that the shells had been fired from the direction of Kurakhove and Krasnohorivka to the west. He also confirmed that emergency services continued to work at the scene.
Reuters news agency photographs and video taken at the scene showed crying people, some of whom said they had lost their relatives, and bodies lying on blood-soaked snow in the area.
In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry called the attack 'a barbaric act of terrorism' committed by Ukraine, adding it was carried out 'with the use of weapons supplied by the West.'
Russia also condemned the attack as ""a treacherous act against the civilian population,"" saying, ""These terrorist attacks by the Kyiv regime clearly demonstrate its lack of political will towards achieving peace and the settlement of this conflict by diplomatic means.""
During its almost two-year invasion of Ukraine, Russian airstrikes and heavy shelling on the sovereign nation have killed thousands of Ukrainian civilians.
Donetsk is one of four regions in Ukraine's east and south that Russia claimed to have annexed in late 2022 in a move condemned as illegal by most countries in the U.N. General Assembly. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions.
Drone attack - massive fire
Outside St. Petersburg, Russia, a fire broke out at a chemical transport terminal at the Ust-Luga port after two explosions there, which according to local media, were caused by Ukrainian drone attacks, causing a gas tank to explode.

Russia's second-largest natural gas producer, Novatek, 165 kilometers (102.53 miles) southwest of St. Petersburg, said, in a statement to Russian media outlet RBC, that the fire was the result of an ""external influence"" and that the blaze had paused operations at the port.
Yuri Zapalatsky, the head of Russia's Kingisepp district where the port is based, said in a statement that there were no casualties, but that the area had been placed on high alert.
News outlet Fontanka reported that two drones had been detected flying toward St. Petersburg Sunday morning, but that they were redirected toward the Kingisepp district. The Associated Press could not independently verify the reports.
The Russian Ministry of Defense did not report any drone activity in the Kingisepp area in its daily briefing. The ministry said that four Ukrainian drones had been downed in Russia's Smolensk region, and that two more had been shot down in the Oryol and Tula regions.
Russian officials previously confirmed that a Ukrainian drone had been downed on the outskirts of St. Petersburg on Thursday.
Ground war stalemate
Russian forces also seized the village of Krokhmalne in Ukraine's Kharkiv region, Russia's Ministry of Defense said Sunday.
Ukrainian forces confirmed the report but called the capture of the village a ""temporary phenomenon.""
The fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces along the roughly 1,500-kilometer front line has remained static throughout the winter.
Zelenskyy-Trump
Separately, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed concern over the prospect of Donald Trump returning to the White House and said he considers the former U.S. president's claims that he could stop Ukraine's war with Russia in 24 hours ""very dangerous.""
FILE - Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets with international media in Riga, Latvia, Jan. 11, 2024.
In an interview with the U.K.'s Channel 4 News that aired Friday, Zelenskyy invited the former president and front runner for the Republican presidential nomination to visit Kyiv, provided Trump delivers on his promise in a way that can satisfy Ukraine.
""Donald Trump, I invite you to Ukraine, to Kyiv. If you can stop the war during 24 hours, I think it will be enough to come,"" Zelenskyy said.
The Ukrainian leader voiced concern over a potential Trump presidency, in which Trump's idea of a negotiated peace in Ukraine might involve Ukraine making major concessions to Russia.
Trump has repeatedly stated that he is well-positioned to negotiate an end to the war that has raged for almost two years, saying he has a good relationship with both Russian and Ukrainian leaders.
Throughout his political career, he has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, including after Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
Zaporizhzhia power plant - mines
International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi warned Saturday that mines had been replanted around the Russia-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, just months after a team of international inspectors reported the area had been cleared of mines.
IAEA Denied Access to Parts of Russia-Controlled Ukraine Power Plant
In a statement on the agency's website, Grossi cautioned that mines in the plant's buffer zone, between its internal and external fences, go against the agency's safety standards.
The head of Ukraine's state nuclear company, Petro Kotin of Energoatom, called the alleged re-planting of mines ""another crime"" by Russian forces who have occupied the Zaporizhzhia plant since the early weeks of the war.
The IAEA has repeatedly expressed concern the war could cause a potential radiation leak from the facility, which is one of world's 10 biggest nuclear power stations.

Linor Abargil, and Qanta Ahmed were participating in a group discussion at the gathering. The Israeli-organized event, titled, ""Women at the Forefront of the Global Peace and Security Agenda.""Abargil, now a lawyer, women's rights activist and mother of four, described being raped as a teenager several weeks before the 1998 Miss World competition, which she went on to win, becoming connected to women's rights groups around the world, and the silence she encountered from those organizations following Hamas's sexual violence during the October 7 massacres in southern Israel. Abargil's voice trembled as she read from her prepared remarks.
""On October 7th we witnessed the most horrible massacres atrocities rape mutilation of the worst human behavior carried out by the Hamas terrorist organization. I turned to all my colleagues and friends worldwide, as well as to the leading women's rights organization to expose this terrible event, certain that they will speak up and condemn this unspeakable event,"" Abargil said.
""And what did I discover? That there is a discriminatory approach, and violence against one woman doesn't equal to violence another, as in this case of Israel. Their silence, apathy and oblivion shocked me to the core. They even had the audacity to ask for evidence when it was all there to see. There is no need for more proof, it's all out there to see,"" she said.
""And there's still girls that are out there being raped and abused every day. Anyone who doesn't speak up against this is silently complicit to sexual violence against all women, not just Israeli women. For the first time, I really feel alone. I always felt that as a victim, I had support, that someone had my back. And now I stand here at Davos with that empty feeling of being alone,"" Abargil said.
""The word is silent is not and not a word is being said. I cannot accept that I have come here alone carrying their blood, their torn clothes, their wounds, their broken bones, their shattered and burnt bodies left behind by Hamas with nothing left to bury,"" she added.
Also participating was Dr. Qanta Ahmed, a Muslim doctor from Britain and women's rights activist. Ahmed visited Israel after the October 7 attacks ""to bear witness,"" she said.
""I felt compelled to go and witness the events shortly after October 7 in my capacity as a doctor and as a Muslim who condemns the actions of Islamist jihadism, which is how I believe Hamas acted,"" Ahmed explained. ""And the work of a doctor is generally listening to a patient and keeping them company, even if we have no treatment options, and that bearing witness is important for us to do as human beings, whether we're Muslim or Jewish or Christian.""Ahmed stressed that ""These ideologies in radical Islam are all about exterminating 'the Other,' including the Christian women in Qaraqosh, in Nineveh in Iraq, burning churches, eliminating women, girls [and] babies. They do not discriminate in their hate, though the antisemitism I've seen is eliminationist and genocidal.""Ahmed added that she was visiting Israel's National Forensic Center ""looking at the remains of people that had been subjected to this genocidal violence, when a Muslim Queen questioned if there was truly evidence that children and women had been lost in this way,"" referring to Jordanian Queen Rania. The queen had told CNN that the butchery ""hasn't been independently verified.""Said Ahmed to Abargil, ""So many Israeli police, detectives, soldiers doctors, forensics specialists told me even more barbaric than the violence was the denial and so your voice is extremely important and I stand with you, not because I'm a Muslim committed to demolishing radical Islam, but as a human being and you are my fellow human being and I will stand with you.""The true scope of the rapes may never be known, because most of the victims and witnesses were killed. At least 1,200 people were massacred in Hamas's attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on Oct. 7. Several female hostages released during a November ceasefire have described being sexually abused while in captivity.
The Davos discussion also featured Tatiana Kotlyarenko, an advisor on anti-trafficking issues at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and Anastasiya Dzyakava, an expert on child protection. (ANI/TPS)"

The US is preparing for a ""sustained"" bombing campaign in Yemen after ten days of airstrikes failed to undermine the ability of Houthi fighters to target ships in the Red Sea, the Washington Post has reported, citing unnamed officials.
The administration of President Joe Biden does not expect a protracted operation such as the US campaigns in Iraq or Afghanistan, but at the same time it cannot provide a timeframe for when Houthi military capabilities will be adequately diminished, the newspaper reported on Saturday.
Washington's strategy is to curb the ability of the Shiite militant group to target ships off the coast of Yemen, or at least create safe conditions for shipping companies to resume sending vessels through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, sources added.
The Houthis have launched dozens of drone and missile attacks on commercial ships in the area in recent months, declaring support for Gaza amid Israel's military operation in the Palestinian enclave.
The militants have also vowed revenge against the US and the UK, who have been carrying out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen for more than a week.
""We are clear-eyed about who the Houthis are, and their worldview. So we're not sure that they're going to stop immediately, but we are certainly trying to degrade and destroy their capabilities,"" one US official told the Post.
Washington is ""not trying to defeat the Houthis. There's no appetite for invading Yemen,"" a diplomat familiar with the situation explained. Instead, the US wants ""to degrade their ability to launch these kind of attacks going forward, and that involves hitting the infrastructure that enables these kind of attacks, and targeting their higher-level capabilities,"" he added.
President Biden ordered the strikes on Yemen for ideological reasons, rather than economic, as the US seeks to maintain its status as the world's ""indispensable nation,"" officials claimed.
The Washington Post expressed concern that the bombing campaign against the Houthis would become a ""setback"" for Biden's goal of preventing the spread of the Israel-Hamas conflict to other parts of the Middle East. It could also end up ""undermining his attempt to refocus US foreign policy on Russia and China,"" the newspaper argued.

Several asylum seekers, primarily from Syria and Afghanistan, have left the central German state of Thuringia after local authorities imposed tough controls on how refugees can spend their benefits, Bild reported on Saturday.
Under rules introduced in December last year, asylum claimants are issued with pre-paid payment cards instead of cash handouts, as a means of preventing them from abusing the system and taking money out of the state.
The card is only credited if the claimant appears in person at a local office, and remains in their assigned district. Shopping is allowed wherever Mastercard is accepted, but the card only works in the region specified by a personalized map, making it impossible for refugees to make transfers to their home countries.
District administrator Martina Schweinsburg has confirmed that 200 cards have been handed out since the change took effect last month, with all 740 refugees in the Greiz district of Thuringia set to receive one by the end of the month.
The head of refugee affairs, Dagmar Pohland, told Bild that the restriction is not unreasonable as the law requires asylum seekers to stay in the district they were assigned to for the first three months.
""Most people accept the change and are happy that they are getting something at all. But back in December, 15 refugees said 'We don't want a card, we want cash' and left shortly afterwards,"" the head of refugee care added.
""Anyone who is really on the run doesn't care about the method of payment. You buy clothes or food. But some people also get overpriced cell phones, especially younger people and solo travelers,"" he explained, adding that ""the state has allowed too much abuse so far.""
The newspaper noted that the total number of refugees leaving the country has significantly increased since then.
Mario Voigt, the head of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in the State Parliament of Thuringia since 2020, welcomed the initiative, saying Martina Schweinsburg is demonstrating to other authorities how to get refugee policy in order.
""What the federal and state governments cannot do, strong local communities do,"" he said, as quoted by Bild.
Several other districts have acknowledged the positive impact of the measure and said they will follow suit.

The juvenile/CCL was incidentally lodged at Observation Home, RS Pura, Jammu, in another case and registered at Gursai Police Station, Mendhar, District Poonch, the NIA stated.
He was taken into custody yesterday by the NIA and produced before the Juvenile Justice Board, Rajouri, for remand.
""The said terrorist attack had taken place on January 1, 2023, and five persons belonging to the minority Hindu community were killed and several seriously injured. The case was initially registered as FIR no. 01/2023 at PS Rajouri u/s 302/ 307 /120-B/452/323 of IPC, sections 13/16/18 of the UA (P) Act 1967 and sections 7/27 of the Arms Act. The NIA had taken over and re-registered the case on January 13,"" they added.
Investigations by the NIA had revealed that the apprehended juvenile, along with two other earlier arrested persons, namely Nisar Ahmed alias Haji Nisar and Mushtaq Hussain alias Chacha, was involved in harbouring the terrorists who had carried out the horrendous attack.
""Nisar Ahmed and Mushtaq Hussain were arrested by the NIA on August 31, 2023, and are presently lodged at Central Jail, Kot Bhalwal, Jammu,"" they added.
The duo had provided logistic support to the terrorists for more than two months and had sheltered them in a hideout that they had constructed on the directions of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) handlers, namely Saifullah alias Sajid Jutt, Abu Qatal alias Qatal Sindhi and Mohd Qasim, the NIA stated.
A team of NIA officials had regularly camped in the hilly terrain of Rajouri, Poonch and Reasi districts of Jammu and Kashmir in search of the actual perpetrators of the offence during the course of investigations.
The team examined a large number of suspicious entities and later zeroed in on the above-mentioned accused persons who had provided logistic support to the terrorists.

Bratislava will block Ukraine's bid to join the US-led NATO alliance and will stand by a decision to stop supplying weaponry to the country, Prime Minister of Slovakia Robert Fico has said.
He made the remarks on Saturday ahead of his visit to meet his counterpart Denis Shmygal in the western Ukrainian city of Uzhgorod. Fico stressed that his trip serves solely ""humanitarian"" purposes and promised to openly communicate Bratislava's stance to Kiev on different issues, including potential accession to the EU or NATO membership.
""I will tell him that there are things on which we have completely different opinions,"" Fico told broadcaster RTVS. ""I will tell him that we respect them when it comes to joining the EU, but they must fulfill the conditions,"" he added, explaining that a situation where ""a country that absolutely does not meet any requirements"" joins the EU is unacceptable.
He ruled out any possibility of Ukraine joining NATO, insisting such a move would only result in a global catastrophe, due to a possible direct collision between the bloc and Russia.
Fico also promised to reiterate to Shmygal his election campaign pledge to stop providing Kiev with weaponry, stating that the decision remains in force. However, the restriction applies only to state-sponsored military aid to Ukraine and supplies coming from national stocks, but arms manufacturers are free to sell to the country whatever they like, he noted.
""When Slovak companies don't make money, American ones will,"" Fico noted.
Prior to Fico assuming office following his party's electoral victory in September, Slovakia had been among Kiev's top supporters, lavishly supplying it with sophisticated weaponry, including warplanes and anti-aircraft systems. The policy of the previous government has also left the country's own defense posture badly damaged, new Defense Minister Robert Kalinak claimed earlier this week.
""The former government left us without our own anti-aircraft defenses, without combat aviation, and we don't even have the promised 700 million for MiGs, which the government also handed over to Ukraine,"" Kalinak told the Standard newspaper.

The third-day sessions have delved into crucial topics related to sustainability within the agricultural and livestock sector, including the latest developments in wheat production, such as new wheat breeds, and the application of international best practices in wheat cultivation.
The discussions are particularly significant in the UAE, with Sharjah playing a pivotal role in food security. The event is organized in collaboration with the Sharjah Chamber of Commerce and Industry and with the support from the Department of Agriculture and Livestock.
Attracting a significant number of farm owners and agricultural professionals, the exhibition showcases cutting-edge technologies and equipment in agricultural development. It has become a platform for introducing innovative solutions in hydroponics, vertical farming, advanced irrigation, and horticulture techniques.
Attendees also have the opportunity to avail themselves of the services offered by various entities and institutions participating in the exhibition, which are instrumental in enhancing production and achieving self-sufficiency.

The tally also includes 760 casualties from the past day.
Russia has also lost a number of vehicles and equipment in the fight, according to the report, including 11,466 armored fighting vehicles, 11,862 vehicles and fuel tanks, and 6,181 tanks. Russia has not commented on the latest numbers.
Dozens were killed or injured Sunday in shelling on a market on the outskirts of the city of Donetsk in Russian-occupied Ukraine.
Alexei Kulemzin, the Russian-installed mayor of Tekstilshchik, said the shelling came from Ukraine.
Elsewhere Sunday, a fire erupted at Novatek, a Russian liquefied gas producer on the Baltic Sea. No casualties have been reported.
The cause of the fire was not immediately clear, but drones were reported to have been detected in the area.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed concern over the prospect of Donald Trump returning to the White House and said he considers the former U.S. president's claims that he could stop Ukraine's war with Russia in 24 hours ""very dangerous.""
In an interview with the U.K.'s Channel 4 News that aired Friday, Zelenskyy invited the former president and front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination to visit Kyiv, provided Trump delivers on his promise in a way that can satisfy Ukraine.
""Donald Trump, I invite you to Ukraine, to Kyiv. If you can stop the war during 24 hours, I think it will be enough to come,"" Zelenskyy said.
The Ukrainian leader expressed concern over a potential Trump presidency, in which Trump's idea of a negotiated peace in Ukraine might involve Ukraine making major concessions to Russia.
""[Trump] is going to make decisions on his own, without ... I'm not even talking about Russia, but without both sides, without us,' Zelenskyy said. ""If he says this publicly, that's a little scary. I've seen a lot, a lot of victims, but that's really making me a bit stressed.""
Trump has repeatedly stated that he is well-positioned to negotiate an end to the war that has raged for almost two years, saying he has a good relationship with both Russian and Ukrainian leaders.
Throughout his political career, he has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, including after Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
During a campaign rally in Georgia just days after Russian tanks moved into Ukraine, Trump described Putin as a ""smart"" political player and expressed admiration for Russia's swift takeover of a vast, ""great piece of land' at the cost of what he suggested were relatively minor sanctions.
Zaporizhzhia Power Plant - mines
International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi warned Saturday that mines had been replanted around the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, just months after a team of international inspectors had reported the area had been cleared from mines.
In a statement on the agency's website, Grossi cautioned that mines in the plant's buffer zone, between its internal and external fences, go against the agency's safety standards.
The head of Ukraine's state nuclear company, Petro Kotin of Energoatom, called the alleged planting of mines as ""another crime"" by Russian forces that have occupied the Zaporizhzhia plant since the early weeks of the war.
In a Telegram update Saturday, Kotin said the situation at the plant ""will remain fragile and dangerous as long as the Russians remain there.""
The IAEA has repeatedly expressed concern the war could cause a potential radiation leak from the facility, which is one of world's 10 biggest nuclear power stations.
The plant's six reactors have been shut down for months, but it still needs power and qualified staff to operate crucial cooling systems and other safety features.
Russia has been in control of the site since 2022 and is refusing to allow IAEA experts access to some areas of the plant.
'Such access is needed to monitor nuclear safety and security,' the IAEA statement said.
Russia's crackdown
Russian lawmakers have prepared a bill allowing for the confiscation of money and property from people who spread 'deliberately false information' about the country's armed forces, a senior member of parliament said Saturday.
Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma, said the measure would also apply to those found guilty of what he described as other forms of betrayal such as 'discrediting' the armed forces, calling for sanctions against Russia or inciting extremist activity.
'Everyone who tries to destroy Russia, who betrays it, must face deserved punishment and compensate for the damage inflicted on the country, at the cost of their own property,' Volodin wrote on Telegram.
Meanwhile, at the election headquarters of President Vladimir Putin, the wife of a Russian soldier delivered an emotional appeal Saturday for her husband's return from the front, a defiant gesture in a country where open criticism of the war is banned.
'Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin has issued a decree that my husband has to be there [in Ukraine.] I'm interested to know when he will issue a decree that my husband has to be home,' Maria Andreyeva said as campaign workers looked on.
Andreyeva became involved in a heated exchange with a woman who told her that Russian soldiers in Ukraine were defending the motherland, and she should pray for them.
'So, what's next? The Ministry of Defense has spent its money, now we need to squeeze everything out of our guys, get the last life out of them? So that they come back to us just as stumps?' Andreyeva questioned.
'Will they give me the stump? What will I get back? A man without legs, without arms, a sick man? Don't you know what's happening there?"" she asked.

An essential move to ensure a delicate balance between driving growth, and sustaining profitability.
Tata Motors Decision on Price Surge - A Common Industry Practice

This proactive approach is not only specific to a manufacturer but is integral to the operational dynamics of manufacturers worldwide. It enables companies to navigate the complexities of production expenses, ensuring the continued delivery of efficient, innovative, and competitive vehicles.
Understanding the intricacies of input costs involves considering raw materials, labour, and other production expenses.

Israel's own estimates placed the starting number of Hamas fighters higher, at 30,000 or more, and credited the Israel Defense Forces with killing more members of the group - 9,000 during the war plus 1,000 during the raid that preceded it. Its estimate of 16,000 wounded Palestinian militants was also notably higher, as was its claim regarding the seriousness of those wounds - half of the injured won't be fighting anymore, a senior Israeli military official told the WSJ.
The US has tacitly acknowledged the failure of Israel's three-month bombardment of Gaza to bring about the destruction of Hamas, its stated goal in waging war on the enclave. The administration of President Joe Biden has repeatedly urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reduce civilian casualties and adopt a more ""surgical"" strategy targeting high-ranking members of the organization rather than low-level fighters, even while lowering its own expectations from the obliteration of Hamas to its degradation as a security threat.
In announcing the withdrawal of thousands of troops from Gaza earlier this month, West Jerusalem, too, appeared to acknowledge the failure of its scorched-earth tactics, which have killed nearly 25,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The high reported rate of civilian casualties has triggered allegations of genocidal intent from the international community, culminating in a case filed by South Africa against Israel in the International Court of Justice."

Ninth-seeded Barbora Krejcikova overcame a first-set setback to post a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 win over Mirra Andreeva on Sunday to advance to the quarterfinals of the Australian Open in Melbourne.
In the process, Krejcikova avenged a pair of losses to Andreeva in 2023, including one at Wimbledon.
TheCzech toppled the 16-year-old Russian in one hour, 59 minutes to set up a match against defending champion Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus. Krejcikova advanced to the quarterfinals of this tournament for the second time, having also done so in 2022.
""I'm really happy that I'm in a quarterfinal because I had really difficult matches,"" Krejcikova said. ""To compare it with the last time, I don't really remember the last time, so I don't really remember the feelings and the emotions that I had.
""This year, it's a new year. It's a different tournament. I just go on and I just fight for every single ball.""
Krejcikova rebounded from a difficult first set to record 28 winners to just 18 unforced errors over the final two sets.
The Czech won the French Open in 2021. Her only other quarterfinals appearance in a Grand Slam came in 2021 at the U.S. Open.
Sabalenka, the second seed, made quick work of American Amanda Anisimova, recording a 6-3, 6-2 win in 70 minutes.
In reaching the quarterfinals, Sabalenka has yet to drop a set and has not allowed more than three games in a set to any opponent.
""I'm super happy with the level. Happy to get this win,"" Sabalenka said, spotting fans wearing T-shirts that spelled out A-R-Y-N-A, pointing to them and smiling. ""That's why I'm getting stronger because I enjoy the atmosphere so much.""
Sabalenka has won five of six career matches against Krejcikova.
Also Sunday, American Coco Gauff rolled to a 6-1, 6-2 win over Poland's Magdalena Frech in 63 minutes.
The fourth-seeded Gauff took command in the first set, delivering eight winners to just two for Frech, who also committed 12 unforced errors.
Gauff offset a 40 percent mark in first-serve percentage by owning a second-serve, points-won percentage of 89.
Gauff said she was honored to play in Rod Laver Arena -- in front of Rod Laver himself -- and talked about the inspirational messages on her shoes that she wore in the victory.
One of the messages is ""'You can change the world with your racket,'"" she said, ""something my dad told me since I was a little girl. And an inspiration of why I always feel like it's important to speak up and speak out about certain issues.""
Gauff, 19, next fwill ace Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine, who continued the trend of straight-sets victories Sunday, disposing of Maria Timofeeva of Russia, 6-2, 6-1.
Kostyuk had 19 winners and converted four of her five break points, while Timofeeva was 0-for-4 on break chances and committed 20 unforced errors.

DGP Vijay Kumar said, ""A large number of devotees are already present in Ayodhya, who are staying in religious places, Dharamshalas, and Ashrams. The managers of those ashrams should be urged that all the devotees should not go for darshan together. After January 22, arrangements for darshan should be made in order.""He issued a directive that an intensive checking campaign should be conducted at all check posts.
Vijay Kumar said, ""Intensive checking should be done on the Indo-Nepal border, the interstate border, and the border of Ayodhya and its adjoining districts.""He said that the services of vehicles related to the supply of essential commodities should not be disrupted.
He directed police officials to behave politely with the devotees visiting Ayodhya.
Police deployed for security in the Saryu River should be kept active.
There should be no carelessness in checking vehicles at the border, he said.
""Suspicious vehicle or person should be thoroughly searched and interrogated. Strict action should be taken immediately against those who post objectionable posts on social media, he said.
The state government has sprung into action to deal with the growing concern over a surge in cybercriminal activity related to the 'Pran Pratishtha' ceremony of Lord Shri Ram Lalla in Ayodhya Dham.
As false messages claiming to collect donations for Ram Janmabhoomi, along with deceptive promises of providing free Prasad, VIP passes and entry passes, are circulating, the Yogi government is taking proactive measures to address and counteract these malicious activities.
Instructions have been issued to the entire state police, particularly the Ayodhya Police, to maintain heightened vigilance. In a recent incident, Ayodhya Police acted swiftly, arresting an Indian American citizen involved in similar activities and putting him in jail under relevant sections. The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust is also alerting all devotees about these deceptive practices. (ANI)"

A4KB7ZJ9T8_1M95QKHI164FPWY,What Would Happen in US Election if Trump or Biden Dropped Out,"Voice of America 21st January 2024, 19:35 GMT+11","Voice of America 21st January 2024, 19:35 GMT+11",20240121,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274101804/what-would-happen-in-us-election-if-trump-or-biden-dropped-out,"President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are on track for a rematch in the presidential election on November 5. Polls show that Trump holds a commanding lead over all other Republican candidates, while no major Democratic figure is challenging Biden for his party's nomination.
However, questions about Trump's legal difficulties and both candidates' ages lurk in the background. Trump faces 91 felony charges, with at least one criminal trial expected this year. And health issues could affect either Trump, 77, or Biden, 81.
What would happen should either of them be forced to drop out of the race because of health, legal or other reasons? The answer depends on when such a scenario occurs.
Between January 15 and party conventions
States hold caucuses and primary elections between January 15 and June 4, 2024. The two candidates who win the most delegates will officially become their parties' nominees during the conventions. The Republican National Convention will be July 15-18 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Democratic National Convention will take place August 19-22 in Chicago, Illinois.
Both Trump and Biden are expected to be nominated by their respective parties. But should one drop out between the start of the caucus-primary season and his party's convention, some states may extend candidate filing deadlines and primary dates to allow more people into the race, depending on when it occurs.
Such extensions are more likely to happen with Democrats, as Biden has no significant competitor. His challengers, Representative Dean Phillips and author Marianne Williamson, lack name recognition and already do not qualify to be on the ballots of several states.
""They would want there to be a semblance of the primaries,"" said John C. Fortier, a research fellow focusing on elections and continuity of government at the American Enterprise Institute. ""It would be very short notice, but they would get to go before the people,"" he told VOA.
Even with processes in place, there may not be time to change the names on the ballots, and primary voters may end up seeing the name of a deceased or incapacitated candidate when they vote. With early voting allowed by some states, a candidate who dropped out might already have collected votes.
In that instance, states may enact emergency changes in laws to allow delegates to switch their votes to a new candidate during the convention. To win at the nomination, a Republican candidate needs at least 1,215 out of 2,429 delegates, and a Democratic candidate needs 1,969 out of 3,936.
""It may not be someone who is currently in the race,"" said Michael Thorning, director of structural democracy at the Bipartisan Policy Institute. ""It might be someone that the convention determines is the best standard bearer for the party and the person most likely to win in the general election,"" he told VOA.
Between conventions and Election Day
Each party has its own set of rules should its candidate drop out during this period, but in essence it would replace the candidate's name on the presidential ballot. Emergency changes to some state laws may be required.
""There is a technical process where not the whole convention but a smaller group of people who lead the party, people who are really not known to Americans, can make that decision to put someone else as the nominee,"" Fortier said. He added that the parties would likely need to make an appeal to the American people and explain to them why the new candidate has legitimacy.
While Vice President Kamala Harris could be asked to be the top of the Democratic ticket, for example, it's not required by law.
""The running-mate status at that point does not confer any guarantee that they would accede to the presidency,"" Thorning said.
Again, there may not be time to replace the name of the former candidate on the ballots, and that candidate may already have votes because of early polling.
Between Election Day and Electoral College meeting
After questions or challenges about election results are settled, electors in each state will meet on December 17 to select the president-elect and vice president-elect.
Should Trump or Biden die or become incapacitated during this time, his vice president-elect would not automatically be the replacement, as provisions of the presidential line of succession law do not yet apply.
The replacement process during this period is essentially the same: Electors of the president-elect would vote for a new candidate. There is no federal guidance on the process, and some states have their own rules on how electors vote.
The vice president-elect would be a logical choice but not one guaranteed by law.
If the electors cannot agree on a new president-elect, under the 12th Amendment, the House of Representatives would elect the president, and the Senate would elect the vice president, in a procedure known as ""contingent election.""
Until Congress appoints a new president-elect, under the 20th Amendment, the vice president-elect becomes acting president.
Between Electoral College meeting and congressional certification
It's not clear what would happen if a candidate dies or becomes incapacitated between the December 17 meeting of electors and the January 6 counting and certification of electoral votes in Congress.
Between congressional certification and Inauguration Day
According to the 20th Amendment, the vice president-elect would be inaugurated as president on January 20, 2025, if the president-elect dies or is incapacitated after Congress certifies the election result.
In each period, there is the potential for a legal and political crisis, particularly if the election result is contested as it was in 2020. With Democrats holding a slim majority in the Senate and Republicans in the House of Representatives, figuring out who will become the next president could become an extremely messy process that drags on in the courts.
And as the country witnessed during the siege of the Capitol by Trump supporters on January 6, 2021, it could again turn bloody."

The 'Pran Pratistha' of Ram Lalla is scheduled on Paush Shukla Kurma Dwadashi, Vikram Samvat 2080, which falls on Monday, January 22.
The ceremonial journey leading up to the Pran Pratishtha included a seven-day ritual that commenced on January 16, 2024, Tuesday, following the classical traditions.
Meanwhile, Karsewakpuram, an area in Ayodhya where 'Karsevaks' had come and stayed in 1990, has now been fully decorated with flowers of various hues ahead of the Pran Pratishtha of Ram Temple tomorrow.
In 1990, when the then Mulayam Singh government passed orders to open fire at the Karsevaks, they came and stayed at Karsewakpuram during their struggle for the Ram Temple. The place is around two kilometres from the Ram Janmabhoomi site.
There used to be ground here in the past that was later gradually developed. The decoration at the same place today tells a lot about how times changed.
Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, General Secretary Champat Rai's residence, has also been decorated with twinkling lights.
Moreover, with only a few hours separating Ayodhya from Lord Ram's long-awaited return to his birthplace, a heavy security cordon has been thrown around the city, the state police informed on Sunday.
Even as the city exuded a festive ambience ahead of the big day, Rapid Action Force (RPF) personnel were deployed at Lata Mangeshkar Chowk ahead of the January 22 ceremony.
The police were conducting patrols by boat on the Sarayu River at frequent intervals, officers said.
Anti-bomb squad and dog squad teams were also deployed at Ayodhya's Maharishi Valmiki International Airport as devotees and dignitaries started pouring into the temple town.
Vehicles reaching and leaving the airport were being thoroughly checked and no one was being allowed to enter the airport without a pass, the officials said.
According to officials, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has set up a camp near the shrine in Ayodhya to respond to contingencies, if any.
""Three NDRF teams have been deployed here ahead of the 'Pran Pratishtha' ceremony on January 22. The deployment has been done in coordination with the local administration and police,"" Manoj Kumar Sharma, NDRF Deputy Inspector General of police, told ANI.
Praveen Kumar, IG, Ayodhya, said that necessary preparations in coordination with the agencies concerned have already been made to ensure watertight security in the city.
""The visitors have already started arriving for the 'Pran Pratishtha'. We are ensuring close surveillance through drone cameras and human intelligence. All security loopholes are being identified and addressed with priority. We are confident that the mega event on January 22 will pass off without a hitch,"" the Ayodhya IG said.
The ceremonial journey leading up to the Pran Pratishtha commenced on January 16, 2024, Tuesday.
Earlier, on Thursday, January 19, the idol of Shri Ram Lalla, carved by renowned Mysuru sculptor Arun Yogiraj, was placed inside the sanctum sanctorum of the temple.
Covered with a veil, the first photo of the idol was revealed during the placement ceremony in the sanctum sanctorum on Thursday.
The grand occasion will witness the participation of dignitaries and people from all walks of life.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to attend the installation of the idol of Ram Lalla at the grand temple on January 22.
Laxmikant Dixit, a priest from Varanasi, will lead the team of priests performing the main rituals of the Pran Pratishta. (ANI)"

Also Sunday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced on X, formerly Twitter, that he was ending his Republican presidential campaign ahead of the primary, failing to meet expectations that he would emerge as a serious challenger to Trump.
A new CNN poll Sunday showed Trump with 50% of the prospective New Hampshire vote, easily topping the 39% figure for Nikki Haley, his one-time ambassador to the United Nations, and 6% for DeSantis. The survey results were in line with recent polling in the state by other news organizations.
Trump won last week's caucuses in the reliably Republican midwestern farm state of Iowa, collecting more than 50% of the vote, easily doubling the vote for both DeSantis and Haley, who also is a former governor from the southern state of South Carolina.
Trump and Haley traded barbs throughout the weekend, while DeSantis visited South Carolina and made a return trip to New Hampshire before ending his run for the White House.
The South Carolina party primary is more than a month away. But Trump attempted this weekend to diminish Haley's standing in her home state. An array of South Carolina officials who endorsed Trump traveled to New Hampshire, more than 1,300 kilometers (about 807.8 miles) away, to speak on his behalf.
""To the people of New Hampshire,"" Trump told supporters at a rally, ""All you need to know about Nikki Haley is that every globalist, liberal, Biden supporter and 'Never Trumper' is on her side - and virtually every single leader ... in her home state of South Carolina is on our side. We have almost everybody.""
Republican presidential candidate former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley speaks during a campaign event in Derry, New Hampshire, Jan. 21, 2024.
Trump has also suggested that somehow Haley, who was born in the United States to Indian immigrants, is not American enough. He has repeatedly referred to her on his Truth Social media platform as ""Nimbra,"" an apparent intentional misspelling of her birth name, Nimarata Nikki Randhawa. When she married Michael Haley 26 years ago, she adopted his surname and has used it professionally since then.
Trump is trying the reclaim the White House after losing his 2020 reelection bid to Democrat Joe Biden, with polls showing both are favored to win their parties' nomination for a rematch that many U.S. voters say they do not want but one that appears inevitable.
Haley has claimed that at 77, Trump's mental acuity is declining, and contended that neither he nor the 81-year-old Biden should lead the country.
In a speech over the weekend, Trump blamed Haley by name four times for the lack of security at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, when 2,000 Trump supporters stormed into the building to try to halt congressional certification of Biden's victory.
Trump never corrected himself but apparently was referring to another political nemesis, former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Haley has never served in Congress and says she was in South Carolina at the time of the riot at the Capitol.
""If you look recently, there have been multiple things: I mean, he claimed that Joe Biden was going to get us into World War II. I'm assuming he meant World War III,"" Haley said. ""He said that he ran against President Obama. He never ran against President Obama. He says that I'm the one that kept security from the Capitol on January 6. I was nowhere near the Capitol on January 6.""
""Don't be surprised if you have someone that's 80 in office, their mental stability is going to continue to decline,"" Haley said Sunday. ""That's just human nature.""
Haley claimed that Trump is ""just not at the same level he was at 2016,"" when he won the presidency. ""I think we're seeing some of that decline."""

Chief Minister Jagan Reddy is currently in power in Andhra Pradesh while the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) ruled the state until the year 2019.
Addressing the media after assuming charge of the APCC chief, YS Sharmila said, ""It is a matter of pride that all the leaders of the Congress party trusted me. The YSRCP has been in power in Andhra Pradesh for the last five years. Before that, TDP was in power. There has been no progress in these 10 years.""Sharmila claimed that, at present, Andhra Pradesh is striving for funds.
""Chandrababu didn't build proper capital. Jagan announced three capitals but he failed to build a single capital. Andhra Pradesh does not have at least one metro. They (current and previous governments) have taken on so much debt but development is seen only in the vanity box,"" she said.
""If all the previous and current debts are added together, the debt incurred by the state is 10 lakh crores,"" the APCC chief added.
Continuing her attack on the Jagan Reddy-led Andhra government, Sharmila said, ""Not even 10 new big industries have come up in the last 10 years. Not even a single industry has come to Andhra Pradesh. No job calendar was released for unemployed youth. There was no development but attacks on Dalits have increased 100 per cent. YSRCP pledges state interests for self-interest. There is not even one special package for the state.""The Andhra Congress chief further alleged that the YSRCP and TDP are having a secret alliance with the BJP. ""All their MPs are bowing their heads before the BJP,"" she said.
Targeting the Centre for ""ignoring the interests of Andhra Pradesh"", Sharmila said that the ""BJP has been in power for 10 years. It said that it would provide 2 crore jobs every year but in reality, out of 2 crore jobs, how many jobs did our Andhra get? No new jobs. Also, existing jobs will disappear if this continues. The BJP could not provide even one lakh jobs in Andhra.""Sharmila also claimed that currently, there is not one farmer in the country who is living without debt on his head.
""BJP is in power at the national level and has cheated the farmers. There is no farmer in the country without debt. Bring money back from the Swiss bank and invest in farmers' accounts,"" she said.
On the occasion, Sharmila remembered her father, YS Rajasekhara Reddy (also known as YSR), who was also the former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. Sharmila said that those who truly loved his father must support Congress to fulfil his vision.
""YSR's ambitions were fulfilled by Congress. YSR had Congress origins until his last breath. People who love YSR must stand up. Join hands with me. Let's prepare to achieve the ambitions of YSR again in Andhra Pradesh,"" she said.
YS Sharmila joined the Congress earlier this month. She also merged her party, the YSR Telangana Party, into Congress. The Congress on Tuesday appointed YS Sharmila Reddy, sister of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, as president of the party in the poll-bound state. (ANI)"

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis shut down his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination on Sunday, endorsing the party's frontrunner, former US president Donald Trump, just two days before residents of New Hampshire were scheduled to vote in the country's second primary.
DeSantis announced his exit from the race in a video posted on X (formerly Twitter), accompanying the footage with a quote from former UK prime minister Winston Churchill that left the door open to another run: ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.""
Acknowledging there was no ""clear path to victory"" following his second-place finish in Iowa, where he lost to Trump by some 30 points, DeSantis reasoned that Trump was a better choice for commander-in-chief than incumbent President Joe Biden - or the next Republican runner-up, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley.
""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,"" DeSantis explained, insisting, ""If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome -more campaign stops, more interviews - I would do it.""
The Florida governor is term-limited, meaning he will be leaving the statehouse in January 2027 - just in time for another run at the Oval Office.
Former biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy also endorsed Trump after suspending his own presidential campaign earlier this month, having finished fourth with 8% of the vote in the Iowa caucuses.
Trump has not revealed his choice of running mate for 2024, and some X users speculated that DeSantis was angling for the job by minimizing his differences with the reality TV star turned politician while attacking his strongest Republican competitor Haley, whose platform he described as ""warmed-over corporatism.""
The Republican frontrunner's eldest son, Donald Trump, Jr., had put DeSantis - along with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and one-time Republican candidate Ben Carson - forward as a potential vice presidential pick last week. The elder Trump did not explicitly rule out the possibility when asked about it last year.

An American military drone ""crashed"" on Thursday night near Baghdad, the Pentagon has told multiple media outlets, while declining to offer further details.
The incident comes weeks after a UAV strike killed a local militia leader in the Iraqi capital, drawing condemnation from the country's government.
The drone went down near Balad air base, around 70km (43 miles) north of Baghdad, an unnamed defense official said in a statement obtained by AFP, RIA Novosti, and other news agencies.
""Iraqi security forces recovered the aircraft. There were no injuries reported,"" the official said on Friday, adding that ""an investigation of the cause of the crash is underway.""
While the official gave no indication of whether the drone suffered a technical issue or was downed by enemy fire, the admission came just hours after a local militia group - the Islamic Resistance in Iraq - claimed to have targeted a US MQ-9 Reaper, which are used for both surveillance and air strikes.
""Mujahideen yesterday targeted... an MQ-9 drone belonging to the American occupation,"" the group said in a statement on Friday.
Unconfirmed footage purporting to show the expensive US drone plummeting from the sky engulfed in flames has made the rounds online - while another clip appeared to depict the aftermath of the crash, with debris seen scattered on the ground.
Washington has launched a series of deadly strikes on Iraq and Syria in recent months, most targeting militia groups with alleged links to Iran. An American drone strike on Baghdad earlier this month killed militia leader Mushtaq Jawad Kazim al-Jawari, who headed up Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, a Shia armed group said to have ties to the Islamic Resistance faction.
A military spokesman for Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani condemned the strike as an ""unjustified attack on an Iraqi security entity"" that was operating with official authorization. Al-Jawari had served as a commander in the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), a loose collection of state-sanctioned paramilitaries formed in 2014 to help beat back Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS).
Another high-profile US drone strike near the Baghdad International Airport in January 2020 resulted in the death of PMF deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, as well as Qassem Solemani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force. That attack was also denounced by Baghdad, with then-PM Adel Abdul Mahdi calling it ""aggression on Iraq as a state, government and people.""

The port will provide China with a direct gateway to the region and its valuable resources, including soy, corn, and copper.
Majority-owned by Chinese state-owned company Cosco Shipping, the port will be the first controlled by China in South America. It will also be able to accommodate the largest cargo ships that can travel directly to Asia, cutting the journey time by as much as two weeks.
In an interview with Reuters, Juan Mathews Salazar, trade minister of Peru, said, ""The Chancay mega port aims to turn Peru into a strategic commercial and port hub between South America and Asia.""
The new port is part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, which has enabled Beijing to win new economic allies and gain leverage in political forums, finance, and technology.
Full construction of the port began in 2018 at Chancay, some 50 miles north of Lima, and its first phase is set to be completed in November 2024.
Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is expected to attend an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Peru that month, could inaugurate the mega port.
Mario de las Casas, corporate affairs manager for Cosco Shipping, which holds a 60 percent stake in the port, said, ""It is part of China's new Silk Road.""
The remaining 40 percent stake in the port is owned by the local mine company Volcan.
The project would accelerate regional development, said Jose Adriano da Silva, a farming entrepreneur from Brazil's western Acre state who visited the port.
Clemente Baena Soares, Ambassador of Brazil to Peru, who also visited Chancay in September, said, ""It is an opportunity for grain and meat production, especially from Rondonia, Acre, Mato Grosso and Amazonas, to go to Asia through the port of Chancay.""
""Brazilian businesses are delighted with the possibility of not using the Panama Canal to take their goods to Asia,"" he added.
China surpassed the U.S. on trade in South and Central America under former President Donald Trump, and under President Joe Biden, the gap has widened despite attempts to reverse it."

Shah's direction came while chairing a review meeting of the LWE situation in Chhattisgarh at Raipur. The meeting was attended by Chhattisgarh's Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Ministers as well as senior officials including Union Home Secretary, Director Intelligence Bureau, Chief Secretary of Chhattisgarh, Director General of Central Reserve Police Force, and DGP of Chhattisgarh.
""He (Amit Shah) observed that on account of the combined efforts of the security forces and all the Central and State agencies, the LWE problem has been essentially confined to some pockets within Chhattisgarh. In this context, the Minister mentioned that these areas need to be freed from the Maoist menace within the next three years,"" Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement.
In this context, Shah emphasised the need for a detailed roadmap to be drawn up by all the concerned stakeholders, particularly relating to the targeting of the entire ecosystem-sustaining LWE.
Further, the Union Home Minister directed the state police to fill up the remnant security gaps, ensure comprehensive investigations, closely monitor prosecution, choke finance streams and continue intelligence-led operations. He also stressed the need to review all inputs shared through the multi-agency center and operationalize verified inputs.
The Minister stressed the need for saturation coverage of Central and State Govt. schemes in LWE-affected districts and utilization of security force camps to ensure the benefits of these schemes in villages in proximate areas.
He mentioned that the MHA should be flexible both in the allotment of funds as also its usage in the highly LWE-affected districts in Chhattisgarh.
He also highlighted the need for a proactive and sensitive handling of all local grievances about bonafide entitlements. Subsequently, on the directions of the Union Home Minister, a detailed interaction was held by the Union Home Secretary with the Collectors and SSPs of the highly LWE- affected districts.
The Home Minister pointed out that the three internal security situations in JK, North East and LWE have witnessed a significant improvement with a nearly 75 per cent reduction in violence and geographical constriction by nearly 80 per cent.
He also mentioned that the Armed Forces Special Power Act has now been withdrawn from close to 80 per cent of the areas in the North East.

According to the official statement issued by the LG office, the move, apart from helping applicants at large, will specifically benefit the country's shooting sportspersons.
""Following a decisive push by LG VK Saxena to rationalize and ease the licensing processes, in line with ""Ease of Doing Business"", Delhi Police has initiated a major reform in the grant of arms licenses, till now marred by complaints of favoritism, corruption, and arbitrariness. The move apart from helping applicants at large, will specifically benefit the country's shooting sportspersons,"" it said.
It further said that the LG has directed the Delhi Police to issue fresh licenses to renowned shooters with ""all India"" validity instead of validity within Delhi only, as they frequently need to travel across the country for various sporting events.
Further, their cartridge quota has also been significantly increased from 20 to 10,000 annually, with one-time cartridge procurement increasing from 10 at present to 1000, it added.
Apart from the speedy disposal of pending applications, it will also be ensured that fresh applications are disposed of in a timely manner through an online portal, which will be modified specifically for this purpose.
The LG has also directed rationalizing the renewal of arms licenses.
In a departure from the present system where the online portal does not prescribe any timeline for the arms licensing procedures, Saxena has asked Delhi Police to make all services, viz. fresh licenses, renewal, area validity, registration, sale of arms, etc. time-bound.
""LG has asked the police to expedite the disposal of all nearly 6000 pending applications by the end of 2024. Similarly, all redundant documents required for fresh licenses as well as renewal are being reviewed and those found unnecessary will be removed subsequently,"" it added.
LG has also directed to make the modified arms licensing portal operational by March-end.
The modified portal will provide the applicants the liberty to schedule the date and time of their interview online as per their convenience, preferably via video conference or video call, cutting possibilities of a human interface that often leads to harassment and corruption.
As per the statement, the move comes after LG Saxena successfully managed to get licensing requirements for eateries and lodging establishments rationalized and simplified, followed by a major rationalization of the Amusement Policy.
""The reforms aim at making the licensing regime transparent by curtailing the highhandedness and extreme interference of government officials and promoting a conducive atmosphere for individuals, businesses, and commercial establishments,"" it said.
The statement further said that the Delhi Police have already started granting provisional renewal during the pendency of the Local Police Report (LPR), after verifying the applicants' criminal record (if any) from the Inter-operable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) and State Crime Record Bureau (SCRB).
""In such cases, Delhi Police may revoke or cancel the renewal of the license in case it receives a negative police report in due course,"" it said.
Further, LG has directed to allow the renewal of arms licenses on a case-by-case basis, in case the applicants are involved in minor cases that do not involve the use of any weapon, bodily offense, or moral turpitude.
Similarly, for the registration of arms in Delhi that have been issued licenses in other Indian states, prior LPR and genuineness will not be required. Instead, registration in such cases will be done in Delhi on the basis of a report from the National Database of Arms Licences - Arms Licence Issuance System (NDAL - ALIS). (ANI)"

Commending their noteworthy accomplishments, he said, ""I was asking people how many factories have been built by our Indian returnees. They told me about the 900 factories that they had built since they came back.""Reflecting on Uganda's historical events, particularly the expulsion of Asians, primarily Indian Ugandans, during Idi Amin's regime, President Museveni openly acknowledged the mistakes made by the government.
He said, ""NAM countries also sometimes make mistakes like here in Uganda."" He recounted the adverse consequences of Amin's actions, including the economic impact on his country. India during Amin's time had cut ties with his regime due to his actions.
President Museveni noted the adverse impact of Amin's decisions on the country's economy, saying, ""You had a leader of a NAM country undermining his own economy."" The expelled individuals were actively involved in various sectors, including sugar, hotels, and steel production.
Expressing remorse, the president lamented the lost opportunities for growth and development during that tumultuous period. President Museveni reflected on the measures undertaken by the Ugandan government to address and rectify past injustices.
""So therefore it is very crucial that we study very carefully the issue of the investment climate in our respective countries. When we kicked out all these people and we came into government, we brought back, we gave back the properties of our Asian citizens and non-citizens that Idi Amin had taken. We gave them back. We had a hot debate in parliament, some people saying this. We said, no, they must get back their properties. And they got their properties,"" he added.
At the outset of his address, he also recognised India's pivotal role in the establishment of the NAM group and the nation's participation in the inaugural NAM summit in Belgrade in 1961.
""This group of countries, accounts for 4.46 billions of people of the World. It was started by our far-sighted elders in the persons of Sukarno of Indonesia, Pt Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Nasser of Egypt and Chou En Lai of China,"" he said.

Senior Russian diplomat Mikhail Ulyanov has argued that there is nothing ""sensational"" about the presence of landmines in the buffer zone near the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, highlighted by the International Atomic Energy Agency earlier this week.
The Zaporozhye NPP, the largest facility of its kind in Europe, has been under Russian control since the outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine two years ago, and has hosted the UN nuclear watchdog's monitoring mission since September 2022. On Friday, the IAEA noted in a statement that ""mines along the perimeter of the ZNPP... are now back in place.""
""The mines are located between the outer and inner fences of the station. This is a closed 'buffer' zone. Mines pose a threat only to rats, crows and potential saboteurs,"" Ulyanov, who represents Moscow at several Vienna-based international organizations, wrote in a Telegram post on Saturday.
The UN watchdog repeatedly declined to assess who was responsible for sporadic drone attacks, shellings and other security incidents involving the facility. Ukraine and its backers have repeatedly accused Russia of undermining nuclear safety, even as Kiev's top military spy Kirill Budanov admitted to at least three botched Ukrainian attempts to retake ZNPP.
None of Kiev's commando operations managed to establish a Ukrainian foothold in the nearby city of Energodar, located in the Zaporozhye region, which joined Russia following a referendum in 2022. However, Ukrainian officials claimed the expeditions gave them valuable experience and contributed to the larger goal of preventing Russia from using the plant to provide electricity to the region. The Zaporozhye station is in a state of partial shutdown, with a single reactor providing power for its own consumption.
Ulyanov noted that according to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM) it was up to the national authorities to determine and introduce ""other appropriate measures necessary for the physical protection of nuclear facilities."" Even the IAEA chief Rafael Grossi himself admitted last June that ""while the presence of any explosive device is not in line with safety standards, the main safety functions of the facility would not be significantly affected.""
The IAEA was fully aware of the mines and their removal last November, Ulyanov said, arguing that if now they have ""reappeared"" it only means that the Russian authorities deemed it a ""necessary"" security measure.

Stockpiling arms and ammunition in Ukraine makes ""little sense"" due to the ability of Russian forces to effectively identify and strike such locations, Kiev's air force spokesman has admitted. Yury Ignat also warned that US-made F-16 fighter jets could become ""a good target"" for Moscow if supplied to Ukraine.
Kiev has increasingly complained about a lack of ammunition supplies from the West in recent months. However, speaking to local media outlet Focus on Saturday, Ignat suggested that the Ukrainian military would not be able to stockpile large quantities of ammunition anyway, due to the threat of it being swiftly destroyed by Russia.
""We cannot take a huge number of missiles,"" Ignat said, commenting on stockpiles for air defense systems. ""One has to store them somewhere and the enemy will know about it sooner or later.""
The air force spokesman also admitted that it made ""little sense to place entire ammunition depots in Ukraine"" since Russian intelligence was effective at identifying such locations. This was also true for F-16 fighter jets, he stated, asking: ""Will they just arrive here and become a good target for the enemy?""
Western countries announced the creation of a coalition to help Ukraine procure F-16 fighter jets and train pilots to fly the warplanes last year, and the first deliveries are expected later in 2024. The Netherlands and Denmark have spearheaded the effort, promising to donate up to 61 of the aircraft. Earlier in January, Ignat warned that operating both US-made and Soviet-era warplanes would be an ""extremely difficult"" challenge for Ukrainian troops.
Speaking on Saturday, the air force spokesman also admitted that Ukrainian air defenses would still be ineffective against Russian offensive capabilities regardless of Western supplies, citing the sheer number of S-300 missiles that Moscow possesses, making it impossible to shoot them all down. The Soviet-made S-300 systems are primarily designed for air defense and are capable of intercepting both cruise and ballistic missiles as well as shooting down aircraft. At the same time, they can also potentially be used to strike ground targets.
Kiev's defense minister, Rustem Umerov, stated earlier this month that the nation's military was facing a ""very real"" ammunition shortage. Elsewhere, Western media outlets such as the Washington Post, El Pais, and Die Welt have all described an acute ammunition deficit for Ukrainian troops on the front lines.
In mid-January, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky stated that the world was not producing enough weapons to satisfy Kiev's needs. Those remarks echoed comments by Ukraine's strategic industries minister, Aleksandr Kamyshin, who claimed in October that the entire global arms production was ""not enough"" for his country.

Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump has countered claims that his possible reelection to the White House poses an existential risk to the American way of life, telling supporters in the US state of New Hampshire on Saturday that it is Joe Biden's 'incompetence' that represents the real threat to democracy.
Trump was speaking in Manchester ahead of primary elections beginning on Tuesday that could further cement his status as the likely GOP candidate to challenge presumptive Democratic nominee Biden in November.
But after being accused earlier this month by Biden of being ""willing to sacrifice democracy,"" the former US president turned the tables on his political rival, saying that Biden's incapacity for the job is a clear and present danger to the United States.
""He is a threat to democracy,"" Trump said, his comments delivered under a giant sign reading: 'Biden attacks democracy.' He added: ""We have to get him out. You know why he is a threat to democracy? A couple of reasons, but you know the first reason? He's grossly incompetent.""
It is an accusation that Trump has repeated on several occasions throughout his bid to return to the White House. In October, he blamed the Hamas attack on Israel on a ""deadly combination"" of Biden's ""incompetence, radicalism, and weakness.""
Trump, who faces 91 charges in a range of criminal cases as he campaigns for the nation's highest office, also accused Biden's administration of ""weaponizing"" the justice system against him. He added that Biden's efforts to do so are being enabled by his ""protectors"" in the ""fake news"" media.
The comments appeared to be a reference to claims made by Biden in Pennsylvania earlier this month in which he said that Trump intends to uproot democracy to ensure he wins the election.
""Whether democracy is still America's sacred cause is what the 2024 election is all about,"" Biden said on January 5. ""Donald Trump's campaign is all about him, not America, not you. Donald Trump's campaign is obsessed with the past, not the future. He's willing to sacrifice our democracy to put himself in power.""
Meanwhile, GOP-nomination candidate Nikki Haley, whom polling suggests trails Trump by around ten percentage points in New Hampshire, openly questioned her Republican opponent's mental fitness, following comments in recent days in which Trump appeared to mistake her for former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
""When you're dealing with the pressures of a presidency, we can't have someone else that we question whether they're mentally fit to do it,"" Haley said on Saturday.

The ministry said Sunday 25,102 have been killed in the war between Israel and Hamas while 62,681 people have been injured in the conflict.
In the past 24 hours, the ministry said that 178 Palestinians have been killed and 293 were injured.
British Defense Secretary Grant Shapps told Sky News Sunday that it is 'disappointing' to hear of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's opposition to a Palestinian state.
'Unless you pursue a two-state solution, I really don't see that there is another solution,' Shapps said.
Netanyahu said Saturday that he 'will not compromise on full Israeli control' over Gaza and stated that 'this is contrary to a Palestinian state,' rebuffing U.S. President Joe Biden's comment that creative solutions could bridge wide gaps between the leaders' views on Palestinian statehood.
Discussing his administration's position Friday, Biden said, 'There are a number of types of two-state solutions' when he was asked if a two-state solution was impossible with Netanyahu in office, Biden replied, 'No, it's not.'
Biden said Friday he spoke with Netanyahu, the first call the White House had in nearly a month with the Israeli leader, about possible solutions for creation of an independent Palestinian state, suggesting one path could involve a nonmilitarized government.
'In his conversation with President Biden, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty,' a statement from the Israeli prime minister's office said.
The Israeli prime minister is facing increasing conflicting pressures at home.
Relatives of hostages held by Hamas militants in Gaza protested outside his home Saturday, demanding his government take decisive steps to secure the release of their loved ones. They say they fear that escalating military activity further endangers the captives' lives.
Meanwhile, a divide over the direction of the war, now in its fourth month, is growing inside the Israeli cabinet.
Former Israeli army chief Gadi Eisenkot, a member of Israel's War Cabinet, has said a cease-fire is the only way to secure the hostages' release, a comment that implied criticism of Israel's current strategy not to let up on Israel's war on Hamas militants until their destruction.
Netanyahu also is under heat by members of his right-wing governing coalition who want an all-out war against Hamas, while the U.S., Israel's main ally, is calling for restraint in Gaza.
The Israeli leader has said he will push for 'complete victory' against Hamas but has not outlined how he would achieve it.
Critics have accused him of preventing a Cabinet-level debate about a post-war scenario for Gaza. They say Netanyahu is stalling to prevent conflict within his coalition.
A protester - who wears a shirt bearing an image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - stands at a Tel Aviv, Israel, demonstration demanding the release of the hostages kidnapped on October 7 by Hamas militants, Jan. 20, 2024.
A strike on a residential building in Damascus, Syria, Saturday killed five members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran said, blaming Israel.
Hours later, the IRGC issued statements identifying the five dead as Hojjatollah Omidvar, Ali Aghazadeh, Hossein Mohammadi, Saeed Karimi and Mohammad Amin Samadi.
Iran has vowed to carry out revenge attacks against Israel.
Syrian state television said the building, which was destroyed in the midmorning strike, was in a neighborhood of the Syrian capital where several embassies are located.
There was no immediate comment from Israel, which rarely acknowledges its actions in Syria.
Rescuers gather in front of a building destroyed in a reported Israeli strike in Damascus, Syria, on Jan. 20, 2024.
The strike came as Israel hit targets across Gaza Saturday.
Israel said it targeted militants in northern Gaza who it said were trying to plant explosives and fire missiles at Israeli tanks.
In Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, witnesses reported intense shelling overnight near Nasser Hospital. Israel said its troops raided a militant compound where it found explosives and destroyed rocket launchers.
Israel vowed to destroy Hamas, which governs Gaza, after the militant group sent fighters rampaging into Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israel. Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and others, also took about 240 people as hostages.
The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry reported one of the largest single-day death tolls, including 165 Palestinians killed and 280 more wounded in the last 24 hours.
The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but most of the nearly 25,000 Palestinians killed since the war began are civilians, health officials say.
The unrelenting humanitarian crisis in Gaza 'remains dire,' the Red Crescent said Saturday on X, formerly Twitter, 'with 800,000 Palestinians grappling with a severe scarcity of essential supplies.'
Women hit hard during war
Women have been particularly hard-hit in the Gaza crisis. Seventy percent of the nearly 25,000 people killed in Gaza have been women and children, a figure that includes two mothers per hour, according to a report issued Friday by U.N. Women, the U.N. agency for gender equality and empowerment for women and girls.
'We have seen evidenced once more that women and children are the first victims of conflict and that our duty to seek peace is a duty to them,' Sima Bahous, executive director of U.N. Women, said Friday in a statement accompanying the report.

Israel arrested 22 Palestinians overnight in the occupied West Bank, including a woman and children, according to Al Jazeera. The arrests were conducted in Hebron, Nablus, Tubas, Bethlehem, Jenin and Jerusalem, it said.
The Palestinian Prisoners Club told Al Jazeera the arrests ""were accompanied by widespread raids and abuse, in addition to widespread sabotage and destruction of citizens' homes, the destruction of infrastructure, and the confiscation of money and vehicles.""

Ukraine and its backers kept accusing Russia of undermining nuclear safety, even as Kiev's top military spy Kirill Budanov admitted to at least three botched Ukrainian assaults to retake ZNPP.
None of Kiev's commando operations managed to establish a Ukrainian foothold in the nuclear city of Energodar, located in the Zaporozhye region, which joined Russia following a referendum in 2022. However, Ukrainian officials claimed the expeditions gave them valuable experience and contributed to a larger goal of preventing Russia from using the plant to provide electricity to the region. The Zaporozhye station is in a state of partial shutdown, with a single reactor providing power for its own consumption.
Ulyanov noted that according to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM) it was up to the national authorities to determine and introduce ""other appropriate measures necessary for the physical protection of nuclear facilities."" Even the IAEA chief Rafael Grossi himself admitted last June that ""while the presence of any explosive device is not in line with safety standards, the main safety functions of the facility would not be significantly affected.""
The IAEA was fully aware about the mines and its removal last November, Ulyanov said, arguing that if now they have ""reappeared"" it only means that the Russian authorities deemed it a ""necessary"" security measure.

F9PSYD35A6_YJBAIZT4ZH048DJ,"How Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is wrecking the American dream","RT.com 21st January 2024, 11:13 GMT+11","RT.com 21st January 2024, 11:13 GMT+11",20240121,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274101637/how-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-is-wrecking-the-american-dream,"Hiring by quota and diverting hours of education to 'social justice? strips US workplaces of professionals
Once a nation built on the foundation of meritocracy, where the most qualified people - regardless of race, creed or gender - rise to the top, America is now satisfied to fill positions based on quotas.
US identity politics has been coming under heavy scrutiny of late, following a highly publicized scandal involving three female presidents of leading US universities - Dr Claudine Gay of Harvard, Liz Magill of UPenn, and Dr Sally Kornbluth of MIT. The issue at hand was their refusal to say, amid the hostilities between Hamas and Israel, that calling for genocide on their campuses violated college rules and encouraged harassment.
Following their testimony before Congress, the presidents quickly fell under the laser focus of the internet and it was Harvard's Claudine Gay, the first non-white person to serve as president of the private university, who attracted the most criticism. And not without cause. It was discovered that Gay had plagiarized dozens of passages in her dissertation work, a serious offense that put the spotlight on DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) hires and on whether Gay had been awarded her lofty position not due to her academic credentials but rather due to the color of her skin, and to her sex.
Only weeks after a lengthy debate on whether Gay was qualified to preside over America's most prestigious university did she tender her resignation - although returning to her position as a member of the faculty while keeping her whopping $900,000 yearly salary.
This is certainly not an isolated case of DEI thrusting questionable candidates into top jobs, especially as many states now legally mandate the controversial policy. One need only consider the second most powerful position in the US government, the vice presidency, to see where America is heading in a handbasket. It's not an inside secret that Kamala Harris was a diversity hire; Joe Biden admitted as much on the campaign trail. ""If I'm elected president, my Cabinet, my administration will look like the country, and I commit that I will, in fact, appoint a, pick a woman to be vice president."" Later, Biden was even more specific: ""Preferably it will be someone who was of color and/or a different gender,"" he said.
Now let it sink in: Biden chose a woman of color who was polling at 1% during the Democratic race to challenge Donald Trump in 2020. Certainly, there were other potential candidates with better qualifications he could have chosen.
As it became known what a total disaster Harris has been in her position of power, just one step away from the Oval Office, she brushed aside the mounting criticism as merely the result of snipy reporting and systemic racism. She told her dwindling supporters that ""the news coverage of her would be different if she were any of her 48 predecessors, whom she has described as all white and male,"" the New York Times reported. Yet, considering how liberal the media in the US is, clearly the negative attitude towards Harris is even worse than she realizes.
Who else has been granted a golden elevator ride to the top based on DEI? Look no further than Rachel Levine, the deputy health secretary, who is a transgender woman. While Levine may be qualified to fulfill her duties - after all, she was named as one of USA Today's women of the year in 2022 - how many other equally (or superior) candidates were overlooked simply because they didn't check the critical boxes?
Or how about Pete Buttigieg, who is currently serving as the 19th US Secretary of Transportation. Formerly the mayor of South Bend, Indiana (population 103,453), Buttigieg, 42, who came out as gay in 2015, was lifted out of relative obscurity when he ran as a candidate for president in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. In the dog-eat-dog world of US power politics, such an astonishing rise to the top is almost unheard of, and only so much can be attributed to Buttigieg's intelligence and articulation to explain such a leap over dozens of other more qualified contenders. How much of Buttigieg's overnight success was based largely on his sexual orientation will never be known, but suffice it to say that Democrats were actually fretting at one point that the former mayor ""was not gay enough"" for their liking.
Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration, overseen by Buttigieg's Transportation Department that just unveiled its new 'Diversity and Inclusion' program to hire people with ""severe intellectual disability"" and ""psychiatric disability"" just days after an in-air disaster nearly occurred when a door blew off a Boeing 737 Max, causing more scrutiny about the rush to inclusivity.
""Targeted disabilities are those disabilities that the Federal government, as a matter of policy, has identified for special emphasis in recruitment and hiring,"" the FAA's website read. ""They include hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability, and dwarfism.""
The FAA doesn't specify what range of positions these diversity hires will fill, only implying in a reply to Fox News that, like any other employees, they ""must meet rigorous qualifications that of course will vary by position."" Still, critics of the move are worried that emphasis on DEI policies could make flying less safe. These include Elon Musk, who tweeted ""Do you want to fly in an airplane where they prioritized DEI hiring over your safety?""
The failure of the woke radicals to read the room, however, was never more conspicuous than when the advertisers at Anheuser-Busch chose the transgender social-media influencer Dylan Mulvaney to sing the praises of Bud Light, thus wiping out a huge segment of its working-class, beer-consuming contingency. Mulvaney was clearly not the right 'man' for the job.
Or consider the detrimental effect that DEI policies are having in the field of medicine, where medical students, instead of spending as much time as possible learning their demanding trade, are being forced to learn about previously unknown topics, like ""implicit bias"" and ""White privilege."" This is yet another way that DEI is helping to downgrade the workplace.
""There is a finite amount of time in residency training to mold a competent surgeon from a fumble-fingered intern,"" Dr Richard Bosshardt wrote in a recent article for the National Review. ""To assume that we can continue to turn out excellent surgeons and simultaneously burden surgical education with the degree of time-consuming indoctrination in anti-racism and DEI demanded by the ACS tool kit is, at best, foolish and futile, and, at worst, dangerous to our patients.""
A person may be absolutely qualified for any job regardless of their race, gender or sexual orientation. However, what is happening in the US is that many people who are lacking in the necessary qualifications are getting an unjustified career boost because their lifestyle(s) check one or more of the required boxes. Or they are being unnecessarily compelled to learn the new mantra of wokeness instead of concentrating on the basics of their field. Either way, the US campus and workplace is slow to understand that instead of working to eliminate discrimination, DEI policies are now the primary cause of it. Reducing the pool of applicants for jobs is not only a gross insult to the 'American way' but also promises to strip the workplace of its professionalism. Americans need better.

Discussing his administration's position Friday, Biden said, 'There are a number of types of two-state solutions' when he was asked if a two-state solution was impossible with Netanyahu in office, Biden replied, 'No, it's not.'
Biden said Friday he spoke with Netanyahu, the first call the White House had in nearly a month with the Israeli leader, about possible solutions for creation of an independent Palestinian state, suggesting one path could involve a nonmilitarized government.
'In his conversation with President Biden, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty,' a statement from the Israeli prime minister's office said.
The Israeli prime minister is facing increasing conflicting pressures at home.
Relatives of hostages held by Hamas militants in Gaza protested outside his home Saturday, demanding his government take decisive steps to secure the release of their loved ones. They say they fear that escalating military activity further endangers the captives' lives.
Meanwhile, a divide over the direction of the war, now in its fourth month, is growing inside the Israeli cabinet.
Former Israeli army chief Gadi Eisenkot, a member of Israel's War Cabinet, has said a cease-fire is the only way to secure the hostages' release, a comment that implied criticism of Israel's current strategy not to let up on Israel's war on Hamas militants until their destruction.
Netanyahu also is under heat by members of his right-wing governing coalition who want an all-out war against Hamas, while the U.S., Israel's main ally, is calling for restraint in Gaza.
The Israeli leader has said he will push for 'complete victory' against Hamas but has not outlined how he would achieve it.
Critics have accused him of preventing a Cabinet-level debate about a post-war scenario for Gaza. They say Netanyahu is stalling to prevent conflict within his coalition.
A protester - who wears a shirt bearing an image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - stands at a Tel Aviv, Israel, demonstration demanding the release of the hostages kidnapped on October 7 by Hamas militants, Jan. 20, 2024.
A strike on a residential building in Damascus, Syria, Saturday killed five members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran said, blaming Israel.
Hours later, the IRGC issued statements identifying the five dead as Hojjatollah Omidvar, Ali Aghazadeh, Hossein Mohammadi, Saeed Karimi and Mohammad Amin Samadi.
Iran has vowed to carry out revenge attacks against Israel.
Syrian state television said the building, which was destroyed in the midmorning strike, was in a neighborhood of the Syrian capital where several embassies are located.
There was no immediate comment from Israel, which rarely acknowledges its actions in Syria.
Rescuers gather in front of a building destroyed in a reported Israeli strike in Damascus, Syria, on Jan. 20, 2024.
The strike came as Israel hit targets across Gaza Saturday.
Israel said it targeted militants in northern Gaza who it said were trying to plant explosives and fire missiles at Israeli tanks.
In Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, witnesses reported intense shelling overnight near Nasser Hospital. Israel said its troops raided a militant compound where it found explosives and destroyed rocket launchers.
Israel vowed to destroy Hamas, which governs Gaza, after the militant group sent fighters rampaging into Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israel. Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and others, also took about 240 people as hostages.
The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry reported one of the largest single-day death tolls, including 165 Palestinians killed and 280 more wounded in the last 24 hours.
The ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but most of the nearly 25,000 Palestinians killed since the war began are civilians, health officials say.
The unrelenting humanitarian crisis in Gaza 'remains dire,' the Red Crescent said Saturday on X, formerly Twitter, 'with 800,000 Palestinians grappling with a severe scarcity of essential supplies.'
Women hit hard during war
Women have been particularly hard-hit in the Gaza crisis. Seventy percent of the nearly 25,000 people killed in Gaza have been women and children, a figure that includes two mothers per hour, according to a report issued Friday by U.N. Women, the U.N. agency for gender equality and empowerment for women and girls.
'We have seen evidenced once more that women and children are the first victims of conflict and that our duty to seek peace is a duty to them,' Sima Bahous, executive director of U.N. Women, said Friday in a statement accompanying the report.

Israel arrested 22 Palestinians overnight in the occupied West Bank, including a woman and children, according to Al Jazeera. The arrests were conducted in Hebron, Nablus, Tubas, Bethlehem, Jenin and Jerusalem, it said.
The Palestinian Prisoners Club told Al Jazeera the arrests ""were accompanied by widespread raids and abuse, in addition to widespread sabotage and destruction of citizens' homes, the destruction of infrastructure, and the confiscation of money and vehicles.""

Sramek, who heads the city-building project, offered the first details about his proposal to construct at least 20,000 homes in rural Solano County, located between Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area.
To bypass protections adopted in 1984 to keep agricultural land from being turned into urban areas, Sramek's plan, which would be built on more than US$800 million of rural land that he and his company, California Forever, secretly purchased over many years, must be approved by county voters in November.
The development could be ""an amazing success story"" in a state in need of a win at a time when leaders of Texas and Florida are routinely beating up California, something that was unimaginable 50 years ago when all anyone could talk about was the ""California Dream,"" Sramek said.
The project's proponents said that Solano County is the ideal place to build, and the location near Travis Air Force Base would appeal to military contractors.
However, as Sramek's company spent years secretly buying up land around the base and even suing local farmers who refused to sell, the project's critics, including local politicians and environmental groups, such as the Sierra Club, have expressed skepticism about its aims.
In a statement released by Solano Together, a coalition that opposes the initiative, the Solano Farm Bureau said, ""Buying up farmland at low prices and rezoning for housing development has been a quick way to make a buck for decades in California.""
Veteran Democratic consultant Bill Carrick said, ""People are wary of the unknown.""
The proponents must ""make Solano County voters believe this is better for them than the current status quo. People are suspicious about ballot measures, otherwise, more of them would pass,"" he added.
He decided to build from scratch because the needs are too great to build within existing cities, Sramek said, adding construction costs are too high to make affordable housing work, and there is not enough land to meet the demand for jobs and homes."

The blast occurred at 3:38 a.m. local time (1938 GMT on Friday) in the workshop of a metal product factory in Changzhou city, 180 kilometers (111 miles) northwest of Shanghai, according to the official Xinhua news agency.
'A dust explosion occurred in the production workshop of Shenrong Metal Technology Limited, killing eight people and lightly injuring eight others,' Xinhua said.
A dust explosion occurs when flammable particles - including metals - in the air unexpectedly ignite.
An investigation into the blast is under currently way, Xinhua reported.
Deadly industrial accidents are common in China, where safety regulations are often poorly enforced or ignored.
In May last year, nine people died in a blast at a factory used to produce hydrogen peroxide in Liaocheng, a city in China's eastern Shandong province.
And in November 2022, more than 20 people were killed at a factory in central China's Henan province, with authorities blaming workers there of being engaged in illegal welding."

""BJP-RSS are spreading hatred and violence in society by making one religion fight against another, one caste against another and one language against another, so that they can distract you. They aim to snatch your wealth and keep it with them,"" the Congress MP said.
Rahul Gandhi resumed the second leg of his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Assam by re-entering the state from the Rajgarh-Hollongi (Assam-Arunachal Pradesh) border on Sunday, the eighth day of his journey.
Highlighting issues of unemployment and farmers not getting right prices for their crops, Rahul Gandhi said, ""We met lakhs of people in 'Bharat Jodo Yatra'. The youth raised issues of unemployment and farmers told us about not getting right prices for their crops. Now to hear your voice once again, we have started the 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra'.""""The youths here spend lakhs of rupees to go to school and college, but then come to know that they cannot get employment in Assam.

Hitting out at Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Rahul Gandhi alleged, ""Who is the most corrupt Chief Minister of India? The people of Assam and the entire country know that the answer is Himanta Biswa Sarma.""""Those who are threatening us should know that this is not the journey of Rahul Gandhi, it is the journey of the people of Assam. Rahul Gandhi and the people of Assam are not afraid of the Chief Minister, they can do whatever they want,"" he added.
The Yatra re-entered Assam on Sunday after spending a night in Arunachal Pradesh. The first leg of the journey in Assam was from Thursday to Saturday afternoon, after which it crossed over to Arunachal Pradesh.
The Congress leader met with an all-party delegation over a cup of tea during the Yatra in Assam's Rajgarh.
Rahul Gandhi paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi by offering flowers on his statue during the Yatra. He also paid tributes to the statues of freedom fighters Swahid Kanaklata and Mukund Kakati.
The police stopped the convoy of Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra for some time in Assam's Biswanath district on Sunday. However, after a discussion between the police and party workers, the Yatra resumed.
Earlier on Saturday, Congress General Secretary Jairam Ramesh claimed that Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma is making all efforts to prevent the party's Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra program in Guwahati.
""On January 23, as per our schedule, we will be staying at Guwahati. We are trying our best to carry on with our Yatra as planned.

In an interview with a private news station, the former Pakistan Prime Minister stated that the PML-N has begun its election campaign and delaying elections now would be damaging to Pakistan and democracy; hence, the PML-N will reject any efforts to delay polls.
He claimed that the 13-party coalition administration rescued the country from economic default during its 16-month existence.
Shehbaz stated that if the May 9 incidents had not occurred, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder and former prime minister Imran Khan would not have been imprisoned.
Last week, PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif declared that the 'all-important' general elections on February 8 will determine Pakistan's fate, encouraging people to design the 'map of the future' after analysing the history, reported ARY News.
Sharif stated that the PML-N has already begun its election campaign, led by the party's senior leaders--Nawaz Sharif, Maryam Nawaz, and Hamza Shehbaz, ARY News reported.

In a video message on social media platform X, DeSantis said that he is ending his White House bid after an underwhelming performance in Iowa, adding that there was no clear path to presidential success for his campaign.
""If there was anything I could do to produce a favourable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it, but I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign,"" DeSantis said in the message.
He added, ""Winston Churchill once remarked that success is not final, failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts. While this campaign has ended, the mission continues down here in Florida. We will continue to show the country how to lead"".
The Florida Governor also endorsed Donald Trump, stating that despite his 'disagreements', the majority of Republican primary voters want to give him another chance.
He also said that the country can't go back to the politics being represented by his rival and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley.
""I am proud to have delivered on 100 per cent of my promises and I will not stop now. It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance...While I have had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden. That is clear,"" he said in his address.
He added, ""I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honour that pledge. He has my endorsement, because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear or repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.""Notably, DeSantis finished a distant second at the Iowa caucuses, but still fell well short of Trump, winning just 21 per cent support to that of Trump's 51 per cent. He was widely expected to fare poorly in New Hampshire, where former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley is seen as the most competitive rival to the former president, The Hill reported.
A CNN poll released on Sunday found Trump with 50 per cent support among likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire, while his closest competitor, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, stood at 39 per cent.
DeSantis stood at just 6 per cent in the poll, below the 10 per cent minimum support he would need to win delegates there per the Republican Party's rules.
The Florida governor launched his official bid in May with the support of a number of GOP campaign veterans in his campaign apparatus and super PAC.
DeSantis had been seen as the most viable Trump alternative after cruising to re-election as Florida governor during last year's midterm elections. His victory was in sharp contrast to how other Republicans performed around the country, including many who had been endorsed by Trump, as per The Hill. (ANI)"
IHX82IZ0QX_NZ6WNY87P6F22EZ,Egypt falling out of favor with Russians media,"RT.com 22nd January 2024, 05:13 GMT+11","RT.com 22nd January 2024, 05:13 GMT+11",20240121,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274102187/egypt-falling-out-of-favor-with-russians-media,"Number of bookings reportedly dropped due to the warring tensions across the Middle East
The number of bookings made by Russians for the popular Egyptian tourist destinations of Cairo and Sharm el-Sheikh in January has seen a year-on-year decline of 14%, Russian business daily Kommersant reported earlier this week, citing calculations by travel website Ostrovok.ru.
The drop in demand for holidays in the African nation, once wildly popular among Russians willing to escape snow and sub-zero temperatures, is primarily attributed to geopolitical situations across the region. Over the past six months, it has been hit by the escalation of the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as well as Houthi attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea.
Apart from the security concerns, holidays in Egypt have become more expensive, the CEO of Russian tour operator Space Travel, Artur Muradian, told media, saying the price hikes relate to a ruble exchange rate that stood at high levels throughout the year.
""Now it fluctuates at 90 rubles per dollar, and this is bad for Egypt,"" the travel expert said. ""Due to the pressing necessity to fly around various countries and Russian southern territories, the flight duration has increased to six hours,"" he pointed out, ""which means that the tickets cannot be cheap.""
In addition, the travel sector is currently experiencing a shortage of direct flights, which cannot be provided by either Egyptian or Russian airlines. This forces carriers to charge higher costs for transportation.
A confluence of these various factors has shifted a package holiday in Egypt from the budget category to the mid-range segment, raising the price of a week for two in one of the country's resorts by up to 180,000 rubles (over $2,000).
Russian travel agencies have also highlighted the growing popularity of other destinations in the Middle East, despite the unstable geopolitical situation in the region.
""The United Arab Emirates is evidently the leader, while demand for tours to Qatar, Oman and Bahrain has recently seen a notable growth,"" Dmitry Gorin, vice president of the Russian Union of Travel Industry, told Kommersant.
As per data tracked by Ostrovok, the number of foreign bookings for the summer has increased by 77% compared to bookings for summer 2023, with TÃ¼rkiye remaining the leader among the most preferred destinations. There, the average cost of a tour for two has surged 20%, topping 200,000 rubles (some $2,300). A comparable trip to Egypt costs about the same.

A fire has erupted at the export terminal of Novatek, Russia's second-largest natural gas producer, the governor of Leningrad region Alexander Drozdenko confirmed early Sunday morning.
There were no casualties reported as a result of the blaze in the commercial Baltic sea port of Ust-Luga.
Authorities have placed Kingiseppsky district on high alert and conducted the evacuation of the port terminal. Firefighters have been deployed and first responders have been dispatched to the scene, according to the district head Yuri Zapalatsky.
Although the cause of the fire remains unknown, the residents of the nearby cities said that they heard sounds of the UAVs preceding the explosion. Local newspaper Fontanka reported that around the time of the incident the St. Petersburg airport Pulkovo introduced the so-called Kovyor (carpet) mode, when aircraft departures and landings are prohibited due to external danger.
Ust-Luga is the biggest port in the Baltic Sea, located approximately 170 kilometers from St. Petersburg and 35 kilometers from the Estonian border. There are twelve terminals, designed to handle various products including oil and gas, fertilizers, LNG as well as timber, and grains.
Earlier this week, the Russian military thwarted an attempted Ukrainian drone attack over the St. Petersburg area, which according to the local media, targeted an oil terminal. A propeller-driven aircraft loaded with 3kg of explosives was shot down in the vicinity of the city's Crude Oil Loading Terminal Stock Company.
Ukraine has regularly targeted infrastructure in Russian border regions with drone and missile strikes, although attacks on targets as far away as Leningrad Region - around 1,000km from the Ukrainian border - are rarer.
On Saturday night and Sunday evening, Russian air defense systems intercepted multiple UAVs over the Smolensk and Tula regions, but authorities have yet to confirm the cause of the incident in Ust Luga.

In a statement issued here, the CM said, ""The Central Government has formed a high-level committee under the chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary to review the internal reservation for Scheduled Castes. This seems to be nothing more than a ploy to mislead the Dalit community, as it is clear that the BJP has no genuine concern behind it"".
The Justice Usha Mehra Commission, also constituted by the Central Government for the same purpose, had concluded that sub-categorization of Scheduled Castes and providing internal reservation is the only solution through a constitutional amendment, CM said.
""The National Commission for Scheduled Castes, which had studied the sub-categorization of Scheduled Castes in Andhra Pradesh, had expressed the same opinion. Then, what is the need for another high-level committee? This appears to be merely a tactic to waste time.""""If the Central Government truly intends to fulfil the demands for internal reservation for Scheduled Castes, it should present a bill to amend Section 341 of the Constitution in Parliament, get it approved, and implement the reservation quickly. No matter how many high-level committees are formed, they cannot make recommendations beyond the constitutional provisions. According to Sections 341(1) and (2) of the Constitution, any addition or removal of castes from the Scheduled Castes list requires a constitutional amendment, a simple truth known to those with basic knowledge of the Constitution,"" read the statement.

After the responsibility of fulfilling the demands for internal reservation for Scheduled Castes has fallen on their shoulders, the BJP leaders, confused and anxious, are giving random statements, exposing their ignorance.""""Former Minister Govind Karjol, a senior Dalit leader who claims to be a follower of Babasaheb Ambedkar, attempting to twist the Constitution is regrettable. The fact that he is spreading misinformation is not due to his ignorance, but because he is following the lines dictated by the RSS, which is anti-Dalit,"" as per the statement.
The CM said that former Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai has said that our government should have implemented the Sadashiva Commission report.
""He seems to have forgotten that he was the Chief Minister of the state for three and a half years. But the people of the state remember. Those who are now pressuring us--why didn't they accept and implement the Sadashiva Commission report when they were in power?

""There are ways, for example, to borrow money from residents [for military spending],"" Armonaite stated, while stressing that citizens should not expect substantial returns on any investments.
""I have heard criticism of the idea of such bonds, but there is a lot of money that people still have. Maybe it's better stop keeping it in a sock, but to invest in a tank,"" she added.
The defense ministers of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia last week signed an agreement aimed at developing a joint air defense system in the Baltic.
At the same time, Estonia announced plans to build around 600 'concrete bunkers' on the border with Russia. Fellow NATO members Latvia and Lithuania have reportedly signed up for the project as well.
Earlier this month, the commander of the Lithuanian army, General Valdemaras Rupsis, argued that the Western defense industry needs to be restored to Cold War levels in order to deal with geopolitical shifts.

""We don't have any other option than to go to Mumbai. Today is the second day of the padayatra. Nearly 15 lakh people joined the padayatra yesterday. We have to ask some of them to go back to avoid inconvenience...,"" Patil said on Sunday.
Patil said that on January 25 and 26, Mumbai will be filled with Maratha people and they will not walk back from there without reservations.
""...but one thing is sure, on January 25 evening and January 26, Mumbai will be full of Maratha people and the whole of Mumbai will become Bhagva (saffron). Our community will go in full strength. One thing is sure that we will not back from here without taking reservations at whatever cost..we will not take our step back,"" Patil said.
The Maratha leader said that they are up for discussion but the government is already aware of their demands.
""...our door was never closed for discussion...I don't have anything to say. The government knows everything already, what is our demand...,"" Patil said.
Patil said that Kunabi Certificates will be given to all Maratha community members who have proof of being a Kunbi.
""The government must immediately give Kunbi certificate to all Maratha community members whose proof of being Kunbi has been identified,"" he said.
Patil said that a march has been scheduled from Beed to Ahmednagar on the second day of his foot march.
Maratha reservation protests reignited in Maharashtra on Friday as Manoj Jarange Patil led a march to Mumbai demanding immediate implementation of the Maratha reservation.
The Supreme Court has posted for hearing on January 24 a curative petition filed by the Maharashtra government challenging its May 5, 2021 judgment, which had held the Maratha reservation law unconstitutional.
The curative petition is the last chance available to the people or parties in the case after the review petition is dismissed.
On May 5, 2021, the Supreme Court had struck down reservations for the Maratha community in colleges, higher educational institutions, and jobs, after noting that there was no valid ground to breach 50 per cent reservation while granting Maratha reservation.
Moreover, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde said that a special session will be called to discuss the Maratha reservation in February 2024 and assured that no injustice will be done to any other community while giving reservation to the Maratha community. (ANI)"

Russian export revenues dropped by almost a third in 2023, according to the preliminary assessment released by the Bank of Russia, which cites a decline in prices for crude oil as one of the key reasons for the decrease.
Last year, export revenues amounted to $422.7 billion compared to $592.1 billion in record-breaking 2022, marking a decline by at least 30%, the regulator said, adding that the figure is the lowest in four years.
At the same time, the country's imports in monetary terms totaled $304.4 billion, scoring a year-on-year growth of 10%. They returned to the levels recorded in 2021, before the launch of the military operation in Ukraine.
As a result, the trade surplus in 2023 amounted to $50.2 billion, compared to $238 billion recorded in the previous year.
According to the data tracked by the Russian Ministry of Finance, the average price of Russia's flagship Urals blend was hovering around $63 per barrel, 17% lower compared to an average of $76.1 recorded in 2022.
Earlier this week, Maksim Oreshkin, the top economic adviser to President Vladimir Putin, said that hydrocarbons remain a vital part of the country's economy and provide a significant share of budget revenue. However, he cautioned that energy exports are not promising in the long term.
In December, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said Russia's energy sector contributed ""about 27% to gross domestic product (GDP)."" He added that the proceeds from oil and gas accounted for ""nearly 57% of the total export revenue of our entire country.""
Last year, the G7 and EU nations imposed a price limit on Russian seaborne oil sales. The measure bans Western companies from providing insurance and other services to shipments of Russian crude unless the cargo is purchased at or below the $60-per-barrel price cap. Similar restrictions were introduced in February for exports of Russian petroleum products. The measures were intended to reduce Moscow's energy revenues substantially.

The Taliban-appointed security command in Kunar province said that the explosion took place in the ""Trink"" area of Chapa Dara district in Kunar province. According to officials, the incident took place when the explosion occurred in the house of a person named Noorgul.
Fareed Ahmad Dehqan, the media officer of the security command in Kunar, said three people were killed and six others were still undergoing treatment for their injuries.
Taliban-appointed officials said all the dead were members of the same family. According to the Taliban-appointed Kunar province officials, the nature of the explosion and how it occurred is still unclear. However, a probe is being conducted into the matter, Khaama press reported.
Unexploded ordnance from wars that took place in the past continues to detonate in various parts of Afghanistan, claiming the lives of people.
This comes at a time when the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that Afghanistan is one of the most mine and explosive-contaminated nations. According to OCHA, two-thirds of the 401 districts in Afghanistan have been contaminated with explosive remnants.
On January 11, two people were killed and 12 others were injured after an explosion in Kabul, Khaama Press reported citing officials.
Taliban-appointed Kabul security department spokesperson Khalid Zadran said the explosion was due to a grenade blast that occurred in Kabul's PD 18. He said that an investigation is being carried out to find the perpetrator.
In a separate incident, another explosion was reported in northern Mazar-e-Sharif. Authorities have not shared any information regarding potential casualties, Khaama Press reported. (ANI)"

Russia is not surprised that Germany has decided to defend Israel in a genocide case in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), as unconditional support for the Jewish state is obligatory in Washington's 'rules-based international order,' Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has said.
In late December, South Africa brought proceedings against Israel at the ICJ, alleging it had breached the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in its aerial and ground bombardment of Gaza in response to the Hamas cross-border attack on October 7.
It also asked the court in The Hague to order Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza.""
Berlin has disputed the genocide charge. On January 5, a spokesperson for Germany's Federal Foreign Office said that Israel's ""targeted action against armed attackers; that is, fighters in an armed conflict, is not action with the intention of destroying an ethnic group.""
""We have made it very clear that, in our opinion, the claim that Israel is committing genocide in the Gaza Strip is false and not covered by the Convention,"" the official added.
More than 25,000 people have so far been killed in Israel's offensive, Palestinian health officials say, while about 1,200 people died in the Hamas attack last October. Another 240 were seized as hostages.
Last Friday, Germany announced that it would intervene on behalf of Israel as a third party in the case - effectively telling the ICJ that it objects to the interpretation of the genocide convention, and how it is being applied to Israel.
This development is not surprising, Zakharova said on Sunday, telling the media that it ""comes against the backdrop of the unconditional support that Berlin always provides Israel, regardless of consequences.""
""This line of the German authorities has long and firmly occupied an important place among the unspoken dogmas of the 'rules-based order' defined by Washington,"" she added.

This was suggested at the first session of the Sub-Committee on Fisheries Management under the Committee on Fisheries (COFI) of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO).
India's statement on climate-resilient fishing was presented to the global body by the ICAR-Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), Kochi. The Indian delegation was led by J Balaji, former Joint Secretary, Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Government of India.
Carbon emissions per kg of fish caught in India's marine fisheries are 17.7 per cent less than the global average according to a recent study, said India.
It maintained that, in terms of climate change, India falls into the medium-to-high category considering the overall impact by 2050. J Jayasankar, Head of Fishery Resources Assessment, Economics and Extension Division of CMFRI, read out the statement, highlighting India's proactive stance on tackling the climate crisis in the fisheries sector.
The meeting, held virtually from FAO, Rome, was attended by members of the FAO Committee on Fisheries (COFI) plus one member organisation, representatives from three specialised agencies of the United Nations, observers from other FAO member nations and observers from intergovernmental and international non-governmental organisations.
Apart from CMFRI, officials from the Department of Fisheries, Govt of India and the Fishery Survey of India were also part of the Indian delegation. Dr Balaji was elected as the First Vice-Chairperson of the incoming Bureau of the Sub-Committee, which serves as a forum for consultation and discussion on fisheries management, associated technical and policy issues, and the related work performed by FAO.
""A big step towards climate-resilient fisheries is harnessing the carbon sequestration potential of seaweeds to mitigate climate change impacts. Enhancing natural habitats for improving seaweed resources, expanding seaweed culture systems and enhancing mangrove ecosystems may help lay the path for better carbon sequestration,"" India's statement said.
The country urged global and regional bodies to integrate the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) prediction with macro-indicators such as habitat upheaval, resource stress and market orientation.
This integration, India suggests, would enable member nations to incorporate insights into regulations, adaptations and integrated managerial strategies on a dynamic basis.
The statement further said: ""India suggests that FAO may plan to schedule capacity-building exercises in mitigating emissions of greenhouse gases in capture fisheries and aquaculture; spatial planning; cross-sectoral planning; adaptive fisheries management; strengthening resilience; safety at sea; rehabilitating ecosystems; and stronger farming structures. India also requests member countries to share the best, scalable, and reproducible solutions and suggests that FAO may chronicle them for the common benefit of the community of nations.""CMFRI also presented India's statement on Mainstreaming Biodiversity in Marine Fisheries Management at the meeting. This demanded the interlinking of reports on habitat mapping and valuation, fishery and assessment of both the stocks of targeted resources as well as those like marine mammals and migratory species to develop regional indicators. Shoba Joe Kizhakudan, Head of the Finfish Fisheries Division of CMFRI, read out this statement at the meeting.
It pointed out that promoting more marine protected areas (MPAs) to match the requirements of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and initiatives like artificial reefs at suitable locations along the coastal stretch of the country add to India's efforts to bring biodiversity to centre stage by keeping the livelihoods of traditional fishermen unaffected.
India informed the gathering that fishermen in the country are well aware of the role of biodiversity, as is quite evident from the increasing reports of the rescue of entangled marine mammals and sea turtles.
""Considering the goals of the Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), India recognises that the key indicators of interest would be metrics like health indices of ecosystems and the proportion of MPAs.
India welcomes and supports FAO initiatives to provide guidance on mainstreaming biodiversity in fisheries management across regions and actions to reduce threats to biodiversity. India also encourages FAO to act on the fourth goal of the GBF viz funding gap, for multilateral unified actions across regions with a focus on halting and reversing biodiversity loss while respecting the interests of the fisheries sectors,"" the statement said.
""Indian authorities are also reaching out to stakeholders in a big way to inform the importance of compliance with international conservation instruments like CITES. The country's own Wildlife Protection Act serves as the main binding legal instrument that ensures conservation of biodiversity,"" India's statement said. (ANI)"

The Congress has often taken pot shots at the BJP with the 'Mandir wahi baneyenge par tareek nahin batayenge (they will raise a temple but wouldn't set a date for it) barb.
Under the leadership of Prime Minuister Modi, the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court came out with a landmark ruling, settling the age-old Ram Janmabhoomi title suit in favour of the Hindu side.
Speaking to ANI on Sunday, the Congress leader also acknowledged the 'sacrifices' of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal members to take the Ram Temple Movement to a logical conclusion.
""The temple was raised after the country's highest court settled the title dispute once and for all. After a long battle and a landmark ruling of the Supreme Court, giving primacy to the findings of the archaeological survey, Lord Ram will return to his birthplace tomorrow. Had it not been for PM Modi, this temple would never have been built. This is why I wish to give the entire credit for the making of the Ram Mandir and the 'Pran Pratishtha' of Ram Lalla to PM Modi. Many governments were elected and several PMs came and went but none showed the political will to end the 500-year wait for the Ram Temple. Members of the VHP and Bajrang Dal, too, made plenty of sacrifices but this temple would never have been a reality, if Modi wasn't PM,"" the Congress leader said.
Also praising Prime Minister Modi for his 11-day Anushthan, during which he has embraced certain rigorous religious practices and is keeping a fast while visiting shrines and sites associated with Lord Ram across the country, Acharya Krishnam said, ""From Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehrum till today, the country has seen many PMs. But none made such a big effort to fulfil a long-held demand or wish. I commend the prime minister for this work.""Taking a dig at Opposition leaders for turning down invitations to the 'Pran Pratishtha' ceremony in Ayodhya, the Congress leader said it was 'unfortunate', as declining an opportunity to be part of an event featuring Lord Ram was akin to insulting Indian culture.
""I see it as a matter of grave misfortune. No follower of the Christian faith or a priest, or a Muslim preacher can ever turn down an invitation from Lord Ram. The deity resides in our soul and transcends faith. The country cannot be imagined without Him. Rejecting Prabhu Ram's invitation means insulting Indian culture. It is akin to casting aspersions on the country's identity and civilisational ethos. This is why Mahatma Gandhi dreamt of a 'Ram Rajya' and the Congress, which is a party that espouses his ideals, cannot be anti-Ram. Therefore, I would urge all Opposition parties to unite against the BJP but not against Lord Ram and Sanatan,"" he said.
Defending his visit to Ayodhya for the 'Pran Pratishtha' on Monday, the senior Congress leader said he considered himself fortunate to have received an invitation to the event.
""I consider myself to be fortunate to have received an invitation to the 'Pran Pratishtha' of Lord Ram. Looking at how Ayodhya has transformed, I feel priviliged to be here. It must be the result of some good deeds in my previous life. The difference between the Ayodhya of today and the one of yore is the same as between darkness and light,"" he added. (ANI)"

The situation on the front lines is becoming increasingly disadvantageous for Ukraine, a Kiev-based correspondent with Germany's daily Die Welt reported this week. The Ukrainian troops severely lack ammunition and personnel to fend off Russian attacks, Paul Ronzheimer said, citing ""generals and soldiers"" whom he's ""constantly been in contact with.""
Kiev's troops have largely gone on the defensive following the failure of their much-hyped summer counteroffensive. The operation, which started in early June 2023, failed to enable Ukraine to gain much ground or bring about significant changes to the front lines, despite heavy losses of personnel and equipment.
Russia's Defense Ministry has previously put Ukraine's losses during the failed counteroffensive at 160,000. Moscow also described Kiev's total losses throughout the conflict as catastrophic, estimating among its military losses nearly 400,000 soldiers killed or wounded since February 2022.
Late last year, Kiev intensified its mobilization efforts in a bid to replenish the troop pool. President Vladimir Zelensky stated earlier that the military wanted up to 500,000 new recruits.
According to Ronzheimer, ""mobilization isn't working."" Ukraine has also been flooded with reports about difficult situations at the front lines, the reporter said, without mentioning any particular news pieces. Kiev's forces were also about to run out of ammunition for its Western-made air defense systems, like America's Patriot, he said, calling such a development a ""major concern"" for the local population.
Ukrainian ""generals and ...soldiers"" also told the correspondent that the frontline situation ""is extremely tense,"" particularly near the Donbass city of Avdeevka, a strategic location north of Donetsk that's seen heavy fighting over the past months.
The Ukrainian generals want ""more mobilization"" efforts, Ronzheimer said, adding that they want to ""send more soldiers"" into the fray.
In another report earlier this week, the correspondent said that Ukrainian troops had taken to the defensive along the entire front line in the East and the South, and were still struggling to hold ground. Moscow's troops launched ""massive attacks"" in 80 areas ""along several hundred kilometers of the front,"" he added.
""We keep hearing the messages from the soldiers, which become more dramatic,"" Ronzheimer said, adding that Kiev's troops had warned they would hardly be able to defend their current positions with whatever they had in stock as of that moment.
The German journalist also said that it would be ""very difficult"" for the Ukrainian troops to particularly hold Avdeevka in the long term, since Moscow's forces were making steady progress in that area. ""The Russians are on the offensive there and are making progress meter by meter,"" Ronzheimer said, claiming that such advances were still quite costly for Moscow.

Speaking at the valedictory of the 'Udyama Vokkaliga' in Palace Ground here on Sunday, he said at one time those who owned land ruled the world. To conquer land, kings and rulers waged wars.
The greatest fighter, Alexandar, waged several wars to conquer the world, and his mentor, Aristotle had told him that a win over India was like winning the world. Subsequently, traders ruled the world. Now, the world is ruled by those who possess knowledge.
Bommai said a survey was done when the competition raged between Bill Clinton and Bill Gates over the popularity and Bill Gates emerged victorious. Agriculture is also a field and life was impossible without agriculture. One per cent growth in agriculture means the trade sector would grow by 4 per cent and the service sector by 10 per cent.
The base of all these sectors has been the field of agriculture. Unfortunately, agriculture has not progressed as an industry as the land had remained the same but the production had increased. Likewise, the income of farmers has not increased.
The Vokkaliga community would not progress if they depended only on agriculture. Along with farming, they must be involved in trade and commercial activities to open up themselves to the outer world. However, they must follow a definite plan to protect their land.
The former CM said there had been an increase in the number of Vokkaligas who sold the land to contest the election. Their trade required skill development for which self-esteem was very important. Some communities were fully dependent on money but they believed in hard work.
If they possess the knowledge, the capital will come behind them. The community must take up the challenge to achieve anything and the capital would come in search of them. It would not be possible to do anything if they feel contended.
The achievement was possible only if the bellies were empty. The vokkaligas must make a mark in trade and business also. Culture plays an important role even in trade also and the society would respect if they tread on the right path.
He said none can surpass the vokkaligas who shed the sweat in agriculture and produce. ""I have lots of respect and love for the Vokkaliga community. The BJP leader, Dr Ashwath Narayana played a pivotal role in installing the statue of Nada Prabhu Kempe Gowda near the Bengaluru International Airport.
The world will turn towards you if they mind. I have confidence in the vokkaliga youths as you have seen the world. Sri Kempe Gowda built Bengaluru and the future Bengaluru must be constructed by the sons of Kempe Gowda. (ANI)"

ANGLICANS WERE shocked and excited in mid-November - either that or shocked and appalled - when the Church of England's governing body narrowly voted to approve church services to bless same-sex civil unions. The church will continue, however, to reserve the term ""marriage"" for unions between one man and one woman.
The global Anglican community comprises about 85 million adherents in 165 countries. So this is a significant breakthrough within Christendom.
This immediately followed the conservative Orthodox Jewish community in the USA appointing an openly gay man as a rabbi for the first time ever.
And in a development which might make even hardened atheists ponder whether some guiding hand was at work, the head of the vast Roman Catholic church, Pope Francis, announced in mid-December that Catholic priests can now bless same-sex couples also.
Pope Francis kicks open the church door to gay couples - at last The head of the global Catholic Church has effectively approved same-sex unions.The wording of the Vatican decision - in a Declaration titled 'Fiducia Supplicans On the Pastoral Meaning of Blessings' - was careful. The church is not consecrating, or even approving, the union itself. It is just a blessing to the two people involved.The declaration does not oblige bishops to provide such blessings, but shows how to proceed if people request them.This apparently satisfies the rigid text of the Catholic catechism, which still describes gay and bi orientations as ""intrinsically disordered"", but offers LGBTQ couples a celebration in church, which straight couples have always received.These developments bring the three conservative religious communities more into line with the majority of Protestant churches and progressive Jewish communities which have welcomed same-sex couples for some time.The backlashInevitably, reactions have ranged from joy and jubilation to approving nods signalling ""about time!"" to outright condemnation as heresy and apostasy, which are very bad words inside churches and synagogues.Conservative Anglican Andrea Williams said:The Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby attempted reassurance:The Catholic backlash has been ferocious, with bishops in Africa and beyond declaring they will simply ignore the new Vatican policy.

The head of the global Catholic Church has effectively approved same-sex unions.
The wording of the Vatican decision - in a Declaration titled 'Fiducia Supplicans On the Pastoral Meaning of Blessings' - was careful. The church is not consecrating, or even approving, the union itself. It is just a blessing to the two people involved.

These developments bring the three conservative religious communities more into line with the majority of Protestant churches and progressive Jewish communities which have welcomed same-sex couples for some time.
The backlash
Inevitably, reactions have ranged from joy and jubilation to approving nods signalling ""about time!"" to outright condemnation as heresy and apostasy, which are very bad words inside churches and synagogues.

Poland's last government led by the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party was embroiled in a dispute with the European Union over Warsaw's judicial reforms and the rule of law, resulting in billions of EU funds for Poland being frozen.
The new pro-EU government has pledged to regain access to the money by restoring the rule of law, but it faces resistance from supporters and allies of the former ruling party, including Duda and some high-profile judges.
'I have no doubts what the point was of blocking the money from the National Recovery Plan by the European Commission. It was a purely political action against the previous Polish authorities,' Duda said during a press conference in Vilnius.
'An attempt to force Poland to change its authorities, and that's how I perceived it, that's how I perceive it, and the current events only confirm it,' he added.
A European Commision spokesperson said that there was work to be done with Poland so that all the milestones under the Recovery and Resilience Facility are satisfied.
'The Polish government has expressed its readiness to work with the Commission to fully address the milestones on judicial independence,' the spokesperson said in a response to Reuters' request for a comment.
Duda also said he was open to negotiations and proposals for various changes in the Polish justice system, but he would not allow any verification of judges who were appointed during his term.
The Oct. 15 election ended eight years of PiS rule and a new government led by former European Council president Donald Tusk has vowed to regain access to the EU funds.
In December, the European Commission said it would transfer 5 billion euros ($5.45 billion) to Warsaw from Poland's 60 billion-euro share of the bloc's COVID-19 recovery stimulus.
On Saturday, Polish Funds and Regional Policy Minister Katarzyna Pelczynska-Nalecz told private television TVN24 that Poland has met conditions to submit documents crucial for getting access to the EU's Structural Funds.

ED initiated an investigation on the basis of an FIR registered by the CBI against Bedanshu Shekhar Mishra and others relating to bank fraud and misappropriation of funds.
The action of the federal agency came after a case was filed under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against the bank official. ED said that they attached immovable property and fixed deposits worth Rs 2.56 crore to the accused bank employee.
ED investigation revealed that the main accused, Bedanshu Shekhar Mishra, while being posted as officer during 2021 and 2022, in the branch office of Punjab and Sind Bank of Khalsa College, North Campus, Delhi University, has reportedly misused his official position and carried out fraudulent transactions by using system ID's of himself and other staff members unauthorizedly to break the FDs of several customers, including SGTB Khalsa College of Delhi University, without their knowledge, and committed fraud and forgery with the bank as well as with those account holders of the bank, and misappropriated and siphoned public money to the tune of Rs 52,99,53,698.

""Tomorrow, Rahul Gandhi wants to visit Batadrava Than. There should not be any competition between Ram Temple and Batadrava. I want to appeal to Rahul Gandhi to visit Batadrava Than after the completion of the Pran Pratishtha ceremony at Ram Temple and we will also be happy with this.

The Assam Chief Minister also said that, so far there is no crowd (in the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra), there is only a curfew.
""I also want that, there should be a crowd in Rahul Gandhi's Nyay Yatra. After crossing Guwahati, even I will also appeal to the Miyas to join the yatra and there will be a crowd in Lower Assam. But so far there is no crowd in this yatra, somewhere 500, somewhere 1000. But, the Miya Muslim women will not join the yatra. I can't bar anyone from visiting the temple in Satra. But I request that double window won't look good. Batadrava Satra has not invited him, he has not been invited. There is no competition. I appeal to him to visit Batadrava Than after 2 pm.

""So they should have avoided it. But I will not ask them to avoid it officially because then they will create a tamasha (Drama) that I am trying to stop it. So police will be deployed. We will ensure that there is no conflict or clashes. Because a special section of people have come out in their yatra. It is not a secular meeting.

Muhammad Amir Rana, writing in an editorial in Dawn, highlighted the case of Sarfraz Shah, shot by paramilitary forces in 2011 and another case of Rao Anwar, a police officer accused of killing over 400 people in fake encounters, who was acquitted in the high-profile Naqibullah murder case.
Reports of law enforcement agencies indiscriminately killing innocent civilians continue across Pakistan, revealing an entrenched culture of violence enabled by flawed political, social, and justice systems, according to Dawn.
This denial marked a crucial step in rebuilding citizens' trust in the justice system. Similar incidents, such as the 2020 arrest of a Frontier Corps soldier for the killing of a university student in Turbat, is another example of the struggle for justice for a common Pakistani, the report added.
The subsequent awarding of the Sitara-i-Shujaat to a police officer implicated in the Sahiwal tragedy added to the irony. These cases shed light on power dynamics, illustrating how officials in law-enforcement agencies misuse their authority, both high-ranking and low-ranking, and how the system often shields them from accountability.
Sarfraz Shah's case stands out as a rare example of justice served, propelled by a captured incident on camera where Rangers killed a 22-year-old man in a public park in Karachi.
The emergence of social media activism and vigilant citizenry played a pivotal role in securing justice for the victim's family, showcasing the potential of civil society in demanding accountability, as reported by Dawn.
In contrast, the Naqibullah murder case's outcome, where Rao Anwar was acquitted, underscored the challenges in addressing extrajudicial practices. The Sahiwal tragedy, where the Counter Terrorism Department mistakenly killed a family, resulting in all accused officials being acquitted, further exposed the flaws in the system.
The judicial systemic issues persist. The lower ranks often bear the brunt of accountability in police brutality cases, serving as scapegoats to appease public anger while maintaining impunity for higher-ranking officials.
The reluctance of state institutions to engage with families of missing persons in Balochistan, currently protesting in Islamabad, highlights the challenges. A lack of dialogue and understanding perpetuates the issue, and the state's counterproductive tactics exacerbate tensions.
The missing persons' movement, initially focused on the rule of law, has been framed as a potential threat, reminiscent of the PTM, creating a narrative that poses challenges to the status quo.
The transformation of rights movements into political forces, exemplified by the Haq Do Tehreek in Gwadar, emphasises the necessity for justice. The judiciary plays a crucial role in preventing law enforcement agencies from abusing their power in confrontational situations.
The charged atmosphere of protests demands a nuanced approach to addressing concerns, fostering dialogue instead of coercive measures, Dawn reported. (ANI)"

In this regard, a fatwa -- legal ruling by Islamic scholars -- issued by a Karachi-based seminary has resurfaced on Facebook and X platforms, suggesting voters prefer Muslim candidates over the ones belonging to minorities.
The fatwa was issued by Jamia Uloom Islamia, New Town, famously known as Jamia Binori Town, which is located near the Guru Mandir area, The News International reported.
The religious school is considered one of the most influential seminaries in the city.
Chaman Lal, a minority rights activist, shared an image of the undated decree on Facebook stating: ""A Fatwa is issued that, it is permissible to take votes from the population of more than one million minorities, but today a fatwa has been issued that it is not permissible to vote for minority candidates in the general election.""The Fatwa was released after the query: ""Is it permitted under Islamic laws to vote for a non-Muslim candidate?""The query further added that a major political party had nominated a Hindu for the general seat in the presence of a better Muslim candidate even though there were reserved seats for non-Muslims.
""The public wants to know whether voting for a non-Muslim in this situation is permissible or not from the Islamic point of view, or is there a third option?"" he said.
In response, the fatwa said: ""The vote should be given to a candidate who has the required qualifications and ability, his party manifesto must also be correct and about whom there's satisfaction that he can take better steps for the people of their constituency, religiously and secularly. And because the non-Muslim candidate does not live up to these standards; it is better to vote for a Muslim candidate"", The News International reported.
Commenting on the matter, Chaman Lal lamented: ""When the constitution has given equal rights then those people who have worked for the betterment of their area and are willing to work more for the people of Pakistan, then why shouldn't people cast their votes in favour of them even if they belong to minorities?""""The world is running after technology while Pakistan is still stuck in religious issues -- which is no doubt important but it is a personal matter. When it comes to the state then good candidates should come forward even if they belong to a minority community,"" The News International quoted him as saying. (ANI)"

The Congress has often taken pot shots at the BJP with the 'Mandir wahi baneyenge par tareek nahin batayenge (they will raise a temple but wouldn't set a date for it) barb.
Under the leadership of Prime Minuister Modi, the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court came out with a landmark ruling, settling the age-old Ram Janmabhoomi title suit in favour of the Hindu side.
Speaking to ANI on Sunday, the Congress leader also acknowledged the 'sacrifices' of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal members to take the Ram Temple Movement to a logical conclusion.
""The temple was raised after the country's highest court settled the title dispute once and for all. After a long battle and a landmark ruling of the Supreme Court, giving primacy to the findings of the archaeological survey, Lord Ram will return to his birthplace tomorrow. Had it not been for PM Modi, this temple would never have been built. This is why I wish to give the entire credit for the making of the Ram Mandir and the 'Pran Pratishtha' of Ram Lalla to PM Modi. Many governments were elected and several PMs came and went but none showed the political will to end the 500-year wait for the Ram Temple. Members of the VHP and Bajrang Dal, too, made plenty of sacrifices but this temple would never have been a reality, if Modi wasn't PM,"" the Congress leader said.
Also praising Prime Minister Modi for his 11-day Anushthan, during which he has embraced certain rigorous religious practices and is keeping a fast while visiting shrines and sites associated with Lord Ram across the country, Acharya Krishnam said, ""From Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehrum till today, the country has seen many PMs. But none made such a big effort to fulfil a long-held demand or wish. I commend the prime minister for this work.""Taking a dig at Opposition leaders for turning down invitations to the 'Pran Pratishtha' ceremony in Ayodhya, the Congress leader said it was 'unfortunate', as declining an opportunity to be part of an event featuring Lord Ram was akin to insulting Indian culture.
""I see it as a matter of grave misfortune. No follower of the Christian faith or a priest, or a Muslim preacher can ever turn down an invitation from Lord Ram. The deity resides in our soul and transcends faith. The country cannot be imagined without Him. Rejecting Prabhu Ram's invitation means insulting Indian culture. It is akin to casting aspersions on the country's identity and civilisational ethos. This is why Mahatma Gandhi dreamt of a 'Ram Rajya' and the Congress, which is a party that espouses his ideals, cannot be anti-Ram. Therefore, I would urge all Opposition parties to unite against the BJP but not against Lord Ram and Sanatan,"" he said.
Defending his visit to Ayodhya for the 'Pran Pratishtha' on Monday, the senior Congress leader said he considered himself fortunate to have received an invitation to the event.
""I consider myself to be fortunate to have received an invitation to the 'Pran Pratishtha' of Lord Ram. Looking at how Ayodhya has transformed, I feel priviliged to be here. It must be the result of some good deeds in my previous life. The difference between the Ayodhya of today and the one of yore is the same as between darkness and light,"" he added. (ANI)"

Janakpur, the home of the in-laws of Ram Lalla is gearing up its preparation to celebrate Monday with fanfare and gaiety organizing Deepawali submerging the city with decorative lights and show.
Speaking to ANI, Pramod Kumar Chaudhary, former chairman of the Shree Ram Youth Committee, said, ""Raja Ramchandra after the Banbas (exile) in Tretayuga, the pain he had to endure; it continued in Kaliyuga as well, he had to struggle for five hundred years in Ayodhya- the birth land of Lord Ram, he had to shelter under the tarpaulin, his pain indeed was the pain of all the Hindus. Our ancestors had fought and struggled hard and the end result is here with the construction of temple of Maryadapurush Lord Ram whose Pran Pratistha is scheduled for tomorrow. On this occasion, I congratulate all the Indian nationals and Janakpur also is in state of joyousness.""With less than 24 hours left for the Pran Pratistha ceremony, the holy city of Ayodhya has decked up with lights. Janaki Sena (Army), a youth group led a campaign to collect donations in the form of oil, cotton lamps, clay pots as they aim to light two hundred and fifty thousand oil-fed lamps.
Speaking to ANI, Asutosh Jha, one of the members of organizing committee, said, ""Residents of Janakpur and Mithila are extending their support providing oil, lamps, clay items along with other items of necessity which we would require to make our campaign successful. Despite the nightfall, people still have been signing themselves up for the donation of oil which ranges from one liter to the highest as per their capacity.""According to the Ram Janmabhoomi temple trust, Varanasi priest Lakshmi Kant Dixit will officiate the main rituals during the Pran Pratistha of Ram Lalla. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi will preside over the event, thousands of politicians, saints, and celebrities, have been invited to the ceremony.
The idol of Lord Ram has been placed inside the sanctum sanctorum of the temple in Ayodhya. The idol of 'Ram Lalla' is carved by Mysuru-based sculptor Arun Yogiraj. The idol is 51 inches tall and weighs 1.5 tonnes. The idol portrays Lord Ram as a five-year-old child standing on a lotus also crafted from the same stone.
From Nepal's Janakpur, the Chief Mahanth along with the Chotte Mahanth have been invited for the ceremony and have already set off for Ayodhya. Earlier, Janakpur sent offerings locally called Bhaar to Ayodhya as a part of the ritual, which included ornaments, cuisines, clothes and other daily essentials.
Janakpur, maternal home of Goddess Sita is also set to hold a slew of events on the day of Pran Pratistha. As it plans to hold Deepawali on Monday evening, artists will make ""Rangoli"" using colours as well as flowers. The collection drive to light up about 2,50,000 oil-fed lamps is underway with over 2500 litres of mustard oil already collected for Deepawali on Monday evening.
The week-long rituals for the 'Pran Pratishtha' ceremony of the Ram Lalla idol in Uttar Pradesh's Ayodhya entered their sixth day today, marking another significant step in the auspicious event on Monday. The day commenced with the daily puja of the deities, a practice central to the ongoing Pran Pratishtha rituals.
""Today's puja ritual started with the havan and the idol of Ram Lalla was kept in Madhyadhivas today. Night Jagran Adhivas will also start today itself. The worship of the old idol of Ram Lalla is also going on in the Yagyashala. The rituals of worship are being performed with various flowers procured from many places, including Chennai and Pune,"" the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra stated on Sunday.
In today's puja, Anil Mishra, along with his family, the President of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), RN Singh and others, performed the puja rituals. (ANI)"

China's Premier Li Qiang met with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar during a diplomatic visit to Ireland. The leaders wanted to strengthen relations and agreed that Irish citizens could stay in China for up to 15 days without a visa.
During the visit, Premier Li received a warm welcome from President Michael D Higgins and discussed the positive cooperation between China and Ireland. They highlighted the progress made despite differences in political systems, cultures, and geographic size.
Premier Li said that Chinese-Irish relations are a ""good example of mutually beneficial co-operation"" between the two countries.
He added, ""Over the years our results-oriented co-operation has made steady progress and produced rich fruit. Our relations have set a good example of mutually beneficial co-operation between countries that are different in political systems, cultural divisions and geographic size.""
The Chinese premier and Taoiseach Varadkar discussed various topics during their bilateral meeting, including climate change, and the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and enjoyed a working lunch featuring Irish beef. This marks the resumption of Irish beef exports to China, halted due to concerns about atypical bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease).
Varadkar emphasized the importance of a strong and respectful relationship between Ireland and China, emphasizing the 45 years of diplomatic ties, economic relations, and cultural exchanges.
Varadkar said, ""We raised, in particular, our concerns about human rights in what are called the special autonomous regions: Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong, Macau. We need to be frank about these things that China is on the United Nations Human Rights Council and has international responsibilities. Any country, including our own country, should be judged by the way it treats minorities.""
Varadkar said Li was happy to discuss the matters but added, ""I don't want to speak for him, but I think it is fair to say that they would have a very different view of the facts and dispute a lot of what is said in the media.""
The Irish delegation also expressed concerns about the trial of Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai. Premier Li's visit coincided with his participation in the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he addressed global economic issues.
This visit reflects ongoing efforts to develop European Union-China relations despite political tensions, especially regarding Russia's actions in Ukraine and concerns about certain Chinese technologies."

Currently, the fire has been extinguished, and specialists from the enterprise, emergency response services and the Ministry of Emergency Situations are monitoring the residual burnout of hydrocarbons,"" added the company, which is Russia's second-largest national gas producer.Â
Earlier in the day, Leningrad Region Governor Aleksandr Drozdenko said the facility had been set ablaze, adding that employees had been evacuated and that no casualties had been reported.
Based in the Gulf of Finland some 170km west of St. Petersburg and 35km from the Estonian border, the Ust-Luga complex focuses on processing stable gas condensate into light and heavy naphtha, jet fuel, fuel oil, and gasoil. The products processed at its 12 terminals are shipped to international markets through the nearby port, the largest on the Baltic Sea.


In 2022, the facility processed some 7 million tons of gas condensate. The terminal's likely halt due to the incident places Novatek's liquid output and oil-product exports at risk.Local newspaper Fontanka reported that at least two drones were spotted flying towards St. Petersburg before the terminal caught fire. The city's Pulkovo Airport reportedly introduced its 'Kovyor' mode, which involves aircraft departures and landings being suspended due to an external threat.Ukraine has regularly targeted infrastructure in Russian border regions with drone and missile strikes amid the conflict with Moscow, although attacks on targets as far away as Leningrad Region - around 1,000km from the Ukrainian border - are rarer. Earlier this week, however, the Russian military said a Ukrainian drone had attacked the region, the first known occasion that one had been spotted in the area since the launch of Moscow's military operation against Ukraine.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section

The Dixmude, a French helicopter carrier, has been docked in the Egyptian port of al-Arish, 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of the Gaza Strip, since November. The vessel is equipped with wards, operating theaters and 70 medical staff.
A French naval officer stands next to a wounded Palestinian child at the hospital onboard the French ship amphibious helicopter carrier Dixmude, in Al-Arish, Sinai peninsula, Egypt, Jan. 21, 2024.
Nearly 120 injured people have been hospitalized on board, while hundreds more have been seen for outpatient consultations, including follow-ups on injuries and psychiatric issues, said Captain Alexandre Blonce, calling it an 'unprecedented mission.'
Israeli forces launched all-out war to eliminate Gaza's ruling Palestinian Islamist group Hamas after its militants burst across the border into southern Israeli towns and bases on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 253 hostages back to the enclave. Over 25,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war.
WHO Official: Gaza's Health Care System Collapsing
Palestinians have struggled to get medical care at home as tens of thousands have been wounded, with most of Gaza's 36 hospitals no longer functioning, and those remaining operating at far over capacity, the World Health Organization says.
Israel has targeted the largest remaining hospitals, saying Hamas fighters are operating there, something Hamas denies.
A Palestinian boy sits on a bed as he receives treatment at the hospital onboard the French ship amphibious helicopter carrier Dixmude as it docks in the city of Al-Arish, Sinai peninsula, Egypt, Jan. 21, 2024.
Those lucky enough to cross into Egypt, like 16-year-old Ahmed Abu Daqqa, who was injured on Nov. 1, faced long waits for medical care.
Doctors in Gaza 'took out the shrapnel and put in two rods, but a month later they discovered more shrapnel in my knee. They told me they'll handle it later because there were too many surgeries,' he said on board the Dixmude.
'I tried many times to get a transfer' before finally crossing into Egypt, he said.
He was then able to undergo further surgery where the rods and shrapnel were removed and a resulting infection dealt with, as well as receiving physical therapy.
He and others on board the French ship were awaiting further transfers to hospitals in Egypt or abroad.
Italy sent a similar floating hospital to the Egyptian coast in December.

Asking Wang to convey his sincere greetings to Xi, Holness said that China did not hesitate to lend a helping hand when Jamaica encountered difficulties, which has strongly supported Jamaica's economic development and improvement of people's lives, and vividly demonstrated China's sincere will to help developing countries.
Jamaica will continue to firmly adhere to the one-China policy, give priority to the relationship between Jamaica and China, and strive to build a strong strategic partnership between the two countries, the prime minister stressed.
Wang conveyed Xi's cordial greetings, noting that China appreciates Jamaica's firm adherence to the friendly policy towards China and the one-China principle, and thanks Jamaica for understanding and supporting China in safeguarding its core interests.
China advocates that all countries, big or small, are equal and respects Jamaica's choice of a system and way of life with its own characteristics, Wang said.
China supports Jamaica in safeguarding its sovereignty, independence, and national dignity and playing a more important role in regional and international affairs, Wang added.
Wang said that the Belt and Road cooperation between China and Jamaica has achieved fruitful results and has broad prospects.
Briefing the Jamaican side on China's development achievements and centenary goals, Wang said that China is accelerating Chinese modernization and is willing to provide a useful reference for developing countries that hope to achieve rapid development while maintaining independence.
The two sides can share experience in state governance and achieve common development, he added.
Holness said that Chinese modernization has set a benchmark for high-quality development. Noting he has witnessed China's adherence to the principle of equality and treating small and medium-sized countries sincerely, he firmly believes that China will continue to play a leading role in responding to global challenges.
On the same day, Wang also held talks with Jamaican Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade Kamina Johnson Smith."

VDPJ4HOY1Z_I41FH9PN7GXYU67,North Korea Stresses Alignment with Russia Against US,"Voice of America 21st January 2024, 18:06 GMT+11","Voice of America 21st January 2024, 18:06 GMT+11",20240121,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274101771/north-korea-stresses-alignment-with-russia-against-us,"SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA - North Korea said Sunday it has agreed to further strategic and tactical cooperation with Russia to establish a 'new multi-polarized international order,' as the two countries work to build a united front in the face of their separate, intensifying tensions with the United States.
In describing North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui's meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minster Sergey Lavrov in Moscow last week, the North's Foreign Ministry said Putin also reaffirmed his willingness to visit Pyongyang and said that could come at an 'early date.'
North Korea has been actively strengthening its ties with Russia, highlighted by leader Kim Jong Un's September visit to Russia for a summit with Putin. Kim is trying to break out of diplomatic isolation and strengthen his footing as he navigates a deepening nuclear standoff with Washington, Seoul and Tokyo.
In a separate statement on Sunday, the North's Foreign Ministry condemned the U.N. Security Council for calling an emergency meeting over the country's latest ballistic test, which state media described as a new intermediate-range solid-fuel missile tipped with a hypersonic warhead. The ministry said the test-firing on January 14 was among the country's regular activities to improve its defense capabilities and that it didn't pose a threat to its neighbors.
South Korea on Thursday urged the Security Council 'to break the silence' over North Korea's escalating missile tests and threats. Russia and China, both permanent members of the council, have blocked U.S.-led efforts to increase sanctions on North Korea over its recent weapons tests, underscoring a divide deepened over Russia's war on Ukraine.
The alignment between Pyongyang and Moscow has raised international concerns about alleged arms cooperation, in which the North provides Russia with munitions to help prolong its fighting in Ukraine, possibly in exchange for badly needed economic aid and military assistance to help upgrade Kim's forces. Both Pyongyang and Russia have denied accusations by Washington and Seoul about North Korean arms transfers to Russia.
North Korea's Foreign Ministry, in comments published by state media, said Choe and the Russian officials in their meetings expressed a 'strong will to further strengthen strategic and tactical cooperation in defending the core interests of the two countries and establishing a new multi-polarized international order.'
Russia expressed 'deep thanks' to North Korea for its 'full support' over its war on Ukraine, the North Korean ministry said. It said Choe and the Russian officials expressed 'serious concern' over the United States' expanding military cooperation with its Asian allies that they blamed for worsening tensions in the region and threatening North Korea's sovereignty and security interests.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest point in years, after Kim in recent months used Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to ramp up his weapons tests and military demonstrations. The United States, South Korea and Japan have responded by strengthening their combined military exercises, which Kim portrays as invasion rehearsals, and sharpening their deterrence plans built around nuclear-capable U.S. assets.
In the latest tit-for-tat, North Korea on Friday said it conducted a test of a purported nuclear-capable underwater attack drone in response to a combined naval exercise by the United States, South Korea and Japan last week, as it continued to blame its rivals for tensions in the region.
Choe's visit to Moscow came as Kim continues to use domestic political events to issue provocative threats of nuclear conflict.
At Pyongyang's rubber-stamp parliament last week, Kim declared that North Korea is abandoning its long-standing goal of a peaceful unification with war-divided rival South Korea and ordered the rewriting of the North's constitution to cement the South as its most hostile foreign adversary. He accused South Korea of acting as 'top-class stooges' of the Americans and repeated a threat that he would use his nukes to annihilate the South if provoked.
Analysts say North Korea could be aiming to diminish South Korea's voice in the regional nuclear standoff and eventually force direct dealings with Washington as it looks to cement its status as a nuclear weapons state."

Senior Congress leader Raghuveer Reddy alleged that their convoys were obstructed by the Vijayawada police while en route from the airport to Vijayawada.
Reddy suggested that the government is acting out of fear towards the Congress party.
""Such obstruction is indicative of the government's apprehension and anxiety about the rising influence of the Congress party,"" Reddy said.
However, Vijayawada police refuted the allegations made by the state Congress leaders and said that it was a routine halt and had no deliberate interference.

The remarks came after Congress alleged that its vehicles were being attacked by BJP workers in parts of Assam during the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra.
Addressing the public in Nagaon, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said, ""20-25 BJP workers carrying sticks came in front of our bus, and when I came out of the bus, they ran away. They think that Congress is scared of the BJP and RSS. They are dreaming. They can tear as many posters and placards as they want. We don't care. We are not scared of anyone.

What crime did we commit? They said that 1,50,000 youths tried to join the army, and they gave physical and medical. The Modi government wrote to them that they were selected for the army, then COVID happened and they were asked to wait.
""They were told that they would be recruited after Covid will get over. The government kept these 1,50,000 youths waiting for 3 years.

Earlier today, Congress General Secretary Jairam Ramesh alleged that his vehicle was attacked by BJP workers in Assam's Jumugurihat during the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra.
The Congress leader said that he maintained his composure and waved to the ""hooligans,"" who he claimed were part of an ""unruly BJP crowd,"" and blamed state Chief Minister Himanta Sarma for the ""attack"".
Earlier at a press conference on Sunday, the Assam Chief Minister said, ""Rahul Gandhi pehle toh mujhse darta tha, ab mere bacche se bhi darna shuru kar diya (Rahul Gandhi is not just scared of me but also my child).""Rahul Gandhi countered Biswa Sarma saying that the former was afraid of his alleged corruption being uncovered.
""He is making such statements as he is scared. He afraid of his corruption coming out in the open,"" Wayanad MP said.
Previously, similar allegations were made by Congress on Saturday, claiming that the convoy of 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra' was allegedly attacked by ""goons"" from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Assam's Lakhimpur.

""Considering our national life, discipline will have to be created in social life also. We know that Shri Ram-Lakshman had completed 14 years of exile and a successful fight with the powerful Ravana. Justice and compassion, harmony, fairness, and social virtues reflected in the character of Shri Ram, once again spreading in the society, building a manly society based on equal justice without exploitation, endowed with strength as well as compassion, this will be the worship of Shri Ram,"" he said.
He asserted that due to ego, selfishness and discrimination, this world is in a frenzy of destruction and is bringing infinite calamities upon itself.
""The reconstruction of Jagdabhiram Bharatvarsha and 'Sarvesham Avirodhi' which shows the path of harmony, unity, progress and peace, is going to start with the entry of Shri Ram Lalla in Ram Janmabhoomi and his Pran Pratishtha. All of us have resolved to bring to completion the reconstruction of the temple as well as the reconstruction of India and hence the entire world in the devotional celebration of 22 January. Move forward by establishing this feeling in your heart,"" he added.
He further said that foreign invaders destroyed temples in India to demoralize the Indian society so that India would become permanently weak and they could rule over them.
""The history of our India is the history of continuous struggle against the invaders for the last one and a half thousand years. The purpose of early invasions was to plunder and sometimes (like Sikander's invasions) to establish a kingdom. However, the attacks from the West in the name of Islam only brought destruction and isolation of the society. To demoralize the country and society, it was necessary to destroy their religious places, hence the foreign invaders also destroyed the temples in India. They did this not once, but many times. They aimed to demoralize the Indian society so that the Indians would become permanently weak and they could rule over them unhindered,"" Mohan Bhagwat said.
""The demolition of Shri Ram temple in Ayodhya was also done with the same intention and for the same purpose. This policy of the invaders was not limited to just Ayodhya or any one temple, but was for the entire world,"" he added.
The RSS chief also mentioned that in 1857, when war plans started being made against the foreign power i.e., the British power, Hindus and Muslims together showed readiness to fight against them and then there was a mutual exchange of ideas between them. At that time, a situation was created where there would be a reconciliation on the issue of banning cow slaughter and the liberation of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi. Bahadur Shah Zafar also included a ban on cow slaughter in his manifesto.
""Therefore all societies fought together. Indians showed bravery in that war but unfortunately, this war failed, and India did not get independence, British rule remained uninterrupted, but the struggle for Ram Temple did not stop. According to the policy of ""Divide and Rule"" of the British among Hindu Muslims, which was already in practice and became more and more strict. To break the unity, the British hanged the heroes of the struggle in Ayodhya and the question of liberation of Ram Janmabhoomi remained the same,"" Mohan Bhagwat said.
Further, mentioning the Supreme Court's order on the Ram Mandir, Bhagwat said that the Apex Court gave a balanced decision after listening to both sides and examining the truth and facts.
""On November 9, 2019, after 134 years of legal struggle, the Supreme Court gave a balanced decision after examining the truth and facts. The feelings and facts of both parties were also considered in this decision. This decision has been given after hearing the arguments of all the parties in the court. According to this decision, a board of trustees was established for the construction of the temple. Bhoomi Pujan of the temple took place on August 5, 2020, and now, accordingly, the installation and Pran Pratishtha ceremony of the idol of Shri Ramlala has been organized on 22 January 2024,"" he said in his letter.

This comes after a report claimed that Netanyahu told Biden that the public comments he made a day earlier -- in which he appeared to reject the idea of creating a Palestinian state -- were not meant to foreclose that outcome in any form.
""In his conversation last night with President Biden, Prime Minister Netanyahu repeated his consistent position for years, which he also expressed at a press conference the day before: after the elimination of Hamas, Israel must remain in full security control of the Gaza Strip to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, and this conflicts with the demand for Palestinian sovereignty,"" the Israel PM Office said in a statement.
The CNN report follows similar comments from Biden himself, who said that the creation of an independent state for Palestinians is not impossible while Netanyahu is still in office and that the two leaders discussed the issue during their phone call on Friday.
On being asked if whether a two-state solution was impossible with Netanyahu still in office, Biden told reporters on Friday, ""No it's not.""On being asked about the recent statement by Netanyahu. Biden said, ""I think we'll be able to work something out.""President Biden further elaborated that there might be ""types"" of two-state solutions that Netanyahu may not be opposed to.
""There are a number of types of two-state solutions. There's a number of countries that are members of the UN that are still -- don't have their own militaries. Number of states that have limitations...and so I think there's ways in which this could work,"" Biden further said.
Earlier on Thursday, Netanyahu said in a press conference, that ""in any future arrangement, or in the absence of an arrangement,"" Israel must maintain ""security control"" of all territory west of the Jordan River -- meaning, Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. ""That is a vital condition,"" the Times of Israel reported.
He added that this ""contradicts the idea of sovereignty [for the Palestinians]. What can you do? I tell this truth to our American friends.""On Friday, US President Joe Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after nearly a month and reiterated his vision of a 'two-state solution' while guaranteeing Israel's security.
The US President also discussed the ongoing efforts to secure the release of all remaining hostages under Hamas captivity and reviewed the situation in Gaza.
""The President discussed Israel's responsibility even as it maintains military pressure on Hamas and its leaders to reduce civilian harm and protect the innocent. The President also discussed his vision for a more durable peace and security for Israel fully integrated within the region and a two-state solution with Israel's security guaranteed,"" the White House statement added.

However, PK Sekar Babu, Minister of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments said that the allegations made by the BJP leader are being spread in an attempt to divert people's attention from the DMK Youth Conference in Salem.
The Finance Minister claimed that the Tamil Nadu government has also banned live telecast of Ayodhya's Ram Temple inauguration.
""TN govt has banned watching the live telecast of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir programmes of Jan 22. In TN there are over 200 temples for Shri Ram. In HRCE-managed temples, no puja, bhajan, prasadam/annadanam in the name of Shri Ram is allowed. Police are also stopping privately held temples from organising events. They are threatening organisers that they will rip off pandals. Strongly condemn this anti-Hindu, hateful action,"" Sitharaman posted on X.
Sharing a clip from a media report, Nirmala claimed that cable TV operators are told that there is a likely power shutdown during the live telecast.
""Heartbreaking scenes in several parts of TN. People are threatened for organising bhajans, feeding the poor, and celebrating with sweets, even as we wish to watch PM Narendra Modiparticipate in Ayodhya. Cable TV operators are told that there is a likely power shutdown during the live telecast. This is I.N.D.I Alliance partner DMK's anti-Hindu efforts,"" she added.
The Finance Minister stated that the enthusiasm displayed by people in Tamil Nadu for the Ram Temple inauguration has rattled DMK.
""TN government is unofficially claiming law and order issues to justify the live telecast ban. False and fake narrative! There were no LO issues on the day of the Ayodhya verdict. Not even the day when PM Narendra Modi laid the foundation in any part of the country. The groundswell and the voluntary participation of people to celebrate ShriRam in TN have rattled the anti-Hindu DMK,"" she added.
Refuting the claims made by Finance Minister, PK Sekar Babu, Minister of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments said that the allegations made by Nirmala Sitharaman are completely untrue.
""Strongly condemn the spreading of false information in an attempt to divert people's attention from the DMK Youth Conference in Salem. The Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments department hasn't imposed any limitations on devotees' freedom to offer food, conduct poojas in the name of Shri Ram, or provide prasad in Tamil Nadu temples. It is unfortunate that people in office, like Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and others, are purposefully propagating this erroneous information,"" Babu posted on X.
Tamil Nadu BJP President K Annamalai also stated that Tamil Nadu, which held an important place during the Ramayana, has now been shadowed by shallow-minded administrators of the state.
""The DMK government in TN has taken their anti-Sanathana Dharma stand to an extreme level by imposing a blanket ban on conducting special pooja and Annadhana in temples during Pran Prathishtha in Ayodhya. The HRCE department has denied permissions verbally, and the TN Police department has been citing frivolous reasons for rejecting the request to telecast the programme live on a large LED screen that Tamil Nadu BJP and other organisations have arranged for the benefit of the devotees,"" Annamalai said.
He further informed that special poojas and bhajans will be organised by the Tamil Nadu BJP to celebrate Pran Pratishtha ceremony in Ayodhya.
""Tomorrow, cadres of the Tamil Nadu BJP, along with the people of Tamil Nadu, will perform special poojas and bhajans in the glory of Bhagwan Shri Ram in all the temples in TN to celebrate the historic Pran Pratikshtha in Ayodhya,"" Annamalai added.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will perform rituals to mark the 'Pran Pratishtha'; a team of priests led by Lakshmikant Dixit will lead the main rituals.
Meanwhile, senior AIADMK leader and former Chief Minister O Panneerselvam has also requested that the Tamil Nadu government declare a public holiday on the occasion of the Ram Temple inauguration.

According to a statement released by the state-run Saba news agency, the council warned the Houthis against the consequences of intensifying attacks, targeting civilian sites, and undermining peace efforts.
Government sources said that recent days have seen Houthi mobilization and repositioning of fighters, vehicles, and weapons on various fronts of the war-ravaged Arab country.
The statement praised ""the preparedness of Yemeni armed forces and popular resistance groups defending the country's state institutions and countering the Houthi aggression.""
The PLC also reviewed the potential impacts on global shipping and trade from repeated Houthi attacks in territorial waters, expressing hope that international unity would strengthen Yemen's capabilities to protect its waters and sovereignty.
Observers said that the PLC's meeting signals heightened tensions and a potential return to active fighting between the Houthi group and pro-government forces.
The Houthis have been engaged in a civil war against the government since 2014, causing a massive humanitarian crisis. Despite Saudi-led efforts to restore the internationally recognized government, the conflict remains deadlocked."

They are preparing to light a 'Diya' each in all temples of Mauritius and the verses of the 'Ramayan Path' will echo through the corridors of these temples, creating an atmosphere of devotion and cultural celebration.
Mauritius High Commissioner Dillum said, ""There are a lot of temples in Mauritius, and in all the temples, one 'diya' (earthen lamp) will be lit, and 'Ramayan Path' will be recited during that day.""This symbolic gesture is poised to create a luminous tapestry across the island nation, reflecting the shared reverence for Lord Ram.

The Mauritian envoy also stated that the ceremony on January 22 is not just a great event for India but also the people of Mauritius.
""Preparations are going on and any event that touches the hearts of all Mauritians is a big event. It's believed that Lord Ram is coming back again. So I think this is a great event not only for India but also for the people of Mauritius, and they are keen and willing to follow the Pran Pratishtha ceremony,"" Dillum said.

Israel has killed between just 20% and 30% of Hamas' fighters in Gaza since declaring war on the Palestinian militant group following its cross-border raid on October 7, according to US intelligence estimates reported by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday.
In a classified report compiled earlier this month, Washington estimated Hamas had between 25,000 and 30,000 fighters in Gaza before the war, plus thousands of members of the territory's police force and other authorities, basing its estimates on intercepted communications, drone surveillance, and Israeli intelligence.
In addition to the estimated 5,000 to 9,000 dead militants, another 10,500 to 11,700 Hamas fighters have been wounded, a US official told the WSJ, clarifying that many of the latter could return to combat. The remaining fighters are likely doing ""two or three jobs,"" having assumed the responsibilities of their fallen comrades, retired Army Gen. Joseph Votel surmised.
Hamas, which has governed Gaza since 2007, also retains the firepower to continue striking Israel - and Israel Defense Forces assets in the Palestinian territories - ""for months,"" according to the Journal, which added that the group is currently trying to reestablish its police force in Gaza City despite much of the densely populated area being reduced to rubble.
Israel's own estimates placed the starting number of Hamas fighters higher, at 30,000 or more, and credited the Israel Defense Forces with killing more members of the group - 9,000 during the war plus 1,000 during the raid that preceded it. Its estimate of 16,000 wounded Palestinian militants was also notably higher, as was its claim regarding the seriousness of those wounds - half of the injured won't be fighting anymore, a senior Israeli military official told the WSJ.
The US has tacitly acknowledged the failure of Israel's three-month bombardment of Gaza to bring about the destruction of Hamas, its stated goal in waging war on the enclave. The administration of President Joe Biden has repeatedly urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reduce civilian casualties and adopt a more ""surgical"" strategy targeting high-ranking members of the organization rather than low-level fighters, even while lowering its own expectations from the obliteration of Hamas to its degradation as a security threat.
In announcing the withdrawal of thousands of troops from Gaza earlier this month, West Jerusalem, too, appeared to acknowledge the failure of its scorched-earth tactics, which have killed nearly 25,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The high reported rate of civilian casualties has triggered allegations of genocidal intent from the international community, culminating in a case filed by South Africa against Israel in the International Court of Justice.

The EAM was interacting with the people of the Indian community in Nigeria on Sunday (local time).
""The life of every Indian citizen has become easier and this is because we have embraced technology in a very deep way. You can see this in payment, very few people today pay in cash and very few people accept cash...Today, we do as many cashless payments in India in a month as much as America does in three years,"" Jaishankar said at the event.
He further highlighted the five major examples that showcase the transformation of India in the last decade.
""For me, how a country deals with a challenge, recovers from the challenge, and is able to pose such a strong economic performance, how the life of an average citizen becomes better, how we are capable of something that captures the imagination of the world and how do we look after our people outside the country. These are five true examples of what changed in India in the last decade,"" Jaishankar said.
The EAM also lauded the way India dealt with Covid pandemic while pointing that many countries have still not been able to cope with the impact and highlighting that New Delhi brought back 7 million of its people from abroad.
""I take great heart, great hope and great faith from how India dealt with it. When Covid started, during a virtual meeting in 2020, it was said that the country that will be most unable to cope with Covid would be India. Two years later, I saw that we went through the Covid wave, and lockdowns...we started making medicines for the rest of the world,"" he further said.
Stressing that India is the fastest-growing economy in the world, Jaishankar said that business sentiment about New Delhi has improved and as a result, the flow of investments into the country has reached its highest ever.
""Today, what is happening in the economy...we are the fastest-growing big economy in the world...but it is much more than that. Today, if you see the economic activity in India, wherever you go, something is being built. A metro is being built, a road is being built, new airports are coming up, new trains are coming up, railway stations are coming up. If you go to your village, piped water is coming up, there is electricity connection coming,"" Jaishankar said.
He added, ""There is a sense today that India is being built at a fantastic pace, not just being built, that growth rate actually covers many other things. You can see the flow of investment in India, the highest ever. Look at the business sentiment about India. For me, the real change is the change I see in our own people"".
Notably, Jaishankar is on a visit to Nigeria from January 21-23. During this, he will co-chair the 6th India-Nigeria Joint Commission Meeting (JCM) with his counterpart and meet with other leaders.
Prior to this, he also led the Indian delegation at the 19th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), to be held in Kampala, Uganda.
He also met several foreign leaders and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on the sidelines of the summit.
The EAM will also inaugurate the 3rd edition of the Nigeria-India Business Council meeting, deliver a speech at the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs, interact with CII Business delegates and inaugurate the bust of Mahatma Gandhi.
He will also chair the regional conference of Indian Heads of Missions. India and Nigeria have traditionally enjoyed close and friendly relations. This is EAM's first visit to Nigeria, which will further consolidate bilateral relations between the two countries, the release said. (ANI)"

Stephane Dujarric, a spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, was asked on Wednesday whether, given the sizable UN presence amid a multitude of Gazan agencies, the organisation had any indication the tunnels were being constructed.
""No is clearly the answer for that,"" he said. ""It seems to me that all this infrastructure was built in a highly secretive way.""Gilad Erdan, Israel's UN ambassador, responded with a tweet containing two letters he personally wrote to Guterres documenting Hamas tunnels and their proximity to sensitive sites, including UN facilities.
The Israeli envoy also cited a 2022 statement by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) condemning the presence of a ""man-made cavity"" beneath one of its Gaza schools as a breach of neutrality and international law.
Additionally, Erdan claimed he had briefed UNRWA Commissioner-General Phillipe Lazzarini on the tunnels in 2021.
Still, Dujarric insisted on Wednesday that the United Nations was unaware of the sophisticated labyrinth of tunnels being dug and fortified throughout Gaza.
""I mean, just to see it as an observer, to think that the U.N. had any understanding of what was,"" he said, ""any information about those operations, I think, is: No is clearly the answer for that.""Dujarric told TPS on Friday that he meant to say that the United Nations was unaware of any building of tunnels going on at a given moment. Conceding that the body was aware of Hamas tunnels, Dujarric said the organisation had no insight as to Hamas' building plans and therefore could not identify construction as it was happening.
Hamas and its war with Israel will take up much of the conversation in this coming Tuesday's open quarterly U.N. Security Council debate on the Israeli-Palestinian file. The session will be held at the ministerial level, bringing many foreign ministers and other high-level diplomats to the council chambers.
Israel's foreign minister will apparently not be among them. A spokesman for the Israeli mission to the United Nations told TPS that he is unaware of any plans for Israel Katz to fly in for the session.
Katz is scheduled to be in Brussels on Monday, when the European Union's 27 foreign ministers will meet to discuss the Israel-Hamas war and the situation in the Red Sea. The foreign ministers for the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia will also join, as will the secretary general of the Arab League.
The last time Israel's foreign minister travelled to the United Nations, a diplomatic war broke out. In late October, at the last quarterly debate, Guterres told the Security Council that Hamas' Oct. 7 massacre ""did not happen in a vacuum,"" going on to describe a laundry list of Palestinian grievances.
The statement was met with rage and indignation across the Israeli political spectrum, and then-Foreign Minister Eli Cohen cancelled a meeting with Guterres scheduled for that afternoon.
It is unclear if Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian will make it to New York on Tuesday. The Islamic Republic's top diplomat attempted to travel for a Security Council meeting on Gaza in late November, but claimed the U.S. State Department issued visas for him and his delegation to travel from Tehran only seven hours before the meeting was to get underway.
It is not unheard of for the State Department to play a game of chicken with diplomats from unfriendly countries in issuing last-minute visas, thereby fulfilling its duties as a UN host country while making it inconvenient or unfeasible for delegations to arrive on time. (ANI/TPS)"

Nearly 40% of jobs across the globe could be affected by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), with high-income economies more exposed than emerging markets and low-income countries, the IMF has warned in a new report.
In a blog post over the weekend, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva called for governments to tackle the ""troubling trend"" and to proactively take steps ""to prevent the technology from further stoking social tensions.""
""We are on the brink of a technological revolution that could jumpstart productivity, boost global growth and raise incomes around the world. Yet it could also replace jobs and deepen inequality,"" Georgieva stated.
The report pointed out that while automation and information technology have historically tended to affect routine tasks, AI is also capable of impacting jobs requiring highly skilled workers. As a result, advanced economies face greater risks from AI - but also more opportunities to leverage its benefits - than emerging-market and developing economies, according to the IMF.
The report showed that in advanced economies about 60% of jobs may be impacted by AI. However, roughly half of the exposed jobs may benefit from AI integration, thus enhancing productivity, the IMF wrote. For the other half, AI applications may ""execute key tasks currently performed by humans,"" which could curtail demand for labor, leading to lower wages and reduced hiring. In the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear entirely, Georgieva warned.
In emerging markets and low-income countries, by contrast, AI exposure is expected to be 40% and 26%, respectively. ""These findings suggest emerging market and developing economies face fewer immediate disruptions from AI. At the same time, many of these countries don't have the infrastructure or skilled workforces to harness the benefits of AI, raising the risk that over time the technology could worsen inequality among nations,"" the IMF concluded.

The idea of this alliance emerged from the G20 Leaders' Declaration and India's abiding commitment to the cause of women-led development as propounded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
As a follow-up to the activities of the Engagement Group and initiatives under the G20 framework, inter alia, Business 20, Women 20, and G20 EMPOWER, this alliance aims at taking forward the commitments of the G20 leaders for the benefit of the larger global community.
R Dinesh, the President of the Confederation of Indian Industry, the apex industry chamber, said that the leadership of India for women's empowerment during its G20 presidency was well recognised, and the launch of the 'Alliance for Global Good - Gender Equity and Equality' at Davos is yet another opportunity to converge stakeholders to make the world a better place for women.
""We in corporate India are excited to partner with governments and companies across the globe to promote gender equality and strengthen women's leadership,"" he said.
Chandrajit Banerjee, the Director General of CII, has also lauded the initiative, saying that the launch of the 'Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality' at Davos is a purposeful initiative with the participation of key stakeholders.
""It represents a very proud moment for India and India Inc. and comes with a sense of great responsibility. The Confederation of Indian Industry is committed to bringing in industry from India and across the globe to work towards gender equity and women's leadership,"" it added.
The aim of the alliance is to bring together global good practices, knowledge sharing, and investments in the fields of women's health, education, and enterprise.
The alliance has garnered support from industry leaders such as MasterCard, Uber, Tata, TVS, Bayer, Godrej, the Serum Institute of India, Novartis, IMD Laussane, and over 10,000 partners from industry through CII. Supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the alliance will be housed and anchored by the CII Centre for Women Leadership. The World Economic Forum has come on board as a 'Network Partner' and Invest India as an 'Institutional Partner'.
The CII further said that given India's abiding commitment to 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam--One Earth, One Family, One Future' and its continued efforts towards 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Prayaas', this alliance is poised to be a force to reckon with on all gender-related issues. (ANI)"

Earlier on Saturday, the US conducted airstrikes against a Houthi anti-ship missile that was aimed into the Gulf of Aden and was prepared to launch, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) said.
Washington said its forces determined the missile presented a threat to merchant vessels and US Navy ships in the region and therefore struck and destroyed the missile in 'self-defence'.
Recently, the US carried out another round of attack against the Houthi rebels in Yemen, destroying three anti-ship missiles in the Red Sea.
The White House confirmed in a statement that this was the fourth preemptive action taken by the US military amid boiling tensions in the Red Sea.
Notably, the US redesignated the Yemeni group as a ""terrorist"" organisation in response to its continuing attacks and threats to shipping and imposed sanctions on it. The designation does not go into effect for 30 days.

More than 100,000 people in Finland received extended sick leave from their employers due to mental health concerns in 2023, according to the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela). The government agency said in a press release that it was the most common reason for illness-related work absences last year.
Mental health disorders such as anxiety or depression have become the single most common reason for illness-related absences, Kela said, adding that its data showed an upward trend since 2016 - which includes a 3% rise in mental health work absences in 2023 compared the year prior.
""If we want to change the trend,"" Kela research head Jenni Blomgren said, ""it is important that we intervene in working conditions and social structures that add to people's mental load.""
Blomgren stated that Kela's analysis also showed that almost half of the cases involved people who had been diagnosed with anxiety, and noted that the biggest increase in such disorders were seen in people younger than 35.
Kela, which offers compensation for long-term work absences after at least ten days of sick leave, said that it paid out a total of about 15 million sick leave days in 2023 - a sum total of around â¬900 million ($980 million).
The government agency said that, while a higher total compensatory sum was paid out last year, there were almost 10,000 fewer recipients than in 2022, a downturn that Kela attributes to the decline of Covid-19.
In 2023, the agency issued payments to approximately 4,000 diagnosed with Covid-19 who were subsequently unable to work. In 2022, some 18,000 people claimed the same benefits. Blomgren added that the impact of Covid-19 on Finnish society was not now as ""significantly visible"" as it had been in previous years.
Under Kela's sickness allowance scheme, the agency will compensate workers who experience a loss of earnings due to a medical issue. A doctor's certificate is required to access the benefit plan, and Kela will pay sickness allowance for no more than one year. If a worker still receives wages during illness, the benefit payments are instead made to the person's employer.

Details of the dispute, filed on January 18 with the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), are not fully clear from the announcement. The Bulgarian companies ""Mirastar"" and NDS, part of the Nexo group, are listed as plaintiffs, while the Ministry of Finance and the Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Bulgaria are named as defendants.
ICSID, part of the World Bank Group, facilitates dispute resolution through conciliation, arbitration, or fact-finding in investor-state disputes. Nexo's legal action follows the prosecutor's decision to abandon the investigation that began with high-profile searches and accusations.
In December 2023, Antoni Trenchev, one of Nexo's founders, revealed that the dropped investigation might cost the state millions. Trenchev warned that the company was assessing the damage caused by the prosecution, estimating it at over billion. Though he initially considered going to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, Nexo has now opted for an international arbitration case in the USA.
Trenchev and his partner, Kosta Kanchev, faced accusations related to unauthorized banking transactions through the Nexo online platform. These transactions involved lending and deposit activities without the appropriate authorization under the Law on Credit Institutions. Despite the initial accusations, the supervising prosecutors concluded that there was insufficient evidence of a crime after interviews and examinations.

DeSantis, 45, endorsed Trump in a video posted to the X social media site.
DeSantis had been widely seen as a top contender for the 2024 Republican nomination and a natural heir to Trump due to his combative style and deeply conservative views. Early in 2023, he led several head-to-head polls against Trump.
But the Florida governor's support has been declining for several months, due to a flawed campaign strategy, his seeming lack of ease with voters on the campaign trail and Trump's so far unshakeable hold on much of the party's base.
The end of DeSantis' bid means that former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, is now the last Republican in the race with a shot - albeit a long one - of denying Trump the nomination. The winner of the Republican nominating contest will take on President Joe Biden, the likely Democratic nominee, in the general election in November.
More than 70% of Republicans have a favorable opinion of Trump, according to most opinion polls. That put DeSantis in a position where he had to appeal to voters who still admired Trump, as well as those who passionately disliked him.
DeSantis failed on both counts. He never successfully articulated to most Trump supporters why he was a better option, while Republicans looking to ditch the former president split their votes among multiple candidates. Haley, in particular, has emerged as the favorite among moderate Republicans as the field has consolidated. Where DeSantis differed from Trump on policy, it was almost always to stake out a more conservative position. He signed a six-week abortion ban in Florida in April, which he eventually embraced on the campaign trail, even as it made some donors and moderate Republicans wary.
DeSantis opposed additional U.S. military assistance to Ukraine and took punitive actions against the Walt Disney Co. after the company spoke out against Florida legislation that limited discussion of gender and sexuality in classrooms.
The Disney fight was one that pro-business critics within the party said DeSantis didn't need to wage.
While many major donors threw their support behind DeSantis early on, they began to rebel as early as the summer.
Robert Bigelow, who gave millions to the super PAC fundraising group backing DeSantis, told Reuters in August he was cutting off funding, turned off by the governor's uncompromising position on abortion.
Campaign errors
DeSantis' troubles began before he ever entered the race.
In March, when Trump was indicted in New York on charges he conspired to conceal hush money payments to a porn star, the former president received a significant bump in the polls as Republicans rallied around him. Many of them believed Trump's claims that law enforcement officials were targeting him to keep him out of office.
Several DeSantis allies say the governor waited too long to become a candidate, finally throwing his hat into the ring in May, more than six months after Trump had done so. That left DeSantis open to blistering attacks by Trump, while the governor himself did little to defend himself, insisting he was not a candidate.
When DeSantis did formally launch his White House run in May 2023, it was a glitch-filled disaster on Twitter, now known as X, an inauspicious start for a campaign predicated on the governor's executive competence.
The campaign then overhired, burning through cash at a rapid rate. DeSantis let go of some 38 staffers in July and ousted his campaign manager in August, sowing a narrative of internal chaos that proved hard to shake.
He outsourced much of the traditional work of a campaign to an outside super PAC, which can accept donations of unlimited size, but cannot coordinate with the campaign itself.
The campaign and the PAC, known as Never Back Down, came to distrust one another. A series of back-to-back departures of senior staffers from the PAC in November and December created a sense of turmoil that furthered the narrative that the governor's campaign was mortally wounded.

This is the second time when Salman has been invited to Joy Awards.
Several pictures and videos of Salman from this year's Joy Awards went viral on social media.
In one of the pics, Salman could be seen posing with the 'Hannibal' actor Anthony Hopkins.
The 'Kick' actor looked handsome as he a donned lavender shirt with a violet-grey suit and sported a moustache and beard.
In another viral video, the 'Dabangg' actor is seen presenting an award to a senior Egyptian actor on stage.
In the year 2022, Salman was honoured with 'Personality of the Year' award at the event. This year too, he has been invited by the dignitaries to be a special guest from India at the award function.
Apart from him, actor Alia Bhatt also attended the event in Riyadh.
Meanwhile, on the work front, Salman is basking in the success of 'Tiger 3'.
On seeing the love that the audience has been showering on the film, Salman said, ""The Tiger franchise has got unanimous love right from the first film be it theatrically, on satellite or on streaming!

ZD4J2JN2Y7_M81FG98S03U0RM5,Trump claims rival not able to deal with Putin,"RT.com 22nd January 2024, 01:13 GMT+11","RT.com 22nd January 2024, 01:13 GMT+11",20240121,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274101993/trump-claims-rival-not-able-to-deal-with-putin,"The former US president says he ?probably? wouldn?t select Nikki Haley as his running mate if he secures the GOP nomination
Former US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley does not have the capacity for high level politics, Donald Trump told supporters at a campaign event in New Hampshire on Friday. The former US president questioned his Republican rival's ability to deal with world leaders such as Russia's Vladimir Putin or China's Xi Jinping.
While former South Carolina governor Haley seeks to consolidate her second place in the race for the GOP presidential ticket ahead of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, Trump said she is not ""tough enough"" for the job.
""She's not presidential timber,"" he stated at a campaign event in Concord. ""Now when I say that, that probably means that she's not going to be chosen as the vice president.""
Trump currently holds a commanding lead in the race to challenge the presumptive Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, in November's election, according to polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight.
He currently holds more than 66% of Republican support, the website said on Friday, placing him significantly ahead of second-placed Haley (12.3%) - who, in turn, is 1.2 percentage points ahead of Florida governor Ron DeSantis.
""I know her very well,"" Trump added of Haley, whom he appointed as US ambassador to the United Nations in 2017. ""She's not tough enough. She's not smart enough. And she wasn't respected enough. She cannot do this job.""
Trump added: ""She's not going to be able to deal with President Xi. She's not going to be able to deal with Putin.""
Haley, meanwhile, has on several occasions distanced herself from seeking the vice presidential nomination. ""I am not running to be vice president,"" she said in Iowa last month. ""I don't play for second. I've never done it in my life. I'm not doing it.""
""I think that he [Trump] is not going to even have to worry about picking a VP,"" she said separately to Fox News. ""I know that I will in six months.""
Somewhat bizarrely, Trump - who has frequently questioned Biden's mental acuity on the campaign trail - appeared to mix up Haley with former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in an extended statement in New Hampshire on Friday regarding the January 6, 2021 riots at the US Capitol.
""Nikki Haley is in charge of security [at the Capitol],"" Trump incorrectly said. ""We offered her 10,000 people, soldiers, National Guards, whatever they want [to quell the riots]. They turned it down. They don't want to talk about that.""
The Biden campaign posted the video clip to social media late on Friday, saying of the gaffe: ""A deeply confused Trump confuses Nancy Pelosi and Nikki Haley multiple times.""

The Shrine further said that we are expecting a sizable number of devotees in Batadrava Than.
""Ram Temple will be inaugurated in Ayodhya on Monday. We are expecting a sizable number of devotees in Batadrava Than. We learnt that there are several programs that are scheduled to happen around Batadrava. Keeping all these aspects in mind, the, the committee is of the view that the Congress parliamentarian should plan his visit after 3 pm,"" they added.
""There are no chances of letting him enter Batadrava Than premises before 3 pm,"" the shrine said.
The 'Pran Pratishtha' of Shri Ram Lalla at Ayodhya's temple will take place on Monday.

The 'Pran Pratishtha' of Shri Ram Lalla at Ayodhya Temple will be held on Monday at 12:30 pm.
Trivedi said that as Lord Ram returns, India has become the world's fifth-largest economy, fourth-largest stock exchange, third-largest automobile manufacturer, and second-largest mobile device maker.
""Lord Ram is entering his abode in Ayodhya, as 40 million poor people have houses. Roads have reached every village. Electricity has reached every village. 110 million people have toilets. All women have gas, and that's not all. If you see, we have become the fifth-largest economy. We have become the fourth-largest stock exchange. We have become the third-largest automobile manufacturer.
