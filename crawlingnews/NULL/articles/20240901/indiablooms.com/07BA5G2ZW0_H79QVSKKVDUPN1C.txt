" This evening, Pitt Police arrested an individual in connection to an appalling incident near the Cathedral of Learning in which a group of Jewish students was attacked by an individual wielding a bottle," read the university website.
Two students were treated at the scene.
"The alleged perpetrator, who has no known Pitt affiliation, was immediately arrested by Pitt Police and is in custody," the statement said.
Upon learning about this incident, Pitt leadership contacted Hillel University Center to offer support to our students and also connected with our partners at the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh.
"We are grateful to our Pitt Police officers for their swift action, and our Student Affairs team for their ongoing student support," the university said in a statement.
"While there is not believed to be any ongoing threat to the public stemming from this incident, we recognize that incidents like these are unsettling to our Pitt community," the statement said.
"Neither acts of violence nor antisemitism will be tolerated. Local and federal partners are supporting Pitt Police in this ongoing investigation," the university said.
