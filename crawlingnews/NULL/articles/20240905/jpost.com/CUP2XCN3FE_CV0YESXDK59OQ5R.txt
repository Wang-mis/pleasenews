Israel should still engage in hostage negotiations and have conversations to see what can get done, Florida Sen. Rick Scott told reporters outside the Republican Jewish Coalition’s annual summit in Las Vegas on Wednesday night, although a previous post on X indicated the senator no longer believed in ceasefire negotiations.“Hamas terrorists murdered six hostages, including an American citizen, just days ago, 333 days after October 7. These same monsters are still holding 60+ innocent people hostage. We cannot rest or stop putting pressure on Hamas, not Israel,” Scott wrote on X on Tuesday.“Hamas isn’t interested in a ceasefire or compromise,” Scott continued. “The solution here is to bring every hostage home and destroy Hamas. Anything else is unacceptable.”  He was unclear on whether he believed in the negotiation process to release hostages or to free hostages through military action.“Destroy it, kill every Hamas member, and also get every individual home,” Scott said to reporters.
