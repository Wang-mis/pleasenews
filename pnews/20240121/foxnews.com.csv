035VTU3JHA_7IQLTX1GOPNH5T2,"Trump talks 2024 with Bret Baier, says Biden is ‘very dangerous’ and ‘can’t put two sentences together’",By Bradford Betz Fox News,"Published January 21, 2024 3:46pm EST",20240121,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-talks-2024-bret-baier-says-biden-very-dangerous-cant-put-two-sentences-together,"New Hampshire’s highly anticipated primary comes on Tuesday, January 23.
Fox News’ Bret Baier caught up with former President Donald Trump in Bedford, New Hampshire on Saturday to discuss the 2024 presidential race ahead of Tuesday’s highly anticipated primary in the state.
The 2024 frontrunner discussed beating GOP rivals Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who came in second, and former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who came in third in the Iowa primary.
Trump hit back at Haley after she questioned the former commander-in-chief’s mental capacity after he appeared to mix her up with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during a rally this week.

""She’s just trying to get a little nasty because she came in third place. She wanted to come in second. And she wasn’t even that close, actually, to second. You know, I have to give that to Ron De-sanctimonious,"" Trump said, referring to his penchant for coming up with nicknames for his opponents. Most recently, Trump referred to Haley – the daughter of Indian immigrants – as ""Nimbra,"" referring to her birth name of ""Nimrata.""
FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY SAYS IT'S ‘ABSOLUTELY’ POSSIBLE FORMER PRESIDENT IS CONVICTED
Haley earned 21,085 caucus votes, or just under 20% in Iowa, putting her behind second-place finisher Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who had 23,420 votes, or 21.2%. Trump trounced all of his challengers, winning an outright majority at 51%, with 56,260 votes in a historic caucus victory that resoundingly confirmed his frontrunner status.
That frontrunner status was further cemented later Sunday when DeSantis dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Trump.

Responding to Haley’s assertion that Trump’s political indictments have become a liability on the campaign trail, Trump dismissed them as ""Biden indictments.""
""He is bad for democracy … He is very dangerous,"" Trump said of his Democratic rival in the White House. ""He can’t win fair and square. The guy can’t put two sentences together.""
Trump also took shots at Fani Willis, the Fulton County District Attorney who was accused of having an improper romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she appointed to prosecute the election interference case against the former president.
""They did this. This is all political stuff, and it’s a very bad thing for our country,"" Trump said. ""And remember, that goes the other way too. If a Republican gets in … they can do the same thing to a Democrat.""
On the question of a potential pick for vice president, Trump said: ""There’s no rush to that.""

The Texas Department of Public Safety said an illegal immigrant was found dead on Saturday after attempting to cross the Rio Grande in Eagle Pass.
The department's Tactical Marine Unit recovered an unidentified deceased man from a shallow portion of the river south of Shelby Park at about 2:30 p.m., Texas DPS spokesperson Lt. Chris Olivarez wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.
""Another tragedy from crossing the dangerous Rio Grande in Eagle Pass,"" Olivarez wrote.
There have been roughly 2,300 illegal immigrant deaths in the last three years from drownings, heat exhaustion, vehicle accidents or hazardous conditions attributed to human smuggling and harsh environmental conditions, according to Olivarez.

Texas is using every preventive measure to deter illegal border crossings, Olivarez said. He said this type of preventative action ""requires a federal response to apply consequences & enact current laws to prevent anyone from crossing the river.""
This comes after three migrants – a woman and two children – drowned just over a week ago in the Rio Grande. Federal officials and U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, initially claimed the state was responsible for the deaths of the three migrants following accusations that the Texas Military Department had denied Border Patrol access to Shelby Park to help six migrants in distress.
But an investigation by the Texas Military Department determined the accusations were ""wholly inaccurate"" and that the drownings had already happened by the time Border Patrol requested access to the area.
""At the time that Border Patrol requested access, the drownings had occurred, Mexican Authorities were recovering the bodies, and Border Patrol expressed these facts to the TMD personnel on site,"" the TMD said in a news release last week.

The Texas Military Department said its soldiers were in direct communication with Border Patrol on Jan. 12 when it requested access to Shelby Park upon learning of distressed migrants. Soldiers said they told Border Patrol when it requested access that Mexican authorities had already recovered the bodies of two drowned migrants.
Border Patrol specifically requested access to the park to secure two additional migrants who were presumed to have traveled with the ones who had died, but had crossed to the boat ramp, the press release said. Two migrants were apprehended by the Texas Military Department, with one turned over to the Department of Public Safety and the other transferred to EMS for initial hypothermic conditions.
The soldiers then continued to use lights, night vision goggles and thermals to ensure no more migrants were in the river or in distress, according to the press release."

Critics mocked Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., over his ""delivery"" of his endorsement during a rally for former President Trump on Saturday and said they were ""embarrassed"" for him.
""We need a president who understands the American people are sick and tired of being sick and tired, we need,"" Scott said as the crowd responded, ""Donald Trump.""
""Senator Tim Scott endorses Donald Trump and uh, the delivery was a choice,"" CNN reporter Omar Jimenez posted to social media. Jimenez joined ""CNN This Morning"" on Saturday and said the Trump campaign wanted to play up Scott's endorsement.
""It's quite the delivery,"" Jimenez said. ""Now, remember that Nikki Haley was the person who appointed Tim Scott to the Senate, and so this happening, of course, in the way that it did is a major blow to the former South Carolina governor. And they easily could have chosen to do this before the South Carolina primary.""

Critics responded to Jimenez' social media post, including The Nation writer Elie Mystal, who shared a GIF of Samuel L. Jackson's character Stephen from ""Djano Unchained"" and said, ""everybody saw that coming.""
Others took issue with Scott's words, where he appeared to quote civil rights activist Fanie Lou Hammer, who famously said, ""I am sick and tired of being sick and tired.""
""I hope Fannie Lou Hamer's ghost haunts him terribly for the rest of his natural life,"" Franklin Leonard, who founded The Black List, wrote on social media.
Frequent MSNBC guest and Vanity Fair correspondent Molly Jong-Fast responded to the video posted to social media and said, ""I feel embarrassed for him.""
HuffPost opinion editor Stephen Crockett Jr. likened the video to a ""WWE audition tape.""
HALEY TURNS UP THE HEAT ON TRUMP AS SHE TRIES TO CLOSE THE GAP WITH THE GOP FRONT-RUNNER
The Hollywood Reporter's Kim Masters called Scott a ""sellout.""
""We need, you see, we need a president who doesn't see Black or White. We need a president who sees Americans as one American family,"" Scott said during the New Hampshire rally. ""And that's why I came to the very warm state of New Hampshire to endorse the next president of these United States, President Donald Trump.""
Fox News Digital has reached out to Sen. Scott's office for comment.
Following the rally, Scott said in a Fox News interview that ""it's time for us to unite our party so that we make sure that the only target we're talking about is firing Joe Biden. Our country can't take four more years. I'm not sure we could take ten more months. The best way for us to get rid of Joe Biden as our president is to unite our party now behind Donald Trump.""
Scott was criticized after endorsing the former president by fellow Republicans, including New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, who has endorsed GOP candidate Nikki Haley.
""Tim Scott actually just looked in the camera and said ‘Donald Trump’s going to unite the country.’ Not even Donald Trump believes that statement,"" Sununu told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto.
""Nobody thinks Donald Trump’s united the country,"" he said.

169SXEV3JB_BHZUMUCPMK0HQ7L,Cartel human smuggling business is turning entire border towns into war zones,By Luis Chaparro Fox News,"Published January 21, 2024 12:51pm EST",20240121,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/cartel-human-smuggling-business-turning-entire-border-towns-war-zones,"Video shows Mexican national guard in shootout with cartels in Sonoyta, Sonora on Dec 29, 2023. (Video: @Michelle Rivera on X.)
CIUDAD JUÁREZ – Mexican drug cartels are making millions in profits from the hundreds of thousands of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border and are now turning entire border towns into war zones.
The money left by the migrants trying to get across the border wall from Mexico into the U.S. to criminal organizations that are charging to guide them across, extorting them or kidnapping them is creating a multimillion-dollar illegal business. Now the different criminal organizations operating across the border are fighting to death for a piece of the pie.
From small towns like Sonoyta, across the border from Lukeville, Arizona, to entire cities like Ciudad Juárez, across the river from El Paso, Texas, different cartels are killing each other and challenging Mexican authorities to gain control of the smuggling routes.
In a video from Dec. 29 shared online from Sonoyta, Sonora in northern Mexico, an SUV with several armed men around it is set on fire during a violent gunfight between alleged members of a local criminal organization with ties to the Sinaloa Cartel and the Mexican army, according to local news outlets.

The gunfight lasted for several hours, according to Sonora state authorities. The gunmen used AK-47s and AR-15s to fight authorities. After the gunfight, only five of over a dozen henchmen were captured, according to authorities.
Several videos from the same gunfight were shared online by locals where sicarios are seen firing their weapons at authorities barely managing to stay put. The main international bridge between Sonoyta and Lukeville remained closed for days after the incident, according to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) authorities.
""This last one (shooting) was probably the most publicized because the videos made it to mainstream news, but it is not the first one. This is all because of the amount of migrants arriving to this town,"" Joel Pérez, a local Sonoyta resident, told Fox News Digital.

A few weeks back, on Dec. 4, the same bridge was closed for a full day by U.S. authorities regarding a large number of migrants arriving at the border and overwhelming U.S. border authorities' capacities.
The Tucson sector, where Lukeville sits, is one of the busiest sectors on the southern border, recording over 300,000 migrant crossings in FY 2023 alone.
On Jan. 2 in the Mexican border state of Tamaulipas, 31 migrants were kidnapped by a convoy of cartel members while riding a bus heading toward the city of Matamoros, across the border from Brownsville.
The group was stopped in the middle of the night on a highway by armed men who ordered them to get off the bus and board several pickup trucks. The migrants had to pay over $2,000 each to be released, according to Mexican news outlets that obtained proof of the ransom. The group was freed 24 hours later.

A cartel member in Ciudad Juárez, across El Paso, Texas, who oversees human smuggling operations for a local criminal gang, said that over the past two years the illegal business around immigration has become ""more profitable than ever before"".
""No one wants to work on anything else right now. Everyone wants to work with the migrants because you can make a lot of money from it these days and it is easy work,"" the cartel member told Fox News Digital, at the request of remaining anonymous.
""Right now it is more profitable to smuggle migrants than to traffic bricks of cocaine, and with less risk if you get caught,"" he said.

The attorney general in Chihuahua, César Jáuregui, where Ciudad Juárez is located, also said the city is ""[experiencing] a spike in homicides"" as a direct consequence of the number of migrants arriving to the city and the illegal business around them.
""Criminals are finding a profitable business in migrants and abusing them to bleed more money from them, and this is increasing as more large numbers [of migrants] keep arriving in the city or transiting along the state,"" Jáuregui said.

Overall the U.S.-Mexico border had record-setting numbers during 2023 for migrant apprehensions, with more than 225,000 in the first 27 days of December, according to U.S. Border Patrol statistics.
""It is cruel that we have to go to criminals to help us navigate through the border or get killed, we come running from very similar situations in our countries, only to find more of that here in Mexico,"" Alfonso Robles, a Venezuelan migrant in Ciudad Juárez told Fox News Digital.
Robles left Venezuela after a local gang began extorting his small business, threatening to kill him. He traveled from Venezuela to the U.S.-Mexico border along with his wife and his 7-year-old daughter.
""As soon as we entered Mexico they started to extort us, or try to kidnap us. Right now we don’t know what else to do because the (U.S.) government is not allowing us to get into the United States and wait there, but here, it's only a question of time before a criminal group finds us and takes us,"" Robles said.

The same cartel member in Ciudad Juárez confirmed that two gangs, one affiliated with the Juarez cartel and another with Sinaloa Cartel, are fighting for the human smuggling business, and that the turf war has extended to U.S. border cities.
""This business is not only on this (Mexican) side of the border, it is also leaving millions in the U.S. to American smugglers, so they are also fighting for this business over there,"" the smuggler said.

Former Trump attorney Joe Tacopina on Sunday said that while there may be a ""political bent"" to some of the criminal indictments that former president is facing, it is ""absolutely"" possible that he could be convicted.
Tacopina, who withdrew from Trump’s legal team last week, was asked about the likelihood of a jury convicting the former president during an appearance on MSNBC’s ""Politics Nation.""
""Is it possible? Absolutely,"" Tacopina responded. ""You have a jury of twelve who’s going to ultimately decide this.""
""Do I think there’s a political bent to some of this, the way it’s gone about?"" he questioned. ""Yes, I do. Do I think these cases are invalid cases? Look, a grand jury voted to indict. You can’t say there’s no way he’ll get convicted or no way he’ll be sentenced. You just can’t say that.""

Trump was indicted four times last year, including for alleged election interference in Georgia and in New York City for allegedly falsifying business records.
He was also indicted on multiple felony counts for the alleged improper retention of classified records from his time in the White House at his Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, Fla., and four federal charges related to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot in Washington, D.C.

A Secret Service member, who was stationed beneath the staircase, stopped the protester in his tracks and the man was promptly arrested.
As the man was being escorted out of the arena, Trump supporters booed and chanted, ""USA, USA"" at the protester.

The terrorism threat in the United Kingdom is at an ""unprecedented"" level following the start of the war between Israel and Hamas last October, a top U.K. counter-terrorism official said on Friday.

Jukes added that the Israel-Hamas war has created a new ""radicalization moment"" for Islamist extremists egged on my ""extraordinary amounts"" of online content and misinformation, according to BBC News.

""What I mean, brothers and sisters, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they do not; those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep; those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away"" (1 Cor 7:29-31).
These verses come from the First Letter of St. Paul to the Corinthians, a letter sent from St. Paul to the church in Corinth, a city in present-day Greece. The letter was written in approximately 53 A.D., says the website Bible Study Tools.
The First Letter of St. Paul to the Corinthians ""revolves around the theme of problems in Christian conduct in the church,"" according to the same source.
FAITH IN JESUS IS THE 'SMARTEST, SCARIEST, MOST THRILLING AND FULFILLING PATH ONE CAN TAKE,' SAYS TEXAS PASTOR
Paul had lived in Corinth for three years and ""was personally concerned with the Corinthians' problems, revealing a true pastor's (shepherd's) heart,"" said the same website.
""At first glance and in isolation, the commands of this passage might seem counterintuitive,"" Joshua Smith, PhD, an associate professor in the Torrey Honors College at Biola University, told Fox News Digital.

""Without sustained reflection, one would be inclined to think that Paul was asking people to abandon marital fidelity and to suppress emotion,"" he said.
PASTOR GREG LAURIE ON WHY HE IS PRO-LIFE: ‘MY LIFE WAS SAVED FROM ABORTION’
While it's consistent with Jesus' teachings to not place high esteem on possessions, ""the idea that one might take the marriage bond lightly is contradictory and the idea that one would not give expression to life’s sorrows and joys is both inhumane and impractical,"" said Smith.
Verse 31, Smith said, is the key to understanding the passage: ""The form of this world is passing away.""
""Paul invites us to view life with a clear sense of the physical world’s fundamental imperative, namely, that everything we experience in it is fleeting.""
""In other words, Paul invites us to view life with a clear sense of the physical world’s fundamental imperative, namely, that everything we experience in it is fleeting, even something as sanctimonious as marriage,"" he said.
Additionally, ""Paul is also asking us to view life from the spiritual world’s fundamental imperative — which is that Jesus will return.""

""When Paul says that ‘the time is short,’ he is referring as much to the imminence of the second coming of Christ as he is to the eventuality of the world’s passing,"" said Smith.
So Christians, Smith said, should interpret these verses as ""less about the despair and futility of earthly life and more about the security we have in a life that is everlasting.""
The verses in 1 Corinthians are actually meant to instruct people to focus on eternity, rather than the present, said Joshua Smith of California.   (iStock)

And while ""the idea of being possessed or owned by someone sounds offensive to the ear of the contemporary western thinker,"" it is different when the ""possessor"" is Jesus, said Smith.
St. Paul authored much of the New Testament. ""We are able to let go of our possessions – be they literal or figurative – because we are holding tightly to the One who possesses us,"" said Smith of Biola University about a specific Bible verse from St. Paul.  (iStock)
""We are freer than ever,"" he said.
""There is a liberty that we are afforded when the roots of our joy and peace rest in something that cannot be shaken,"" Smith said.
""The happiness of this life is but a faint call to secure the joys of the next.""
This, too, applies to ""even those things that are temporal.""
""This is because we can then accept the temporary for what is: the opportunity to rehearse for a life to come,"" he said.

Officers in California say it is ""miraculous"" that no one was hurt when a ""disoriented senior driver found his way into a closed construction area.""
California Highway Patrol Fresno posted photos of the scene on its Facebook page Wednesday, saying a man ignored cautionary signs and ended up on top of a huge mound of dirt. The law enforcement agency used the opportunity to alert people of its ""Age Well Drive Smart"" classes coming soon, which will discuss safe driving habits and when it might be time to retire from driving.
""My heart goes out to the driver,"" one Facebook user wrote in response to the CHP post. ""It's the hardest moment when they realize they should no longer be driving.""
Fatal crash rates tend to increase considerably past age 70 and peak among drivers 85 and older, Insurance Institute for Highway Safety data shared by AARP states.

Ron DeSantis suspends his 2024 presidential campaign after a disappointing Iowa performance and endorses former President Trump. (DeSantis Campaign)
MANCHESTER, N.H. — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out of the 2024 Republican presidential race and endorsed former President Trump two days before the New Hampshire primary.
The Florida governor announced his decision to suspend his campaign in a social media video on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday afternoon.
""If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it,"" DeSantis said in the video. ""But I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory.""
""Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign,"" said DeSantis, who was a distant third in the single digits in the latest polls in New Hampshire.

DeSantis highlighted that he's had ""disagreements"" with Trump but believes that the former president is a better leader than Biden.
""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,"" DeSantis continued. ""They watched his presidency get stymied by relentless resistance, and they see Democrats using lawfare this day to attack him.""
DeSantis noted that ""I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honor that pledge.""

Trump, who along with his allies spent months fiercely attacking DeSantis, told Fox News Digital's Brooke Singman that he was ""very honored to have his endorsement.""
""I look forward to working together with him to beat Joe Biden, who is the worst and most corrupt president in the history of our country,"" Trump said.

And Trump, who for months had used the derogatory nickname ""Ron DeSanctimonious"" on the campaign trail, said he wouldn't be using that nickname going forward.
""No, that name has been officially retired,"" Trump told Fox News Digital.
The Florida governor also took a chance to criticize former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, who is a former two-term South Carolina governor and the other remaining major contender for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.
TRUMP RUNNING MATE SPECULATION SOARS AS FORMER PRESIDENT CONSOLIDATES SUPPORT
DeSantis said he endorsed Trump ""because we can't go back to the old Republican Guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.""
""The days of putting Americans last, of kowtowing to large corporations, of caving to woke ideology are over,"" he added.

Haley, speaking at a campaign stop in Seabrook, New Hampshire, told the crowd, ""I want to say to Ron, he ran a great race. He’s been a good governor. And we wish him well. Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left.""
And in a statement, Haley noted that ""so far, only one state has voted. Half of its votes went to Donald Trump, and half did not. We’re not a country of coronations. Voters deserve a say in whether we go down the road of Trump and Biden again, or we go down a new conservative road. New Hampshire voters will have their say on Tuesday. When I’m president, I will do everything in my power to show them they made the right decision.""
A signal that the end was near came on Saturday night when DeSantis canceled two major Sunday talk show appearances. His campaign said at the time that the interviews were canceled to allow the governor to travel back to New Hampshire from South Carolina, where he was stumping on Saturday.
The DeSantis video was posted on Sunday afternoon, a couple of hours before the governor was scheduled to hold a campaign event in Manchester, New Hampshire. That stop was canceled and there was no word on whether DeSantis would fly to New Hampshire to join Trump ahead of Tuesday's primary.
DeSantis, 45, finished in second place in last week's Iowa caucuses with 20.1% of the vote, but he only narrowly defeated Haley and came in 30 points behind Trump, who achieved a record-breaking and commanding victory in the low-turnout Hawkeye State contest.
DeSantis' departure from the race comes after his campaign went ""all in"" on Iowa, betting that a strong ground game, events, visits to all 99 counties and endorsements from top Iowa Republicans would propel him to a strong showing leading into elections in New Hampshire and South Carolina.
But his distant second-place finish, while it slightly exceeded expectations in the final polls, was seen as a major disappointment, considering all the time and resources he spent in Iowa.

The Democratic National Committee, taking aim at the Florida governor, charged that ""Ron DeSantis pinned his entire campaign’s hopes on the same extreme MAGA agenda that both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley are still running on, and now he is the latest member of the GOP to fall in line behind the original MAGA brand.""

DeSantis, who was convincingly re-elected to a second term as Florida governor 14 months ago, was once the clear alternative to Trump in the Republican White House race. Multiple polls showed DeSantis leading Trump early last year before he entered the race, but he faltered out of the gate with a glitch-riddled social media campaign announcement.
The governor was backed by the big-spending aligned super PAC Never Back Down. However, after a series of campaign setbacks over the summer and autumn, and after getting hammered by constant attacks and negative ads from Trump and his allies, DeSantis saw his support in the polls erode.
Dan Eberhart, a top DeSantis donor, bundler and surrogate, told Fox News Digital that ""Ron DeSantis ran into a bump and the bump was named Trump.""
""This wasn’t about money. The campaign insists they had enough money to get to Super Tuesday. I think this was about data and polling and Gov. DeSantis being realistic about whether or not Trump was beatable,"" Eberhart said.
And he added that ""more importantly, I think this was about 2028, and DeSantis doesn’t want [a] 5 to 8% showing in New Hampshire on his record. Let’s face it, he’s the Republican voters' de facto second choice, and he’s Trump voters’ second choice, and so he’s decided to get out and govern Florida.""

Now, he is fighting to protect others from the same fate.
Stephen Lara was driving cross-country to see his daughters in California when a seemingly routine traffic stop ended with the Nevada Highway Patrol seizing his entire life savings of $87,000.
""I knew at that moment that wasn't the place to fight this battle,"" Lara, a 42-year-old Marine veteran, told Fox News. ""I had to stay calm.""
It took Lara seven months to get his money back from the government, but his fight to prevent law enforcement agencies from getting kickbacks for seizing suspected but untried Americans' property remains ongoing.
After nearly three years, a new ruling denying Nevada's motion to dismiss his case brought new life to Lara's battle for vindication.
""This is absolutely atrocious for our county, local, state and federal governments to be colluding with each other on taking assets from the very people that they're supposed to be serving,"" Lara said. ""I've already got my money back, but that does not solve the problem.""
""I fully intend on seeing this through until we succeed and we're victorious,"" he added.

Lara left the Marine Corps in 2016 after 16 years of service, which included tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. During the pandemic, Lara moved in with his elderly parents in Lubbock, Texas, but drove for four days each month to see his two teenage daughters who lived with his ex-wife in a small California town outside Reno, Nevada.
In February 2021, he had about an hour left on his drive when the Nevada Highway Patrol pulled Lara over, saying he drove too close to a vehicle in front of him, body camera footage showed.
The officer is seen applauding Lara on his safe driving before asking him to step out of his vehicle and start questioning him.
""He pulled me over for driving too close to a truck and the next thing you know, I'm being pulled out of the car, and they're going through my personal belongings and asking me a ton of questions — if I had any bodies in the car or any drugs, any anything illegal,"" Lara said. ""And I'm thinking to myself, ‘What is going on here?’""
THE FBI TOOK HER LIFE SAVINGS. NOW SHE’S FIGHTING TO HELP OTHERS GET THEIRS BACK
Lara told the police he had money in his car, telling them ""I don’t trust banks, so I keep my own money."" He let them search his vehicle where they found the $87,000 along with bank receipts and paystubs.
After further questioning and searching, the police told Lara a drug-sniffing dog detected something on the cash, and they suspected it was tied to drug crimes. Officers informed Lara they were seizing his money and handing it over to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) using civil asset forfeiture, which allows the government to seize and keep property it suspects is connected to criminal activity.
Lara said he felt ""a combination of confusion and anger"" as the situation escalated, ""but at the same time, I knew I had to stay calm and collected.""
The FBI has said forfeiture is an important tool for ""disrupting and dismantling criminal and terrorist organizations and punishing criminals"" as well as ""compensating victims and protecting communities.""
""Forfeiture can also serve as a deterrent to others who might be considering criminal activities,"" the FBI wrote in 2017.

'LEGAL THEFT': TEXAS POLICE SEIZED MAN'S LIFE SAVINGS. NOW THE STATE IS PUTTING HIS CASH ON TRIAL
While Nevada is one of many states that have limitations on civil forfeiture, requiring clear and convincing evidence that property is connected to a crime for it to be forfeited to the government, a program called ""equitable sharing"" allows state and local law enforcement to partner with federal agencies on forfeitures.
In those instances, restrictions can be evaded. After federal officials seize the property, they can return up to 80% of the proceeds to the state agency.
About an hour after being pulled over, Lara’s entire life savings were taken from him. He was left on the side of the road without enough money to pay for gas. He was not charged with a crime.
""I'm thinking, these guys couldn't have pulled over a worse person because I'm not going to back down from this,"" Lara told Fox News. ""I knew I was going to get my money back. It was just a matter of how.""
HOW THE GOVERNMENT USES A ‘LEGAL MAZE’ TO ‘WAGE WAR’ ON AMERICANS’ PROPERTY, ACCORDING TO THIS ATTORNEY
The DEA missed deadlines required by state law to either charge Lara with a crime, begin a civil forfeiture case against his property or return the money within six months of seizure.
After six months, Lara teamed up with the Institute for Justice and sued the Nevada Highway Patrol over the seizure and filed a court motion asking the DEA to give him his money back. The DEA agreed to return Lara’s money the following day, according to the Institute for Justice.
""Steven lost his life savings for the better part of a year while the government simply held on to it, and he had to file a lawsuit to get it back since they didn't have any evidence of a crime,"" Institute for Justice attorney Ben Field told Fox News. ""But for most people, they just don't have the resources to do that.""
""The government relies on people not asserting their constitutional rights so that it can keep the money,"" he added.
Lara maintained his lawsuit against the Nevada Highway Patrol, arguing his rights under the Nevada Constitution were violated, and is seeking compensation for damages, a declaration that the seizure lacked probable cause and a restraining order barring the NHP’s use of equitable sharing.
""Mr. Lara wants a declaration from the court saying that Nevada law enforcement has to respect the Nevada Constitution, and they can't go around the protections of Nevada law simply by giving the money over to the federal government,"" Field said.

The case was stayed in March after the state filed a motion to dismiss, but last Thursday, the Second Judicial District Court for the State of Nevada denied the motion.
""The government was arguing there's simply no way for somebody like Mr. Lara to seek to vindicate his rights in court,"" Field said. ""And the court said, ‘No, that's wrong.’""
Lara said he ""fully expects to succeed"" as the case resumes and moves toward a trial, but as a result of this experience he has ""lost full faith and confidence in law enforcement,""
""It was the very government I would have laid my life down for that was trying to take my money,"" he told Fox News. ""They tried to take my livelihood away from my children and I, and that does something to you.""
Neither the DEA nor the Nevada Highway Patrol returned requests for comment.

A Texas man pleaded guilty to kidnapping a 13-year-old girl who was rescued in California after an observant passerby saw her hold up a ""Help Me!"" sign in a parked car.
According to a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Central District of California, Steven Robert Sablan, 62, of Cleburne, Texas, pled guilty.
The 62-year-old admitted that he had sexually assaulted the 13-year-old girl after kidnapping her.

An educational network backed by one of the nation's largest teachers' unions came under fire from a school choice advocate after they labeled voucher programs as racist in a campaign slated to push back against ""National School Choice Week.""
""Families aren't going to be silenced into submission,"" Corey DeAngelis, a self-described school choice evangelist, said Sunday on ""Fox & Friends Weekend.""
""They're going to be emboldened to push back even harder, and the momentum is going to continue in 2024. We have states like Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Georgia. They're all on deck to expand school choice even further. This attack from the teachers unions just reeks of desperation. They've hit rock bottom. They're grasping at straws to do whatever they can to try to trap other people's kids in their failing government schools. That's not going to work anymore. Families are fed up.""

Corey DeAngelis, a self-described ""school choice evangelist,"" criticized the campaign during an appearance on ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" on Sunday. (iStock/Fox & Friends Weekend split)
The campaign, according to a QuickStart Guide from Partnership for the Future of Learning, aims to challenge rhetoric claiming that school choice programs ""advance equity.""
""One way they can do this is to challenge the narrative head-on by taking care to explain how voucher programs can disadvantage students of color and deepen existing inequities,"" the guide reads in part.
The guide continues with the rationale that school choice takes funding away from high-quality public education that ""ensures that every student has an equal chance in life, regardless of race or where they live.""
""School choice initiatives, like voucher programs, make this vision difficult to achieve. These programs take money from the public school system to pay tuition at private schools. This is more likely to take place in Black and Brown communities, which are underfunded to start, and forces them to cut corners and increase class size. The end result is that neighborhood public schools, and the communities that depend on them, are deprived of important resources that students need to learn and succeed.""
TEACHERS UNION BOSS RANDI WEINGARTEN CLAIMS SCHOOL CHOICE ‘UNDERMINES DEMOCRACY’
The Partnership for the Future of Learning cited vouchers as having roots in the Civil Rights movement, allegedly as a way of allowing white students to avoid desegregation. (iStock)
A network website, which contains talking points defending public education, writes that voucher programs were rooted in segregation, writing that ""publicly funded scholarships to attend private schools were intended for white families to escape state desegregation efforts,"" adding that voucher programs increase racial isolation.
DeAngelis, conversely, argued Sunday that school choice is beneficial for students and families of all groups.
""There are 29 studies on this on the subject of school choice competition. Twenty-six of the 29 studies find positive effect,"" he said.
""School choice is a rising tide that lifts all boats. The public schools actually up their game in response to competition and obviously getting more of a choice. Your kids are going to be better off because parents know their kids better than anybody, certainly more than bureaucrats sitting in offices hundreds of miles away. So you get an opportunity. Your kids are going to be better off on academics, but also just choosing a school that aligns with your values.""
SCHOOL CHOICE GIVES PARENTS THE POWER TO BREAK TEACHERS UNIONS' CHOKEHOLDS ON STUDENTS: COREY DEANGELIS
""Parents don't want to send their kids to institutions where they feel like they're being brainwashed for 13 years.""
DeAngelis posted about the Partnership for the Future of Learning's initiative on X last Thursday, saying it begins Monday.
He also attached images containing information about the toolkit and the alleged dangers of allowing school voucher programs to grow.
""Fox & Friends Weekend"" reached out to both the Partnership for the Future of Learning and the National Education Association, which is listed as one of the network's ""partnering organizations"" online, but did not receive a response in time for the segment.

DN9APSGB9E_MI3CBTLL5G8JWKD,MSNBC contributor claims mainstream media tried to make Trump seem 'not so bad': 'Cleaned up' his rhetoric,By Hanna Panreck Fox News,"Published January 21, 2024 10:35am EST",20240121,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-contributor-claims-mainstream-media-tried-make-trump-seem-not-so-bad-cleaned-up-his-rhetoric,"MSNBC's Jennifer Rubin claimed on Saturday that the mainstream media ""normalized"" Donald Trump by cleaning up his rhetoric and making him seem ""not so bad.""
MSNBC contributor Jennifer Rubin said Saturday that the mainstream media tried to make Donald Trump seem ""not so bad,"" and claimed the media ""cleaned up"" his rhetoric to normalize him.
Rubin, a Washington Post columnist, responded to MSNBC host Ali Velshi, who said ""people don’t even want to watch clips of Donald Trump on our shows,"" citing feedback they received. Velshi added that Trump has been treated as a ""quirky abstraction,"" rather than a threat to democracy.
""Well, I think two things are going on. One, this speaks to how badly the mainstream media has covered him. They have normalized him, they have cleaned up the rhetoric so he sounds in a clip or he reads in print much more coherent than he actually is. It’s only very recently that the mainstream media has been reporting on his really shocking totalitarian claims. But of course, he’s been this way all along,"" Rubin said.
""And I think because they have done such a bad job, because they have made an effort to treat the Republican Party like the Democratic Party, this notion that he’s not so bad, that he’s just kind of a cartoon character has set in. And that’s on the mainstream media, that’s on the failure to be honest and to side with truth rather than having this false balance,"" she continued.

MADDOW DERIDED FOR REFUSING TO AIR TRUMP'S ‘UNTRUTHS’ AFTER VIDEO OF HER DEBUNKED CLAIMS GOES VIRAL
Rubin also said Trump's supporters were part of a ""fascist cult.""
""Let's be honest, there are a lot of them, but a lot of them does not mean that they are behaving logically or rationally. To the contrary, we’ve seen in other fascist regimes, that millions of people, sometimes even a majority of the country, becomes intoxicated with an authoritarian figure, and these people are utterly irrational,"" she continued.
MSNBC's Rachel Maddow told viewers that they would not air Trump's speech after he was projected to win the Iowa caucuses.
""The reason I’m saying this is, of course, there is a reason that we and other news organizations have generally stopped giving an unfiltered, live platform to remarks by former President Trump,"" Maddow said. ""It is not out of spite, it is not a decision that we relish, it is a decision that we regularly revisit. And honestly, earnestly, it is not an easy decision.""

She went on to claim that airing Trump's ""untrue"" statements live on television hurts MSNBC's brand.
""But there is a cost to us, as a news organization,"" Maddow said, ""of knowingly broadcasting untrue things. That is a fundamental truth of our business and who we are. And so, his remarks, tonight, will not air here live. We will monitor them and let you know about any news that he makes.""

He added: ""It is a tremendous thing and a tremendous feeling.""

Ron DeSantis joins ‘Your World’ to discuss the battle for New Hampshire.
Former President Trump joked about Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ""short circuit[ing]"" during a tense interview on ""Your World"" Friday.
""Ron DeSanctimonious short circuits when confronted with the fact he didn’t win a single county in Iowa,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.
The former president posted an interview that Fox News host Neil Cavuto conducted with DeSantis.

""You look at Iowa. Um, you know, we did it, right?"" DeSantis said during the program. ""I mean, we got the endorsement of the governor. We won the debates, the Miami debate, the Newsom debate, the NewsNation debate, the CNN debate. We did televised town halls, you know, got a great response.""

""But I also had, I mean, you know, how many people would have been able to handle $50 million in ads?"" DeSantis fired back. ""How many people would have been able to handle all the headwinds we did? I mean, we had a very uphill battle.""
""We dug in and we executed, and we did run hard. We did do well,"" he added.
On Saturday, DeSantis abruptly canceled two Sunday appearances planned for NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" and CNN’s ""State of the Union"" with Jake Tapper, and is headed to New Hampshire for Tuesday's presidential primary.

JD Vance, R-Ohio, joins ‘Fox News Sunday’ to weigh in on the new poll revealing that Trump is leading Haley by 19% in New Hampshire.
Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance argued 2024 presidential candidate Nikki Haley would likely be unable to survive Democratic attacks if elected the party's nominee, saying she's ""the candidate that Democrats haven't teed off on.""
""Nikki does have baggage. She just hasn't faced the onslaught of years of media attacks, of super PAC attacks that Donald Trump has faced. And frankly, the fact that Trump is still standing and still leading in the polls against Joe Biden suggests he has real political resilience,"" Vance told Fox News' Shannon Bream on ""Fox News Sunday.""
Bream aired a clip of her asking New Hampshire voters who they supported ahead of the Granite State's primary on Tuesday, with one woman explaining she's voting for Haley because she has ""no baggage."" Vance, who is serving as a surrogate for the Trump campaign, pushed back that Haley does have ""baggage,"" but Democrats have not attacked her, as they have Trump, in recent years.

""I know a lot of people who are choosing Nikki Haley think she's the low baggage candidate. In reality, she's the candidate that Democrats haven't teed off on, but they will tee off on her if she's the nominee,"" Vance said, adding that Haley ""won't be"" the nominee.
TRUMP MAINTAINS MASSIVE LEAD IN NEW HAMPSHIRE DAYS AHEAD OF FIRST PRIMARY: POLL
""But if she is [the nominee], she will face exactly what Donald Trump has faced for the past six years, and I don't think she'll survive, and I certainly don't think she'll win the presidency through it. That's why we need to elect the guy who's shown some resilience. That's why we need to nominate Donald Trump,"" he said.
Trump solidified himself as the Republican frontrunner for 2024 last week, when he handily won the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses. He is now focusing on the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday.

While some polls, such as one published by American Research Group Inc., showed Haley and Trump tied for support, others have shown Trump with a stronger advantage over the former South Carolina governor.

Trump has 55% support among those likely to vote in the primary, compared to Haley's 36% support and DeSantis' 6% support, a Suffolk University, the Boston Globe and NBC10 poll found.
Bream cited the Suffolk poll, as well as a CNN poll that found Trump has 50% support to Haley's 39%, and noted to Vance that many voters in New Hampshire are undeclared, but vote in the GOP primary.
TRUMP SAYS NIKKI HALEY 'HAS NO CHANCE' AHEAD OF NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY: 'MAGA IS NOT GOING TO BE WITH HER'
""There are a couple of newspaper editorials today endorsing Nikki Haley, telling people if you're independent get out, ‘save the country and vote in that GOP primary.’ I mean, that's a substantial group of people here. How concerned are you about them showing up and not choosing President Trump on Tuesday?"" Bream asked.

Vance responded that liberals who recently moved out of Massachusetts to New Hampshire would ""never"" vote for a Republican nominee – whether they be Trump or Haley - and are instead ""trying to play spoiler to Donald Trump"" and his primary race.
""I think a lot of them are going to vote for Donald Trump and also liberal… many of them from Massachusetts who are moving to New Hampshire, they're never going to vote for a Republican nominee, even if it's Nikki Haley,"" Vance said.

""They're just trying to play spoiler to Donald Trump. But I think Republicans really have to ask ourselves, do we want liberal suburbanites from Massachusetts to choose our nominee? Or do we want to choose our nominee as Republicans and independent-minded conservatives? I think if we choose our nominee, Donald Trump is going to win, and he's going to win handily,"" Vance added.

GAAPDMMSLL_VX8YCQIFFVATA3L,'Sense of hopelessness': Michael McCaul sounds alarm on border patrol mental health crisis,By Elizabeth Elkind Fox News,"Published January 21, 2024 5:17pm EST",20240121,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michael-mccaul-sounds-alarm-on-border-patrol-mental-health-crisis,"House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul sat down with Fox News Digital in McAllen, Texas, a city on the U.S.-Mexico border, to discuss the migrant crisis. He led a bipartisan congressional delegation to the border over the weekend.
MCALLEN, Texas — House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Mike McCaul said he’s ""profoundly"" alarmed at the impact the ongoing border crisis is having on Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents’ mental health.
The senior Republican spoke to Fox News Digital in the border city of McAllen, Texas, a bipartisan congressional delegation met with border and immigration officials while also touring facilities where migrants are brought and their asylum claims processed.
McCaul said the state of the border is ""just worse"" each time he’s seen it.
""Every time I come down here, it gets worse; the lack of detention space, the human tragedy you see here; what the Border Patrol has to deal with every day, day in and day out, looking at these migrants that are pouring in; this sense of hopelessness, that it won't stop,"" the Texas Republican said.

""Profoundly, I worry about the mental health of our border patrol. The suicide rate is going up. They don't have the proper resources.""
Seventeen CBP agents died by suicide in 2022 alone, Chris Cabrera, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, told Congress in March 2023. That’s the highest number since CBP began tracking it in 2007. There were 19,357 CPB agents on the job in 2022.
Since then, the number of migrant encounters at the border has continued to see historic highs, most recently this past December, while CBP has struggled somewhat to replenish its retiring forces.

McCaul said the cartels on the other side of the border that are bringing a constant flow of drug and human trafficking are better equipped, in some ways, than the federal officials patrolling on the U.S. side.
""For instance, we only have 20 drones here in the Rio Grande Valley sector, and the cartels are way out numbering us. And that's just eyes and ears on the ground,"" McCaul said. ""So, we're not equipping them. But most importantly, more than money, is just the lack of policy.""
Cabrera spoke to the media during his recent border visit, describing what he said were regular instances of officers getting overwhelmed.

""There’s times when you’re out there, two, three agents, and you’ll have 100 people there,"" he said.
""But then you also have the medical emergencies: pregnant women, dehydration, kids with illnesses, people that have broken legs along the journey. And then we have people that fall off the wall. So, while we’re dealing with two, three hundred people, or 50 people, you’re also having to deal with medical emergencies and issues like that.""

GOHP7AP0P9_RYARSSBM8MADAB1,Squatter pirates in Florida setting up homes on abandoned boats,By Emma Colton Fox News,"Published January 21, 2024 4:00am EST",20240121,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/squatter-pirates-florida-setting-homes-abandoned-boats,"A suspected squatter who was allegedly illegally living in a Florida home and using the owner’s car was spotted on video staking out other homes before his arrest, video obtained by Fox News Digital shows.
Squatters in Florida are increasingly moving into derelict boats dumped along the coast, according to authorities working to clear the boats and squatters.
""We’ve seen a tremendous increase, actually, throughout the county,"" Martin County Sheriff’s Office Lt. Michael Dougherty told local media last week. ""You’ll have vagrants squatting on the boat, it falling apart, there have been several instances where the boats have come loose and ran into the docks.""
The Martin County Sheriff’s Office says it has long dealt with derelict boats left to rot along the Florida coast, but now, authorities say homeless individuals are increasingly taking up residence on the boats. The county is situated along Florida’s southeastern coast and includes cities such as Jupiter Island and Jensen Beach.
Authorities cite cost of living issues for the increase of squatters and homeless people moving onto the boats. Derelict boats are defined as vessels found in waterways with at least two violations, which can range from having not motor to leaking fuel. Dumping derelict boats is a state crime that could lead to jail time or fines.

County commissioners recently amended an ordinance that gives more power to law enforcement and the harbormaster to remove such boats. Boats ruled derelict can now be tagged by authorities, who then contact the boat’s owner, NBC Miami reported. If no action is taken in 21 days, authorities can dispose of the boat - which comes at a big cost for taxpayers.
""It can be anywhere from $6,000 and upwards,"" Dougherty told the outlet. ""Astronomical amounts of money.""
The boats and squatters have also had negative impacts on businesses that rely on showing tourists Florida’s waterways and beaches.

""This time of year is our busiest … with the snowbirds making their way down,""Giles Murphy, who owns Stuart Angler Bait & Tackle, told WPTV. ""A lot of them are seeing these derelict boats and being like, 'What's up with these boats?' It's a real eyesore. The attraction of our waters to anglers to get out there and fish, and tourists and stuff, I mean, we need to keep it looking good.""

In addition to the derelict boats, the sheriff’s office has recently been dealing with abandoned boats that appear to have transported migrants to the U.S.
Florida, similar to other states across the nation, has been dealing with repeated instances of squatters moving into abandoned homes or forging documents to make it appear they own a home.
SQUATTER SPOTTED CRUISING IN HOMEOWNER'S CAR AFTER SETTING UP GAME ROOM
Roughly 160 miles up the coast from Martin County, squatters took over an area located near the Dunlawton Bridge in Port Orange, dubbed by social media commenters as ""Meth Island."" Squatters built makeshift wooden structures, including an elaborate four-story tree house, and other huts made out of what appeared to be old lumber and tree branches.

They also installed a trampoline and appeared to be in the middle of constructing a pool on the island, footage of the scene published by authorities showed. To deter visitors, the squatters even allegedly outfitted the island with booby traps.

The Biden administration’s policy of trying to play friendly with China has yielded few material gains, and the U.S. has failed to capitalize upon what little concessions it has gotten, experts told Fox News Digital.
""The one thing that we've got is time,"" Gordon Chang, Gatestone Institute senior fellow and China expert, explained. ""The United States is not ready to defend itself and its allies and partners, and by appeasing China we have bought a little bit of time.""
""Biden has bought time, and the Pentagon has done nothing. It hasn’t done as much as it’s needed to do, so we have wasted time. … Apart from that, I don’t think we’ve gotten very much.""
""Clearly, the United States is no longer deterring China as we once did, so this is the time to change a policy that has worked but is no longer sufficient in today’s setting.""

President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2022 held their first face-to-face meeting since Biden took office while attending the G-20 summit in Indonesia. Last year, Xi visited the U.S. for the first time since 2018 and met with Biden in San Francisco on the sidelines of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference.
Xi and Biden agreed to military-to-military communications and aggressively tackle the manufacture and distribution of fentanyl, which largely originates in China and Mexico. Nearly all ""precursor chemicals"" needed to produce fentanyl originate in China, according to The Associated Press.
Last week, Biden National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos about the administration's progress with China.
""The United States is competing with China across multiple dimensions, and we make no bones about that. But we are not looking for confrontation or conflict. And we are seeking to manage that competition responsibly, intensifying diplomacy to reduce the risk of miscalculation,"" Sullivan said.
Sullivan also highlighted the recent meeting between the two leaders and noted the resumption of military-to-military communications, claiming the move was ""good for our relationship but also for regional and global stability. It will help reduce the risk of unintended conflict.""

Yet critics like Chang harbor major criticism of the Biden administration for not taking action in response to the many deaths from COVID-19 and fentanyl, both originating in China. Over 1.1 million Americans died from the pandemic, according to numbers published in April 2023, and over 73,000 Americans died from fentanyl overdoses in the U.S. in 2022.

""To me, it's incomprehensible that we would allow this, but we have allowed the killing of Americans in great numbers,"" Chang said.
Critics and analysts had also expected stronger action from Biden following a tumultuous year for China-U.S. relations. The U.S. caught China sending spy crafts into sovereign American airspace, and China increased its incursions into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ).

The Biden administration instead has spent time ramping up military drills with regional allies and strengthening ties with partners like Australia, Singapore, South Korea and Japan.
Japan this week agreed to buy 400 U.S.-made long-range Tomahawk missiles, just one day after holding a massive naval drill with both the U.S. and South Korea in a show of force against North Korea. But China will have paid attention to such a demonstration.

Matt McInnis, senior fellow for the Institute for the Study of War’s China program, told Fox News Digital he would hesitate to label the Biden administration’s total approach to China as one of appeasement, but he argued that the White House does show ""too much concern about provoking China.""
""The Biden administration has continued many of the policies of the Trump administration on China and is actually taking some strong steps in many areas with China, but I do think that inherent fear of provocation is setting us up — especially this year — for some concessions that are going to be detrimental.""

In addition to the spy balloon incident and a lack of significant U.S. response, the U.S. has not managed to convince China to curb North Korea, which continues to make greater and greater shows of force as the hermit kingdom’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un seeks to establish his country as a legitimate world power.
Chang argued that the soft touch with China has allowed the international system to break down as ""bad actors now feel they can do what they want."" He cited the escalating tensions last week between Iran and Pakistan as an example.
CHINA'S POPULATION FALLS AGAIN AS RECORD-LOW BIRTHS POSE ECONOMIC STRAINS
Chang criticized the Biden administration’s policy of ""strategic ambiguity,"" which administration spokespeople have cited in a variety of responses regarding America’s approach to China.
""Strategic ambiguity"" sees America oscillating between clear support for the One China Policy, which necessitates opposition to Taiwan’s independence, even as the Pentagon continues to arm Taiwan and prepare it for possible invasion.

Both China and North Korea have provided backdoor support for Russia, with North Korea providing basic munitions in a bid to obtain more advanced weapons from Moscow. China reiterated support for Russia after the failed Wagner mercenary rebellion against the Russian Ministry of Defense over disagreements regarding progress in Ukraine.

China has also only emboldened Iran, which has continued to push its proxies in the Middle East and fund their attacks against American military assets and allies in the region.
While the Iran-backed Houthis double down on their attacks against international commercial ships in the Red Sea, China looks to fold Iran into the BRICS economic bloc and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.

HR3TPPPIMD_RY5WY2RFQMC3KTC,LeVar Burton shocked to discover he's descended from a Confederate soldier,By Kristine Parks Fox News,"Published January 21, 2024 6:00am EST",20240121,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/media/levar-burton-shocked-discover-descended-confederate-soldier,"Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., claimed a White man at the Capitol tried to prevent her from entering the congressional elevator and accused her of stealing her pin.
Actor LeVar Burton was in disbelief after learning he descended from a White Confederate soldier on Tuesday's episode of ""Finding Your Roots.""
The PBS documentary show uses written ancestries and DNA research to discover the long-lost family histories of prominent guests.
Show host and Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. revealed to Burton that his family had harbored a deep secret for generations. The man he thought was his great-great-grandfather was not actually genetically matched to him. His great-grandmother, Mary Sills, was actually descended from a White man named James Henry Dixon.
""Were you expecting that? Did you have any idea you had a White, direct ancestor?"" host Gates asked Burton.

Burton was in disbelief at this discovery. ""No! No, I had no idea. So Granny was half-White! Wow,"" he reacted.
Further research into Burton's lineage revealed even more surprising discoveries. His ancestor was born in North Carolina in 1847 and served in the reserve troops in the Confederate army as a teenager. Later on, he fathered a child with an African-American woman born into slavery.
""Are you kidding me? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I did not see this coming,"" Burton admitted.
Burton, who famously portrayed a slave in the 1977 TV miniseries, ""Roots,"" was floored to find out his great-great grandfather fought to protect the institution of slavery during America's Civil War.
He pondered aloud about his great-great-grandparents' relationship.

""I often wonder about White men of the period and how they justify to themselves their relations with Black women, especially those in an unbalanced power dynamic. There has to be a powerful disconnect created emotionally and mentally,"" Burton considered.
""So it’s possible in my mind that he could’ve contemplated it and was conflicted at worst, maybe repentant at best. And then there’s the possibility that he didn’t think about it at all,"" he added.
After seeing a photo of his great-great grandfather, Burton joked he would've ""fought"" Gates if he had told him he had White ancestry before being presented with the evidence.
Referring to his ""Roots"" character's name, he joked, ""What? Kunta got White ancestry? What? Come on now, Skip,"" he said, referring to Gates by his nickname.

Based on Alex Haley's best-selling novel, ""Roots"" followed 100 tumultuous years and several generations of the author's African ancestors, from the arrival of Kunta Kinte (LeVar Burton, right), the West African youth kidnapped into slavery and shipped to America, through emancipation after the Civil War. (Getty Images)
While reflecting on these discoveries, Burton confessed, ""There’s some conflict roiling inside of me right now, but also oddly enough, I feel a pathway opening up.""
He said he wanted to have a ""conversation"" with Americans about how our history with slavery has led to the current moment but felt he couldn't because of political and racial polarization.
""So I've been looking for an entry point to talk to White America,"" he said. ""Here it is.""
After the initial shock, Burton said he was surprised but is ""embracing"" all of his family history.

Germany’s right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party was met with massive crowds of protesters Saturday, after a report revealed it had discussed deporting millions of immigrants, including German citizens, late last year.
Investigative journalism group Correctiv published a report Wednesday on the meeting between AfD and the Identitarian Movement (IM) in November, claiming IM member Martin Sellner presented a plan for ""re-migration"" of immigrants out of Germany, including those who already have citizenship, but have failed to integrate.
AfD has confirmed the meeting, which was allegedly captured on hidden cameras, took place but rejected assertions that it reflects their party policy.
""The AfD won't change its position on immigration policy because of a single opinion at a non-AfD meeting,"" a spokesperson told Reuters.

Protesters across Germany held signs on Saturday that read ""Never Again is Now,"" ""Defend Democracy"" and ""Against Hate"" as the meeting garners comparisons with the Nazis.
A protest in Frankfurt on Saturday had around 35,000 people and one in Hamburg had around 50,000, police said. Others took place in cities like Stuttgart, Nuremberg and Hannover.
Hamburg’s demonstration ended early over crowd size safety concerns.

Large protests in cities like Berlin and Munich are also planned for Sunday.
The report and subsequent protests have also renewed calls for a ban on the AfD in the country.

The AfD was founded in 2013 and polling suggests it has around 23% support in the country.
AfD was the first right-wing party since the Nazis to win a mayoral and district council election when it did last year. It has also made significant gains in state elections in Bavaria and Hesse.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz condemned the AfD and Identarian Movement in a statement on social media last week, comparing them to the Third Reich.
""We protect everyone — regardless of origin, skin color or how uncomfortable someone is for fanatics with assimilation fantasies,"" said Scholz.

A former U.S. attorney suggested on Friday that Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney Fani Willis is likely conceding some allegations levied against her are true after she used race to defend a colleague she is accused of having an inappropriate relationship with.
""We've seen now it's an attack on the people who were questioning or raised the issue for further investigation, and I think that sounds a lot to me like maybe a concession that some of the allegations in the motion must be true,"" Michael Moore said of Willis' recent remarks on CNN, where he serves as an analyst.
Court documents filed earlier this month say Willis hired special prosecutor Nathan Wade, her alleged romantic partner, to prosecute former President Trump in Georgia's election interference case and benefited financially from the relationship in the form of lavish vacations that the two went on using funds his firm received for working the case.
Willis was recently subpoenaed to appear in court as part of Wade's divorce case. A new filing from her attorney claims Wade's estranged wife conspired with interested parties to ""annoy, embarrass,"" and ""oppress"" Willis.
""Because the parties agree their marriage is irretrievably broken, there is no information that Willis could provide that would be relevant,"" the filing said in part.

Moore, a Democrat who was appointed by President Obama in 2010 and served until 2015, told CNN that while he does not think the allegations on their own will be ""completely destructive"" to the case against Trump, it is a ""real optics problem"" for Willis.
He noted that it is more likely the judge will make ""short work"" of the issue and will likely ask Willis to state if the allegations are accurate.
""I think the question is whether or not she hired somebody who was not experienced, does he, in fact, have a felony prosecution background to be handling this type and this magnitude of a case,"" he said.
Moore was then asked whether Willis could be prosecuted for honest services fraud and the federal racketeering statute after Wade was allegedly paid around $650,000 so far in the case.
He said that he thinks any prosecution of Willis would be ""far down the road"" but took particular issue with claims that she paid Wade 10 times as much as she paid another special assistant. Moore stressed that these disparities would have to be explained.
""No judge wants the courtroom to become a circus. The problem with these kinds of allegations is it has a tendency to make a case a circus as opposed to the facts of the case,"" he said.

Willis on Sunday appeared to use race to defend Wade during a speech in an Atlanta church, saying, ""All three of these special counselors are superstars. But I'm just asking god, is it that some will never see a Black man as qualified no matter his achievements? What more can one achieve? The other two have never been judges. But no one questions their credentials.""
Moore said he does not believe her comments are helpful in getting her motion passed to squash the subpoena.
""To see in a case like this where she makes the allegations, he's been questioned because he may be an African American male, it misses the mark. I don't think you can use race as a sword to attack somebody, clearly, nor do I think you can use it as a shield to hide behind to say, simply because you may be African American, that your activities are beyond any inquiry, especially when these allegations are made. I think that's the line she's crossed,"" he said.
Moore added that her ""attack"" made it more likely that some of the allegations may be true.
Moore previously said that Willis should step away from the case amid the allegations. He suggested that if they are true, they would challenge the integrity of the proceedings.
""Cases are not lost because of some 'Matlock' moment, some moment like you see in 'My Cousin Vinny,' where suddenly somebody finds the evidence. Cases die by the death of 1,000 cuts. This is a cut on the case,"" Moore told CNN on Sunday.

Trump's co-defendant, Michael Roman, accused Willis and Wade of having an ""improper"" and ""clandestine"" affair at the same time appointments were being made for the 2020 election interference case.
Roman was a former official on Trump's 2020 campaign and argued about the integrity of the case being compromised because of the affair, asking last week for the charges to be dropped.
The filing also calls for the entire district attorney's office, including Willis and Wade, to be disqualified from prosecuting the case.
Moore said he would tell Willis to step away from the case.

""I really think that in this type of case, with these allegations, this case is bigger than any one prosecutor,"" Moore added. ""And I think, probably, to preserve the case and to show that what's of most importance to her is the facts of the Trump case, opposed to her political career.""
News broke that Trump was indicted by Willis in August, and he pleaded not guilty to charges related to allegedly attempting to subvert the results of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia, including violation of Georgia's anti-racketeering law.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
New York City Mayor Eric Adams vetoed a controversial city council bill that would require police officers to document every ""investigative encounter"" with the public.
At a press conference Friday, Adams said the proposed legislation, known as Intro. 586-A or the ""How Many Stops Act,"" could slow NYPD response times, undermine community-oriented policing, and add tens of millions of dollars in overtime to the NYPD budget. Namely, he took issue with how the proposed legislation would force New York City Police Department (NYPD) officers to spend more time filling out reports after Level 1 interactions with the public instead of patrolling the street and keeping the public safe.
""As young men, my brother and I were beaten by the police in the basement of a local precinct, but I turned my pain into purpose and joined the police force to effect change from within the system. And, in my time as a police officer and throughout my career in public service, I have fought for transparency and against abusive policing tactics that targeted communities of color. While Intro. 586 has good intentions behind it, the bill is misguided and compromises our public safety,"" Adams said in a statement.
""Our administration supports efforts to make law enforcement more transparent, more just, and more accountable, but this bill will handcuff our police by drowning officers in unnecessary paperwork that will saddle taxpayers with tens of millions of dollars in additional NYPD overtime each year, while simultaneously taking officers away from policing our streets and engaging with the community,"" he siad. ""That is why I am vetoing this legislation today. I ask my colleagues in government to please work with our administration to improve public safety because New Yorkers want their police out on patrol — taking criminals off our streets and keeping them safe.""

Adams cited serial stabbing suspect 27-year-old Jermain Rigueur, accused of at least five stabbings within about a week, arguing the bill would impede such quick arrests, FOX 5 reported.
The bill, co-sponsored by New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams, passed the council in December. It would require the NYPD to log and report basic information on level one, two, and three investigative encounters between the police and civilians. Officers would report on the race, age, and gender of the person approached, any factors leading to the interaction, and its outcomes. But NYPD Commissioner Edward A. Caban countered that the NYPD is already the country’s ""most intently watched, deeply scrutinized, and openly transparent law enforcement agency,"" saying the measure vetoed by Adams ""is an overreach that would result in the unintended consequence of literally slowing down the city’s progress.""

""Each day and night, NYPD officers carry on the dangerous, critical work of fighting crime on the streets. Terrorist plots have also been thwarted, and there is a renewed commitment among our rank and file to further build trust and strengthen relationships in every community,"" Caban said in a statement. ""These vital efforts will continue — and must continue, unimpeded by bureaucratic time-wasting tasks — because that is what New Yorkers expect and deserve.""
""On our watch, there is a continuation of lower overall crime, including a reduction in bellwether indicators like murder, burglary, and assault. We just ended a year in which NYPD officers reduced shooting incidents citywide by a factor not seen in nearly 30 years,"" Caban added. ""And as of this week, index crimes in New York City have dropped another 5 percent compared to last year — and an incredible 74 percent from three decades ago.""
At a press conference of his own, Williams accused Adams and the NYPD of being ""fearmongers who mislead the public.""

He and other councilmembers say the bill is meant to address the ""longstanding inequities"" faced by Black New Yorkers.
""The fact that Mayor Adams is getting his Trump on right now makes this even more difficult than it has to be,"" Williams said, according to FOX 5.
Adams also vetoes a separate city council bill aimed at banning solitary confinement.

KLBNONGJSS_N05U3ISR2284G17,WATCH: Migrants claim asylum on cold January night as CBP union leader talks border crisis,By Elizabeth Elkind Fox News,"Published January 21, 2024 4:00am EST",20240121,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/watch-migrants-claim-asylum-cold-january-night-cbp-union-leader-talks-border-crisis,"National Border Patrol Council Vice President Chris Cabrera spoke with a small group of reporters just yards away from the U.S.-Mexico border as a group of migrants, mainly families and unaccompanied children, sought asylum.
McALLEN, Texas – It was a frigid night along the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas when a group of about two dozen migrants, including unaccompanied children, were met by border officials after making the dangerous trek to claim asylum near midnight Friday evening.
""We have 22 people. One of them is a single adult male. The rest of them are either family units or unaccompanied children,"" Chris Cabrera, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, told a small group of reporters standing just feet away.
""I believe there's four unaccompanied children ranging in age from 7-11. There's also a family unit. One of them has a little boy that's approximately 16 months old.""
Cabrera said they were from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Ecuador. After turning themselves in to Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents, they then boarded buses on the U.S. side, where their asylum claims will be further processed.

But it’s not just asylum seekers agents encounter there, Cabrera explained.
""You have runners in the same area … and then you’ll see a lot of drugs coming through here. And, at times, you’ll have money or guns going south through here. You’ll have people trying to smuggle it into Mexico.""
Migrant encounters at the border have fallen off this month, the union spokesman said, but not before agents were overwhelmed by more than 300,000 people encountered in December, a record high.
""I remember there were times when you’d have one, two agents and 400 people,"" he said.
BIDEN ADMIN EYES MORE DEPORTATION FLIGHTS TO VENEZUELA AS MIGRANT NUMBERS SHATTER RECORDS
He spoke to reporters near a port of entry in McAllen, Texas, about 100 yards away from where the Rio Grande acts as a border between the U.S. and Mexico. Ladders were strewn across an open field that had been used by migrants to scale the 15-foot drop beyond the wall.
Cabrera said the ladders were used to try to bring people in illegally, mostly by human smugglers, in a ""coordinated effort.""
""At any given time, you’ll have 40, 50 people giving themselves up at this point,"" he said. ""And while our agents are doing paperwork on them … you’ll have three different groups within half a mile of here, throwing ladders up on the wall … knowing we can’t handle all the people we’re writing up and who’re climbing the wall at the same time.""

The CBP veteran, who has more than two decades’ experience in the field, said the environment he is working in has ""changed dramatically"" in recent years.
""It used to be we would have a downtime. We had a busy season. … People were coming in to work the fields, to pick crops and stuff like that. And then everybody would go home in November, December and start their journey back north again at the beginning of the year,"" Cabrera said.
""This past year, we had record number of apprehensions in December. They’re not coming to pick crops in December.""
Cabrera noticed a change in the people arriving.
""Not everybody's coming to work,"" he said. ""They're coming in for, you know, for asylum, or the illusion of asylum.
""Living in the bad neighborhood is not what asylum is. Not finding a job is not asylum. Fleeing from religious persecution, that's asylum. But, for some reason, this administration decided that asylum is whatever they want it to be,"" he said.
The record surge of undocumented migrants since 2021 has strained local infrastructure in Texas and other areas along the border. It’s also caused problems for large Democrat-run cities where migrants have been sent, like New York City, Chicago and Washington, D.C.

The next day, Cabrera pointed out that the flow of illegal drugs was hitting areas further north as well.
""We don't have a heroin problem in the Rio Grande Valley. We don't have a meth problem in the Rio Grande Valley. It comes through here, but it doesn’t stay here,"" he said. ""We don't have MS-13. … They're in Virginia, Maryland and D.C. They come through here, but they don't stay here. They're going to your areas.""

It comes as Democrats and Republicans in Washington negotiate policy changes to help control the border crisis, with the GOP pushing for stricter measures than the left has so far accepted.
Cabrera was concerned the message to D.C. was ""falling on deaf ears"" and pleaded with federal officials to put party affiliation aside.
""They need to put this aside as a partisan issue. It's not. It needs to be something that gets fixed for the good of this country,"" he said.

A California woman is reminding her neighbors of fond memories associated with Blockbuster Video through a ""Free Blockbuster"" movie exhange.
It's a spin on a ""Little Free Library"" – a non-profit book-sharing initiative where people donate and borrow books. ""Free Blockbuster"" is the same idea, but the box is filled with films and is painted in Blockbuster's classic colors — blue and yellow.
It was Alyssa Kollgaard, a video game developer in Los Angeles, who wanted to share her love for films through a creative and sentimental project.

Kollgaard has had a free food pantry outside her home for the past two years and realized she had an extra box that could be used for the Blockbuster box, she told Fox News Digital.

Her husband, Christian Kollgaard, is a professional fabricator for film and TV, so he helped assemble the perfect blue and yellow movie library.
The ""Free Blockbuster"" boxes are filled with DVDs. Kollgaard said she can also ""rent out"" VHS tapes, but those cannot remain in the box since they'd melt in the California heat.
Kollgaard has an extensive movie collection that she grew over the past 10 years. She and her husband even run a movie theater at the post-apocalyptic movie festival, ""Wasteland Weekend,"" she said.

""There is definitely a lot of nostalgia around the Blockbuster and I think, visually, the branding is really strong,"" Kollgaard said.
Blockbuster Video was an American movie rental chain that was founded in 1985. There were about 9,000 stores operating across the country, but as mail-in DVDs and streaming soared in popularity, physical movie rentals became obsolete and Blockbuster ceased operations in 2014.
There is one surviving Blockbuster located in Bend, Oregon. The store is privately owned.
Kollgaard said some people can find streaming to be overwhelming, and her Blockbuster box is helping them.

""The reception has been really strong because it replicates that experience of going to a store and browsing and checking something out and going home and watching it and then coming back and doing it again and seeing what's new,"" she explained.

Kollgaard has filled her ""Free Blockbuster"" with some science fiction films and slightly more avant-garde movies with a cult following — including ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Reefer Madness.""
Her neighbors can ""rent"" and return their movie choices or even exchange a movie to help the collection grow.
""Somebody took Kill Bill 2 and left Kill Bill 1 because it wasn't a part of my collection,"" Kollgaard said.

Kollgaard said she has found a real sense of community through this new hobby.
""A few people say they've been moved to tears, which I think is pretty amazing that we all have this shared memory of something,"" she said.

Matt Gaetz sentenced to probation,By Danielle Wallace Fox News,"Published January 21, 2024 2:45pm EST",20240121,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-hampshire-man-admitted-threatening-kill-rep-matt-gaetz-sentenced-probation,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
A New Hampshire man received probation after admitting to threatening to kill Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., whom he accused in a voicemail of ""coming for the gays.""
Allan Poller, 24, had already pleaded guilty in October to transmitting in interstate commerce a threat to injure the person of another.
He was sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay a $500 fine in federal court on Thursday, according to the New Hampshire Union Leader.
Poller, a Keene State College student at the time, called the Washington, D.C., office of a member of the U.S. House of Representatives on March 29, 2023, and left a voicemail message stating in part, ""I just want to let you know, Representative [Name], if you keep on coming for the gays, we’re gonna strike back and I guarantee you, you do not want to f--- with us.""

The FBI affidavit redacted the name of the member of Congress, but Gaetz previously confirmed he was the recipient of the voicemail.
In an episode of his podcast ""Firebrand,"" Gatez played out a snippet of Poller making the death threat.
""We will kill you if that’s what it takes. I will take a bullet to your f---ing head if you f--- with my rights anymore. And then if you want to keep going down that path, you know who’s next,"" Poller said in the call placed at approximately 12:20 a.m., according to the FBI affidavit.

""I believe in redemption and forgiveness. I hope he finds a better path,"" Gaetz told Fox News Digital Sunday.
Poller, a men's track athlete for Keene State, according to his profile on the school's website, was arrested on April 3, 2023.
Prosecutors say Poller later admitted to placing the call and leaving the message. He allegedly stated to investigators that he had been drinking and left the message after becoming angry while watching videos on the social media application TikTok.

Prosecutors previously said the charging statute provided a sentence of no greater than five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000.
Poller ""has used the catastrophic effect of his actions as a catalyst to begin a new path in his life,"" a sentencing memorandum written by his attorney read, according to WBTS. ""He has strengthened his bond with his family and has completely accepted recovery into his life.""

The U.S. Attorney's Office stressed how Poller, ""is a young man who has faced dramatic challenges in his life but had no prior contacts with the criminal justice system. He has also already faced significant consequences as a result of his conduct, arrest, and plea in this case.""

Mike Waltz, R-Fla., and Ron DeSantis campaign surrogate state senator Josh Kimbrell analyze the top GOP candidates’ campaign strategy ahead of the New Hampshire primary.
Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out of the 2024 presidential race Sunday and endorsed former President Donald Trump in the race, sparking applause from some social media commenters.
""If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it. But I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign,"" DeSantis said Sunday in a video posted to his X account Sunday afternoon.
DeSantis continued that despite previously having disagreements with Trump, he is throwing his support behind the 45th president in his run for the White House this year.
""It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,"" he said, adding: ""He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.""

The announcement was made just before the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, and after Trump easily won the Iowa caucuses last week.
Some Republicans and conservatives on social media celebrated the move as one that would strengthen Trump's campaign to defeat President Biden come November, while others thanked DeSantis for his conservative policies on the campaign trail.
""GREAT move by Governor Ron DeSantis! President @realDonaldTrump is uniting the GOP & we are closer than ever to taking our country back! #Trump2024,"" former Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake posted on X.

A Ph.D. student in Texas was criminally charged after authorities accused her of lying about being assaulted and then raking in as much as $40,000 from a GoFundMe intended to help her recover.
Roda Osman, a student in the African and African Diaspora Studies Department at the University of Texas at Austin, was recently charged with felony-level theft by deception. In September, a friend of Osman's started a GoFundMe called ""Help Roda Recover"" after Osman was allegedly hit in the face with a brick.
On Saturday, Osman told Fox News Digital she's innocent and that she is ""heartbroken"" over the allegations.
Osman posted a video on social media where she alleged that she was assaulted by a man who asked for her phone number and was rejected. In the footage, she appeared visibly upset and pointed to a swollen part of her face.

""This man just hit me in my face with a brick and all these Black men just watched, and they don't give a f–k,"" Osman said.
The video was widely circulated on Twitter and, according to NBC reporting at the time, the situation, ""[pointed] to a familiar pattern of backlash hurled at Black women when they publicly denounce harm from Black men.""
According to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital, the Houston Police Department claims that Osman was in an altercation with a man when she was hit with a water bottle.
""It appeared Defendant Osman and [the man] were in the middle of a verbal argument when Defendant Osman swung her right hand while holding an unknown object and hit [the man] in the face,"" the documents read. ""[The man] then swung his right hand while holding what appeared to be a plastic water bottle and struck Defendant in the face.""
""The video footage capturing the incident did not support Defendant Osman's recorded statement.""

Osman told Fox that she was being targeted by the manosphere, a group of anti-feminist social media users. (@rho.reports8 via TikTok)
Police also said they were contacted by a caller who accused Osman of running a fraudulent GoFundMe in 2020.
The 2020 GoFundMe was reportedly titled ""Help Black Muslim Mother Pay Her Medical Bill,"" and claimed that Osman was ""viciously assaulted by private security in Minneapolis, sustaining multiple facial contusions, a black eye and injuries to her leg. She needs an estimated $5,000 to pay for medical bills, legal fees, a new phone and more.""
The caller contacted the Minneapolis Police Department, but said that police could not corroborate the alleged assault. Authorities also spoke with a roommate named Rachel who accused Osman of scamming in the past.
""Ms. Rachel stated at first they were cool, but that she discovered Roda was scamming people and she wanted no part of it,"" the document said. ""Ms. Rachel mentioned the scam Roda took part in by creating the GoFundMe in 2020 claiming someone hit her but it was a lie.""
Osman spoke with Fox News Digital about the allegations on Saturday. She said that the head injury she suffered prevented her from knowing exactly what she had been struck by.

""I'm not guilty…as a person who suffered from a head injury from blunt force trauma and went online five minutes later for my own safety, I'm not obligated to remember every single detail correctly,"" Osman explained. ""That is unprecedented, and it's dangerous to victim-blame in that way, and to also hold me to a standard that is not legal.""
""I didn't see the weapon he hit me with,"" the student added. ""[A brick] is what it felt like. And that was the only weapon that I saw when I opened my eyes and I looked up…so that's what I believe the weapon of choice was.""
Osman also told Fox News Digital that she was being targeted by the ""manosphere,"" a group of anti-feminist social media users.
""The manosphere [is] targeting me…for speaking out against a Black man because Black women are supposed to protect Black men from the justice system,"" she said. ""But I refuse to be silenced when I have been harmed so brutally.""

According to Osman's UT–Austin webpage, her interests include ""Black feminist theory, ethnography, urban social movements, Black diasporic studies [and] decolonial studies."" Osman told Fox News Digital that the legal situation is making it difficult for her to focus on school.
""It's a horrible precedent to set for Black women, because Black women are already unprotected, and we are already silenced,"" Osman said. ""And this is sending a really bad message to all Black women telling them that if you are assaulted, and you do not remember every single detail correctly, you will be criminalized. And that is awful. And it's a scary, scary thing and I feel so heartbroken.""
GoFundMe told Fox News Digital that Osman has been banned from its website.

""GoFundMe has zero tolerance for the misuse of our platform and cooperates with law enforcement investigations of those accused of wrongdoing,"" a spokesperson explained. ""The fundraiser has been removed from the platform, all donors have been refunded, and Roda Osman has been banned from using the platform for any future fundraisers.""

Thomas Massie, R-Ky., joins ‘Fox News Sunday’ to forecast the 2024 presidential election as GOP candidates continue to trail Donald Trump by a wide margin.
As support for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in New Hampshire's upcoming Republican presidential primary appeared to dwindle in recent polling, a surrogate for DeSantis on Sunday waved off the polls, saying ""the real fight"" would be hashed out in the South Carolina primary.
Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., appeared on ""Fox News Sunday"" and was asked whether the two new polls showing DeSantis trailing former President Trump and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was the reason why the governor canceled a round of appearances on the Sunday show circuit.
""We never had high expectations for New Hampshire anyway,"" Massie responded. ""And Nikki’s exploiting a quirk of their primary, which is that undeclareds, i.e. Democrats, can vote in a Republican primary.""
""The real fight, I think, is in South Carolina,"" he continued. ""And that’s where Nikki Haley, I think, stumbles. She’s going to miss expectations and not even win her own state.""

(Boots on the Ground)
FIRST ON FOX: Animal welfare groups are calling on the Biden administration to address a large number of abandoned pets at the southern border.
Fox News Digital obtained photos and videos of pets in Colony Ridge, Texas, from animal advocacy group Boots on the Ground that were reportedly abandoned by migrants, including some that appear severely neglected or injured.
Scores of animals have been abandoned at the U.S.-Mexico border as illegal immigrants flood into the country in record-breaking numbers.
Immigrants who are apprehended by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) are often forced to leave their animals behind because animals are not allowed inside federal processing centers.
AS HISTORIC NUMBERS OF MIGRANTS CROSS THE BORDER, THEIR DOGS ARE OFTEN ABANDONED ALONG THE WAY

Chase Scott, spokesperson for Big Dog Ranch Rescue (BDRR), a dog rescue group, told Fox News Digital the ""number of abandoned dogs along the border is in the thousands,"" and the Biden administration is ""doing virtually nothing"" to address the situation.
Scott said BDRR ""can lead this effort"" but needs ""donations or help from FEMA to address this issue."" He called on FEMA to provide ""a dozen spay [and] neuter vans to stop the overpopulation"" and ""transport and medical supplies,"" so they ""can heal and rescue the dogs and get them into loving homes.""
""We need to act now before this becomes completely out of control,"" Scott said.
""Colony Ridge is a huge migrant shanty town with starving dogs trying to eat chickens and livestock, so the migrants shoot them and attack them with machetes. The local communities are heartbroken and overwhelmed. They are turning into a Third World [country] with roaming packs of dogs.""
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT POPULATION SOARS UNDER BIDEN: GOVERNMENT DATA
Scott said BDRR is heading to McAllen, Texas, this weekend on a rescue mission for the abandoned dogs after having gone to the Texas border city of Eagle Pass last year.
Scott said the dogs in McAllen, Texas, ""are being fed"" by the National Guard, ""but with the cold fronts, the situation is dire,"" and BDRR will be rescuing the dogs there first.
After McAllen, Scott said BDRR will head ""into the primary area with the largest issue,"" adding ""ground zero is Colony Ridge.""

Bianca Gracia, president of Latinos for America and Latinos for Trump, told Fox News Digital what ""is happening at Colony Ridge with the abandoned and abused dogs who are voiceless is a tragedy caused by elected officials' open border policies.
""We are asking America to step up and help us rescue these voiceless furry friends from a life they did not choose.""
Animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) told Fox News Digital it has received reports that it's not just dogs and cats being abandoned. Animals like guinea pigs have been left too.

Catie Cryar, spokesperson for PETA, told Fox News Digital that abandonment ""is awful — no matter which side of the border it occurs on.""
""PETA has received reports that animals as varied as guinea pigs and small dogs have actually been brought in by people entering the U.S. from Mexico, but we know that the border processing facilities don’t allow it,"" Cryar said.
""We have also heard of an informal network of people on the Mexican side who are looking after animals who have been denied entry,"" she added. ""Many animals are a cherished, integral part of the family and, just like children, should not be separated from that family.
""PETA is calling on the Biden administration to allow animals into the U.S. if they are vaccinated or can be quarantined.""
The White House referred Fox News Digital to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) when asked for comment.
""CBP follows CDC guidance with respect to the admission of dogs and other pets into the country,"" a spokesperson for CBP said. ""If the pet’s owner is an inadmissible noncitizen in DHS custody and an animal’s owner does not transfer possession to family or friends, U.S. Customs and Border Protection works with local officials from animal health services, such as a local humane shelter, to see if there can be placement for the animal while its owner remains in custody.""
Fox News Digital also reached out to FEMA and the National Guard for comment.

The shocking photos and footage obtained by Fox News Digital show the harsh reality faced by the dogs and other animals abandoned by their owners as they enter the U.S. at the southern border.
The footage depicts abandoned animals in the migrant community of Colony Ridge, Texas, a collection of subdivisions outside Houston.
Colony Ridge is a controversial locale, having made headlines after being sued by the federal government for allegedly hooking Latino buyers up with seller-financed mortgages to set them up for defaulting on their loans.
Colony Ridge CEO John Harris told Fox News Digital in a statement that ""Colony Ridge has done everything conceivably possible to rid the problem of stray dogs and cats and animals throughout the area.
""We have donated consistently $20,000 a year to help solve the problem to the local group that kind of helps spay and neuter and house these animals,"" Harris said. ""So, we are doing our part without question.""
Harris noted that Liberty County, which houses Colony Ridge, is a ""rural area"" that doesn't have an animal control group, and that if one goes ""anywhere in a rural county in America, and especially here in Texas, you're going to have stray dogs and cats and other animals.""
""That's just a fact,"" Harris said. ""But we are doing everything we possibly can to curb the problem.""
Harris also said ""90%"" of Colony Ridge residents ""come from Harris County,"" 40 miles to the south.

""The animal issue is not an immigrant issue. It's an issue that stems from bad owners who need to understand how to care for their animals,"" Harris said. ""We are providing that education and going above and beyond what is needed to help resolve this problem.""
The Community Property Owners Association of Colony Ridge told Fox News Digital that This is Houston, a nonprofit organization, has been assisting in the new development since 2021 due to Liberty County not having animal control services.

A man and a woman have been arrested for allegedly taking down part of an Oklahoma radio station's nearly 500-foot tower to steal some copper, Choctaw County Sheriff Terry Park says.
The tower, located in Hugo, belongs to Payne Media Group's station K95.5. The radio station posted a video of the damage on Facebook following the vandalism that took place Jan. 15.
""Cut the guy-wire on one leg and that's what brought entire top sections down,"" the video's narrator, identified to Fox News by the station as Will Payne, says. ""And then, they proceeded to disassemble.""
Cut hardware was shown as viewers were told how the transmission line connected to the antenna was targeted by the thieves.

""What they do, these copper thieves, is they cut it up in these 10-foot sections,"" Payne says. ""So right now we know that there's probably eight to 10 of these sections in the back of a truck or a van, maybe. This is what we need to be looking out for, and if you can help me out as we try to figure out our next step, what we're gonna do to rebuild this place.""
""Let's make them pay,"" Payne says about the crime that happened overnight, leaving the mangled tower on the ground. He said the copper taken would only be worth about $100, but Sheriff Park believes otherwise.

Washington, D.C. – Two leading pro-life activists discussed with Fox News Digital their thoughts about the future of the pro-life movement — and why, even in a post-Dobbs world, they are continuing their fight for life.
Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, has led the organization since the fall of 2012.
Speaking to Fox News Digital on the National Mall in the nation's capital shortly before the start of the 51st March for Life on Friday, Jan. 19, Mancini stressed the importance of accompanying women through their pregnancies and changing the culture surrounding pregnancy.
PASTOR GREG LAURIE ON WHY HE IS PRO-LIFE: 'MY LIFE WAS SAVED FROM ABORTION'
The theme of the 2024 March for Life was ""With every woman, for every child,"" something Mancini said was a nod to ""getting back to the pro-life roots.""
""The pro-life movement was made for this. I mean, this is why the march started,"" she said.
Jeanne Mancini, seen here in a 2016 photo, told Fox News Digital that her goal is to make abortion ""unthinkable.""  (Albin Lohr-Jones/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images)
With the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade in the June 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health decision, states were once again given the ability to make their own abortion legislation.
The March for Life, too, is moving to individual states, Mancini told Fox News Digital.
The first state March for Life was the 2018 Virginia March for Life, she said.
""This year, we will be in 16 states,"" she said. ""We plan to be in all 50 states in the next six to seven years.""
HUMAN TRAFFICKING SURVIVOR, A MOM OF A SON, ADDRESSES MARCH FOR LIFE: ‘WE ARE HERE TO SAVE SOULS’
The national March for Life, she said, is a means of ""uniting, equipping and mobilizing pro-life Americans in the public square.""
While there was a moral victory with Dobbs for the pro-life movement, the work on the ground, so to speak, remains, she said.
""I wish that we could finish marching, but we haven't yet built a culture of life in the United States.""
""The overturning of Roe didn't make abortion illegal at all. It just allowed states to be able to enact pro-life protections prior to 20 weeks,"" said Mancini. ""And more importantly, it didn't make it unthinkable.""
Making abortion ""unthinkable"" is Mancini's goal.
""Anyone who thinks that our work is done and that we've finished building a culture of life right now is wrong,"" she said. ""I mean, we're just not yet done. So I wish that we could finish marching, but we haven't yet built a culture of life in the United States.""

Mancini highlighted the work the March for Life was doing this year to raise money for and promote the work of pregnancy resource centers and maternity homes, which assist women who are in need during their pregnancies.
These organizations do not promote abortions.

A recent study, said Mancini, found that nearly a million people were served last year at pregnancy resource centers or maternity homes.
""And that's that's not including the unborn babies,"" she said. ""So we could say nearly 2 million were served in the movement this year at the tune of $358 million in resources.""
One of the goals of this year's March for Life was to promote the work of pregnancy resource centers and maternity homes, Jeanne Mancini told Fox News Digital.  (Aubrie Spady/Fox News Digital)
In addition to providing ""simple things"" like diapers and formula, she said, some of the organizations also assist mothers with housing, health care, counseling and school credits.
""The pro-life movement is about the full flourishing of mom and baby,"" said Mancini.
Lila Rose, founder of the pro-life organization Live Action, began engaging in pro-life activism as a teenager.
She is now married and a mother herself, and is pregnant with a child due this spring.

In a phone interview with Fox News Digital from California on Saturday, Jan. 20, ahead of her speech at the Walk for Life West Coast, Rose said that the pro-life movement still has a lot of work to do.
With the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs, ""we won a crucial battle, but the war is left to be won,"" said Rose.

""So that's that's why we march and walk. Because we're at war. And the war hasn't been won yet.""
In addition to cultural changes in society, Rose stressed the need to continue changing laws as well to protect the unborn.
""The new north star of the movement is equal protection, as promised by the 14th Amendment,"" Rose told Fox News Digital. ""So that's work that happens at both the federal and the state level.""
FOUNDER OF SAFE HAVEN BABY BOXES SHARES HER STORY AND HOPE FOR THE FUTURE: ‘A GOD-GIVEN PURPOSE’
These changes will likely not come quickly, said Rose.
""As human beings, we often think about change in terms of days, weeks, maybe a few years,"" she said. ""But the reality is the deepest changes, the generational changes, happen over lifetimes.""
""The new north star of the movement is equal protection, as promised by the 14th Amendment.""
It is up to the pro-life movement to keep this work up in the meantime, she said.
California, Rose's home state and where she's currently based, legalized abortion prior to the Roe v. Wade decision.
In Nov. 2022, just months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, Californians voted to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution.

Rose said the political situation in California is ""very dire,"" but expressed hope and determination in regard to the future of the pro-life movement.
""The ideologies that right now are in power in California politically do not have and cannot have a future, because they're anti-human, they're anti-family and they're anti-children,"" she said.
The pro-life movement must ""take back institutions one at a time,"" Lila Rose told Fox News Digital. Above, a scene from the 51st March for Life in Washington, D.C. (Tierney L. Cross/Bloomberg via Getty Images)
The long-term strategy for California, she said, is to ""take back the institutions one at a time"" and usher in a culture of life.
Rose believes that the current pro-abortion movement as a whole is unable to sustain itself.

""The pro-abortion opposition is very anti-natalist,"" she said. ""They're very pro-population control. They are not pro-marriage. They're not pro-child.""
Added Rose, ""And that's what's so encouraging about our movement. Those who believe in faith, family, freedom — they're the ones who are actually building the families and the institutions that are going to be the future.""

SE79X1J8MX_VXRB90RZE78WNFZ,Lawyer in Trump defamation case won't introduce 'Access Hollywood' tape ahead of possible testimony,By Anders Hagstrom Fox News,"Published January 21, 2024 8:44am EST",20240121,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lawyer-trump-defamation-case-wont-introduce-access-hollywood-tape-possible-testimony,"Piers Morgan says a potential Trump 2024 win would be 'one of the great comebacks' in political history on 'One Nation.'
The infamous ""Access Hollywood"" tape will not be presented to New York jurors tasked with considering a defamation case against former President Donald Trump leveled by writer E. Jean Carroll.
Carroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, revealed that the jury would be presented with neither the tape nor two other women who accused Trump of abuse. The revelation means Trump's testimony in the case is likely to arrive sooner than expected, possibly Monday, one day before the Republican primary in New Hampshire.
Kaplan argued that she wants the trial to remain ""focused"" on Carroll's accusations, not Trump's other alleged sex crimes.
The new trial comes after a federal jury in New York City decided last year that Trump was not liable for rape but was liable for sexual abuse and defamation. The former president has been ordered to pay Carroll $5 million.

Carroll, 80, alleged that Trump raped her at the Bergdorf Goodman department store across the street from Trump Tower in Manhattan sometime in 1996. According to Carroll, the two had a chance run-in at the store, where Trump was shopping for a gift for ""a girl."" She said he asked for her advice, and the two shopped together before he pushed her into a dressing room and assaulted her.
MELANIA TRUMP ANNOUNCES PASSING OF 'BELOVED' MOTHER: 'WE WILL MISS HER BEYOND MEASURE'
Trump denied the claim repeatedly, leading Carroll to sue him for defamation, arguing that his denial had harmed her reputation.

Carroll plans to testify about the damage to her career and reputation that resulted from Trump’s public statements. She seeks $10 million in compensatory damages and millions more in punitive damages.

Trump announced his own plans to testify in a post on social media last week.
""I should be in New Hampshire, campaigning and fighting for our Country, and I will be later today, but for now I had to spend time in a Federal Courthouse with a Trump Hating, Radical Left Judge, on a case that is another politically biased WITCH HUNT — ONE DAY AFTER IOWA, AND JUST AHEAD OF THE IMPORTANT NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY,"" Trump wrote. ""THIS HOAX, WHICH THE ‘BULLY’ JUDGE CHOSE TO HAVE AS TWO TRIALS INSTEAD OF MERGING INTO ONE, IS A DISGRACE, AND EVERYONE KNOWS IT. His former Law Clerk(?) is on the other side.""

Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Mn, blasted President Biden as ""unelectable and weak"" during a campaign event in New Hampshire, where Biden is set to skip the first Democratic presidential primary this week.
Phillips is challenging Biden in the Democratic primary, and New Hampshire represents his top opportunity. Biden chose to skip the state's primary entirely after New Hampshire declined to give up its first primary slot to South Carolina.
While Biden supporters are organizing a write-in campaign to prevent Phillips from securing a win, he still says he hopes to secure upward of 20% of the vote.
""Sadly it's going to demonstrate that our incumbent president is unelectable and weak and I think it's going to show this country that there's a candidate here who can actually do here what has been promised for generations,"" Phillips told reporters at a campaign event.

Members of the Turtle Hospital in the Florida Keys took to the sand to give Tina a memorable send-off.
An aquarium in Texas has been rehabilitating hundreds of turtles while a historic cold wave sweeps across Texas.
The Texas State Aquarium in Corpus Christi initiated a large-scale response aimed at preserving sea turtle species that will be impacted by the freezing weather. The aquarium's Port Corpus Christi Center for Wildlife Rescue is one of the largest rescue centers for sea turtles in the United States, with the capacity to save thousands of turtles.
The rescue center opened in 2023 and has rehabilitated hundreds of turtles since – and is preparing to help even more this winter.
SEA TURTLE WITH NET AROUND ITS NECK IS RESCUED BY SPEEDBOAT TOUR GUIDE IN HEROIC MOMENT
The Texas State Aquarium told Fox News Digital that it rehabilitated over 320 turtles last week — and has been preparing for another freeze.
While the turtles living in the aquarium will remain warm thanks to heaters, thousands of wild turtles in the Gulf of Mexico are at risk of cold-stunning.

In cold-stunning, turtles and other marine reptiles become weak and unconscious after being exposed to cold water for too long.
They are unable to regulate their body temperatures as mammals can.
Texas Parks and Wildlife uses boats to monitor the waters to see where turtles appear stunned. Rescue teams are then dispatched to take them to warmer waters.

The hundreds of impacted wild turtles will be moved to the emergency response pools after being rescued in the wild, the organizations indicated.
Texas State Aquarium CEO Jesse Gilbert told Fox News Digital that cold-stunning generally happens when the water reaches 55 degrees Fahrenheit.

MANCHESTER, N.H. – With two days to go until New Hampshire's Republican presidential primary, two new polls indicate former President Donald Trump remains the commanding front-runner, with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley behind by double-digits, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis a distant third.
Trump, who is running a third straight time for the White House, stands at 50% support in a University of New Hampshire/CNN poll released Sunday morning.
Haley, who served as ambassador to the United Nations during the Trump administration, grabbed 39% support. And DeSantis, once the clear runner-up to Trump in most polling, was at 6%.
Trump's 11-point lead over Haley in the new survey is up from a seven-point advantage in the previous UNH/CNN poll, which was conducted earlier in the month.

Meanwhile, the former president grabbed 55%, according to a daily tracking poll released Sunday morning by Suffolk University, the Boston Globe and NBC10 in Boston.
The former president's support edged up two points from Saturday's tracking poll.
Haley stood at 36%, with her support unchanged from the previous day. And DeSantis pulled in 6% support, edging down a point over the past 24 hours.
Both polls were conducted entirely after Trump scored a convincing victory in Monday night's low-turnout Iowa caucuses, the first contest on the GOP presidential nominating calendar.
TRUMP RUNNING MATE SPECULATION SWIRLS AHEAD OF NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY
A poll from Saint Anselm College that was also conducted after the Iowa caucuses also indicates Trump with a lead in the mid-teens over Haley and DeSantis in single digits in New Hampshire.

Meanwhile, a new survey released Friday from Marist College indicates Haley performing better against President Biden than either Trump or DeSantis in hypothetical general election matchups in November in New Hampshire, which is a key battleground state.
The survey indicates Haley edging Biden by three points, while the president tops Trump by seven points and DeSantis by nine points. Haley repeatedly emphasized on the campaign trail that she would perform better against Biden in the general election than Trump would fare against the president.
TIM SCOTT ENDORSEMENT OF TRUMP LATEST SIGN GOP CONSOLIDATING AROUND FORMER PRESIDENT
Both new surveys indicate Trump dominating among registered Republicans, with Haley grabbing majority support among independents, who are known as undeclared voters in New Hampshire. Independents can vote in either major party's contest, and have long played an influential role in the state's storied presidential primary.
""We need big margins, ""Trump urged his supporters as he spoke at a rally Saturday night in Manchester, which is New Hampshire's largest city. ""Because we have to send real unity as a message.""

But the former president's campaign appeared to be tempering expectations.
""A win is a win,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita told reporters ahead of the rally. ""A win by five, a win by six, a win by seven.""
And LaCivita argued that Haley should end her campaign if she doesn't win on Tuesday, saying ""she should drop out.""

But Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney told reporters on Saturday that they're moving full speed ahead to South Carolina, which holds the next major contest in the GOP presidential nominating calendar, on Feb. 24.
Ankney said Haley will hold a large event in her hometown of Charleston, South Carolina on Wednesday, the same day that the campaign will launch a $4 million statewide ad blitz.
The Suffolk University poll questioned 500 likely Republican presidential primary voters in New Hampshire on Friday and Saturday, with an overall sampling error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.
The UNH/CNN survey was conducted January 16-19, with 2,348 New Hampshire adults questioned. The poll's overall sampling error is plus or minus two percentage points.

The UNH/CNN survey also polled the state's Democratic presidential primary.
Sixty-three percent of those likely to vote in the Democratic contest said they would write in President Biden's name, with Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota at 10% support and self-help author Marianne Williamson at 9%.
With New Hampshire holding an unsanctioned Democratic presidential primary, the president declined to place his name on the ballot.

THQS81LK54_VJGNN7KB6ERKMQL,What color looks best on me? Expert tips for choosing the color palette that works best for your tones,By Maeghan Dolph Fox News,"Published January 21, 2024 10:37am EST",20240121,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/expert-tips-choosing-clothing-color-palette-best-tones,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Selecting the right clothing color palette is a crucial aspect of personal style.
The colors you wear can greatly impact your overall appearance, enhancing your features and boosting your confidence.
Here's a guide on how you can find the perfect color match for your complexion with help from stylist and personal shopper Mona Sharaf.
Before delving into the world of colors, it's essential to understand your skin undertones.
Undertones are the subtle hues beneath the surface of your skin, categorized as warm, cool or neutral.
AS WEDDING COLOR OF THE YEAR IS ANNOUNCED FOR 2024, SEE THE HUE THAT BRIDES ARE EXPECTED TO CHOOSE
""Determining whether you are cool or warm can sometimes only be done by an expert. There are theories online that you can tell by the color of your veins, but I don’t find that to be true,"" Sharaf told Fox News Digital.
Sharaf studied image consulting at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City and has worked for well-known designers, including Norma Kamali. The often misconceived theory is that greenish veins often indicate warm undertones, while bluish veins suggest cool undertones and neutral undertones may have a mix of both.
""Having your correct undertones assessed by a professional image consultant is really the best way to know. However, if you wanted to try to assess on your own, I would take a look at the pigment of your skin. If it’s more pink or olive, you wear cool colors, if your skin is more yellow and less pink and/ or you tend to freckle in the sun, you are likely warm.""
Choosing the right colors that complement your skin tone can significantly enhance your overall appearance. Consider factors like your undertones, which can be warm, cool or neutral. (iStock)
For individuals with warm undertones, earthy colors are the way to go.
Think of warm shades like reds, oranges, yellows and browns. These colors complement the golden or peachy undertones in your skin, creating a harmonious look. Mustard, rust and olive green are also excellent choices for a warm-toned wardrobe.
OBTAINING THE LOOK AND FEEL OF QUIET LUXURY, A FASHION TREND THAT'S ONLY GROWING
If you have cool undertones, jewel tones can work wonders for your wardrobe.
Shades like sapphire blue, emerald green and amethyst purple can enhance the coolness in your skin, creating a sophisticated appearance.
Cool-toned individuals may also find pastels like mint green and lavender complementing their undertones.
NEW YEAR, NEW STYLE: TRICKS TO HELP GET RID OF CLOTHES YOU HAVEN'T WORN
Neutral undertones have the flexibility to pull off a wide range of colors.
However, individuals with neutral undertones often look particularly stunning in classic neutrals like black, white, gray and navy. These timeless hues provide a versatile base for any wardrobe, allowing individuals with neutral undertones to experiment with various accent colors.
The color wheel is a valuable tool that can guide you in creating harmonious color combinations. Complementary colors, analogous colors and triadic colors are concepts worth exploring to find the perfect balance.
""When you are wearing your ‘right’ colors you look more youthful, brighter, texture (freckles, blemishes, wrinkles, age spots, discoloration) in your skin fades. Even your oily t-zones fade away! You just look more rested and radiant in general,"" says Sharaf.

Don't hesitate to seek advice from professionals to discover the perfect palette for your wardrobe and personal style. (iStock)
Contemporary color choices strategically place opposing hues on the color wheel, fostering a bold contrast. This combination elevates visual appeal, giving a modern touch to design and aesthetics.
The juxtaposition of these contrasting colors infuses vibrancy and energy, establishing contemporary color schemes as a favored option across diverse artistic and design realms.
Analogous colors are those that neighbor each other on the color wheel, sharing similar undertones.

Widely used in design and art, analogous colors offer a sense of coordination. Their subtle variations allow for creative expression while maintaining a balanced overall look.
Triadic colors involve selecting three hues evenly spaced around the color wheel, forming an equilateral triangle.
The chosen colors are usually primaries or secondaries, creating a diverse yet cohesive look.
Popular in art and design, triadic palettes offer an interplay of colors, enhancing aesthetic appeal with a sense of unity.
Sharaf emphasized the importance of aligning your wardrobe color palette with your lifestyle and personality.
""All of this leads you to feeling more confident. When we are confident, we perform better in everything we do, whether it’s making a presentation at work, going on a date, or taking pictures,"" says Sharaf.

Your clothing colors should resonate with who you are and the image you want to project. Consider the settings you're in, your professional requirements, and your personal preferences while choosing your correct clothing color palette.
For a professional setting, neutral colors like black, gray and navy can convey a polished and sophisticated image. If you're more adventurous, injecting bold colors or patterns into your wardrobe can showcase your personality.
The key to understanding your wardrobe color palette is to have fun exploring colors and expressing your unique style with confidence.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
San Francisco Mayor London Breed on Friday blasted the city supervisors' resolution calling for an extended cease-fire in Gaza as divisive and fanning the flames of antisemitism, though she stopped short of issuing a veto.
The Democrat mayor, who is up for reelection this year, wrote in a statement online that the debate over the nonbinding resolution has left the city ""angrier, more divided and less safe"" as ""abject antisemitism"" had apparently become acceptable to a subset of activists.
""The antisemitism in our city is real and dangerous,"" she wrote, adding that vetoing the resolution would send the issue back to the board, in whom she has ""no confidence,"" lead to more divisive hearings and ""fan even more antisemitic acts.""
Breed said she had spoken to numerous Jewish residents ""who tell me they don't feel safe in their own city. ... They are fearful of the growing acts of vandalism and intimidation.""
ANTISEMITISM IS GETTING WORSE AS MORE ‘SHOCKING’ AND ‘SCARY’ INCIDENTS ARE EXPOSED, DC RESIDENTS SAY

A divided board approved the resolution earlier this month, which also condemned Hamas as well as the Israeli government and urged the Biden administration to press for the release of all hostages and delivery of humanitarian aid.
Breed wrote that the board members, and even herself as mayor, are not elected or qualified to weigh in on foreign policy.

""Their exercise was never about bringing people together,"" Breed wrote in a statement. ""It was about choosing a side.""

Breed wrote that despite the board putting San Francisco in a ""terrible position,"" she ""must choose unity.""

U6MLB2FBEA_FB6Y6QO2CU7QHII,Pro-life health care workers urge pro-family policies as major medical institutions push abortion,"By Thomas Phippen , Aubrie Spady Fox News","Published January 21, 2024 4:00am EST",20240121,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pro-life-healthcare-workers-urge-pro-family-policies-medical-institutions-abortion,"Chris Faddis, Solidarity HealthShare president, spoke with Fox News Digital at the annual March for Life about the current attacks on pro-life health care.
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Pro-life advocates may have faced political setbacks across the country since Roe v. Wade was overturned, effectively granting states the ability to regulate abortion.
As thousands gathered in the snow Friday on the National Mall ahead of the march around the Capitol to the Supreme Court, many called for a continued expansion of the pro-life cause to include policies and programs to help mothers and families, not just work on legal battles.
""It's important that we not just combat the harm of abortion that it's causing our patients, but also recognize why women are oftentimes seeking abortion and do something about that,"" Christina Francis, CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), told Fox News Digital on the sidelines of the March for Life Friday.
But some pro-life activists in the health profession told Fox News Digital they see other wins since the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson overturned nearly 50 years of Roe precedent. Doctors and medical professionals are rejecting messages from advocates for abortion.

""We definitely have seen a growth in our membership in the last two years, especially right after Dobbs. We had a huge increase in membership,"" Francis said.
AAPLOG's medical student and resident fellowships increased from about 200 to around 400 since the 2022 Dobbs decision, and total membership increased from 7,000 to around 7,500. In the past decade, the group tripled in total membership.
Some new members join AAPLOG due to feeling left behind by the pro-choice stances of the major medical institutions, according to Francis.
""What they're realizing now is that we are under active attack, I would say ... not just from pro-abortion advocates, but from our major certifying bodies,"" Francis said.
""Many of them are seeing the veil has been lifted, I think, on the true position of some of our major medical associations.""
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), according to Francis, has acted inconsistently with many OB/GYNs' beliefs about providing quality health care.
In August 2023, ACOG Interim President Christopher Zahn wrote in a letter to The Washington Post expressing the belief abortion access should not be limited.
""Abortion is safe. It improves and saves lives, and it must be available without restrictions, without limitations and without barriers — just as any other critical part of health care,"" Zahn wrote.
PRO-LIFE GROUPS HAMMER ‘TWISTED ATTEMPT’ BY DEMOCRATIC AGS TO ‘HINDER’ PREGNANCY CENTERS FROM HELPING WOMEN
""I think that many physicians are seeing now how radical that position is,"" said Francis. ""Maybe they're not exactly in the same position I am on abortion, but they recognize that there should at the very least be some limitation, and there should be safeguards put into place for women's safety and to ensure that they're in good care. We really are seeing a lot of physicians and other medical professionals wake up to what's been going on in our profession for quite some time.""
ACOG last year released a fact sheet that dismissed as misinformation some pro-life terms — particularly the claims that abortion defenders want abortion to be legal to the point of birth.

""'[A]bortion up until birth' or ‘abortion after birth’ are examples of derogatory language used by opponents of abortion access that is not based in facts. Neither is accurate, and neither uses clinically appropriate language,"" ACOG's website states.
ACOG also says abortion later in pregnancy is rare and indicates that ""something has gone terribly wrong regarding the patient’s health or the pregnancy.""
Viewing abortion as something involving a single patient, according to Francis, is one of the issues driving medical practitioners to question the major health groups that insist abortion is health care.
PRO-LIFE VOTERS REVEAL HOW THEY REALLY FEEL ABOUT TRUMP'S STANCE ON ABORTION
""We know that induced abortion is not health care. It ends the life of one of our patients, and it significantly harms our other patients,"" said Francis.
""They need to point out the extreme, radical nature of what [Democrats] will do if they get into office and have the majorities in the House, Senate and the White House. It'll be abortion until birth. In debates, when facing down your Democratic opponent, make him or her defend that.""
""This abortion fight is it's not just Planned Parenthood clinics and the pregnancy centers, it is in health care today,"" said Chris Faddis, president of Solidarity HealthShare.
""The health care system is pushing people more and more towards early fetal testing, so they can push people to abortions and their children into, you know, Planned Parenthood for regular female care, so they can get them on birth control and a board of patients and those things,"" Faddis said.
AHEAD OF MARCH FOR LIFE, MISSISSIPPI UNVEILS MOBILE APP TO HELP PREGNANT MOMS
Concerned Women for America President Penny Nance told Fox News Digital a priority for the pro-life movement must be expanding ways for struggling pregnant women and mothers to get assistance, be it public or private.
""We know the No. 1 reason a woman chooses abortion is that she isn't supported,"" said Nance.
One proposal is a national clearinghouse where a pregnant woman can search her zip code for resources near her — not just medical, but financial assistance, help with bills and food or employment. The idea is similar to a program in Mississippi that launched in the past year to collect public assistance and nonprofits into one searchable database.

March for Life has also been a political advocacy group, and in light of recent setbacks at the ballot box for abortion issues, pro-lifers have urged pro-life politicians not to avoid the issue, but to put Democrats on the defensive.
""They need to point out the extreme, radical nature of what [Democrats] will do if they get into office and have the majorities in the House, Senate and the White House. It'll be abortion until birth. In debates, when facing down your Democratic opponent, make him or her defend that,"" said Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J.

WRPGKI9VC4_PEJ6V9Z71WSY1RB,"Ozempic and Wegovy overdose calls have spiked, experts say — here’s what to know about dangerous doses",By Melissa Rudy Fox News,"Published January 21, 2024 4:30am EST",20240121,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/health/ozempic-wegovy-overdose-calls-spiked-experts-say-heres-know-dangerous-doses,"Fitness guru Denise Austin told Fox News Digital that weight loss drugs aren’t as important as activating your muscle memory.
As the popularity of semaglutide weight-loss medications continues to grow, so does the rate of potentially dangerous overdoses, experts are warning.
Reported overdoses of semaglutide products such as Ozempic and Wegovy more than doubled between 2022 and 2023, according to America’s Poison Centers in Virginia.
""U.S. Poison Centers have documented 3,316 exposures to products containing semaglutide through Dec. 31, 2023, more than two times the number of cases reported in 2022,"" Dr. Kait Brown, clinical managing director of America’s Poison Centers, told Fox News Digital via email.
OZEMPIC AND WEGOVY COULD LEAD TO MUSCLE LOSS, EXPERTS SAY, BUT PREVENTION IS POSSIBLE
""These cases include exposures to prescription semaglutide, compounded semaglutide and counterfeit semaglutide,"" he said.
""Most of these cases are associated with accidental therapeutic errors in adults.""
Reported overdoses of semaglutide products like Ozempic and Wegovy more than doubled between 2022 and 2023, according to America’s Poison Centers in Virginia. (iStock)
Semaglutide medications are intended to be given in a low dose and increased slowly over a four-week period, according to Dr. Seth Kipnis, director of bariatric and robotic surgery at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune, New Jersey.
""If people jump right to the high dose, they will have more initial negative side effects,"" he told Fox News Digital.
U.S. poison centers have documented 3,316 exposures to products containing semaglutide through Dec. 31, 2023, more than two times the number of cases reported in 2022.
In some cases, people who overdose may be getting the medication from a source other than a local doctor or taking someone else's prescribed medication, the doctor noted.
People with a semaglutide prescription should follow the manufacturer’s and prescribing physician's instructions, Kipnis advised.
""The dose is weekly,"" he said. ""If it is taken daily, it is too much.""
Compounded versions of these drugs dispensed in multi-dose vials present a greater overdose risk, experts warned. (iStock)
Dr. Maryann Amirshahi, co-medical director of the National Capital Poison Center in Washington, D.C., confirmed that there has been a large overall increase in semaglutide overdoses reported to poison centers nationally.
""In addition, I have noticed a similar increase at my individual center,"" Amirshahi, who is also professor of emergency medicine at the Georgetown University School of Medicine, told Fox News Digital.
The doctor attributes the increase to several factors, chiefly the ""huge increase"" in semaglutide prescribing.
OZEMPIC AND WEGOVY WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS COULD HELP REDUCE ALCOHOL USE DISORDER SYMPTOMS, STUDY SUGGESTS
""Secondarily, it is available in several different forms, which can cause confusion,"" Amirshahi noted.
""Ozempic is a dial-up pen with multiple doses — while Wegovy is a single-dose pen.""
Another source of confusion is that many people are using compounded products.
The most commonly reported overdose symptoms of semaglutide medication use include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness and diarrhea. (iStock)
""Compounded versions have their own unique risks when it comes to a potential overdose, especially when they’re dispensed in multi-dose vials,"" noted Alyssa Billingsley, PharmD, Missouri-based director of pharmacy content at GoodRx.
""These injections are often dispensed in vials, so there’s a greater opportunity for dosing errors since you’re measuring out your specific dose with a syringe,"" she warned.
""In some cases, the vial may contain as much as 10 times the amount of semaglutide as a single-use injection pen.""
The most commonly reported overdose symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness and diarrhea, Brown noted.
""Some people have reported hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), which can be life-threatening,"" she said.
Danish multinational pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk A/S office building is located in Fremont, California. Novo Nordisk provided a statement to Fox News Digital about the reported overdoses. (iStock)
Symptoms of low blood sugar include confusion, tremor, lightheadedness and palpitations, according to Amirshahi.
""Semaglutide slows stomach emptying, which can lead to nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain,"" she said.
In some cases, the stomach becomes almost paralyzed, a condition called gastroparesis, which can lead to dehydration, abnormal electrolytes and kidney damage, said Amirshahi.
OZEMPIC, OTHER WEIGHT-LOSS DRUGS MAY STRENGTHEN NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS, EXPERTS SAY: HEALTH GOAL 'BOOST'
Another potential effect of semaglutide overdose is inflammation of the pancreas.
""Symptoms of pancreatitis are very similar and can include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and dehydration,"" Amirshahi noted.
These signs and symptoms can also occur among patients taking normal doses of the medication as well as in overdoses, she added.

While any drug overdose can be serious, experts noted that taking too much semaglutide is rarely fatal.
""Semaglutide is generally well-tolerated in overdose compared to other diabetes medications,"" Amirshahi said.
""Anything is possible when an FDA-approved drug is taken inappropriately.""
However, for people who develop gastroparesis or pancreatitis, potential complications can include dehydration and kidney damage.
""While low blood sugar is rare with semaglutide overdose, if it is not detected and treated early, it can lead to seizures,"" Amirshahi added.
Kipnis noted that in terms of adverse effects, ""anything is possible when an FDA-approved drug is taken inappropriately.""
Anyone who is taking a prescribed semaglutide should have a primary care physician or medical provider to provide close follow-up support, especially in the first several weeks as the dose increases, Kipnis advised.
Although there is no specific antidote for a semaglutide overdose, the primary course of action is to treat the abdominal symptoms with nausea and pain medications, correct electrolytes, and give fluids for dehydration, said Amirshahi.
In some cases, it may be possible to manage symptoms at home after consulting with a health care professional, but other situations may require immediate medical attention, experts said. (iStock)
""We also treat the low blood sugar by giving glucose or dextrose,"" she said. ""The care is really supportive until the effects of the medication wear off.""

""For example, severe vomiting can result in serious dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which can be dangerous if left untreated,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""Severe cases of hypoglycemia can also be life-threatening.""
To prevent an overdose, Billingsley said to make sure you feel comfortable and confident using the injection pen and selecting your specific dose.

When contacted by Fox News Digital regarding the potential for overdoses, Novo Nordisk, maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, provided a statement.
""Novo Nordisk is the only company in the U.S. with FDA-approved products containing semaglutide, identified under the trade names Wegovy, Ozempic and RYBELSUS, and should only be prescribed after a close consultation between a health care provider and a patient and should only be taken under the supervision of a health care provider,"" the company said.
It added, ""Novo Nordisk stands behind the safety and efficacy of our FDA-approved semaglutide medicines when used as indicated and when taken under the care of a licensed health care professional.""

X1HIKY3EWG_4SXMKVSRX8MBOHJ,California couple in 'Gone Girl' case vindicated after accusations of staged kidnapping,By Christina Coulter Fox News,"Published January 21, 2024 4:00am EST",20240121,foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-couple-gone-girl-case-vindicated-accusations-staged-kidnapping,"Matthew Muller asks for a jury trial
A California couple faced national media scrutiny after surviving a harrowing kidnapping for ransom after police accused them of staging the attack in the spirit of the Ben Affleck thriller ""Gone Girl."" The 2015 abduction of Denise Huskins and her harrowing 48 hours in captivity — she was raped before she finally escaped — was written off by the Vallejo Police Department as an ""orchestrated event,"" according to new Netflix docuseries ""American Nightmare.""
Directed by ""The Tinder Swindler"" filmmakers Felicity Morris and Bernadette Higgins, the January release leads viewers through the couple's ordeal, their efforts to be believed and the ultimate confirmation of their story when a similar crime 40 miles away led to their attacker's capture three months later.
The couple sued the Vallejo Police Department for $2.5 million, but not before enduring months of public scrutiny. Aaron Quinn, Huskins' boyfriend, called police a day after his girlfriend's abduction from his Vallejo home.

His story seemed fantastical. He and Huskins, he said, awoke around 3 a.m. March 23, 2015, to flashing lights and what appeared to be a cadre of intruders wearing wetsuits.
Armed with stun guns, the intruders instructed Huskins to bind Quinn with zip ties. Then, Quinn told police, he was blinded with swim goggles covered in duct tape and affixed with foam earphones.
A pre-recorded message told him that he would be sedated. If he refused oral drugs, the recording allegedly said, it would be administered intravenously. After his blood pressure was taken, Quinn was dosed with a combination of Nyquil and Diazepam, according to the documentary.

When he came to, Quinn was told Huskins would be kidnapped. To ensure her safe return, Quinn relayed to police, the intruders demanded $15,000. They said cameras would be installed to monitor Quinn's movements, and Huskins would be hurt if he left the device's view. Although they said in a press conference that they were treating the case as a kidnapping, KRON4 reported, the Vallejo Police Department suspected Quinn of murdering his girlfriend and fabricating his account. He endured 18 hours of questioning, according to the docuseries.

In interrogation footage taken at the Vallejo Police Department and shown in ""American Nightmare,"" Det. Mathew Mustard grills Quinn on the status of his relationship with Huskins and whether he had been cheating on her. ""I don't think you're being truthful, and I don't think anybody came into your house,"" Mustard told Quinn, saying he would look like a ""monster"" if he waited to come clean.

The FBI administered a lie detector test, during which Quinn repeatedly denied an agent's accusations he had harmed his girlfriend. The agency alleged the polygraph indicated Quinn was being dishonest, but its results were actually inconclusive, ""American Nightmare"" showed.
Meanwhile, Huskins had been stuffed into the trunk of Quinn's car and taken to a property in South Lake Tahoe. There, she was sexually assaulted twice on camera, with her attacker threatening to release the footage if she went to police after her release.
During that time, Quinn received text messages demanding money for her return.
Huskins was released two days later near her childhood home in Huntington Beach. She thought her ordeal was over. Instead, she was accused of an elaborate hoax.
Quinn's ex-fiancee told authorities that she and Quinn had discussed getting back together. With this information, authorities accused Huskins of staging her kidnapping, likening the events to the plot of ""Gone Girl,"" a movie in which a small-town wife stages her own murder to get back at her cheating husband.

In a press conference after Huskins' safe reemergence, a Vallejo Police Department spokesperson publicly accused the couple of a hoax.
""Mr. Quinn and Ms. Huskins have plundered valuable resources away from our community and taken the focus away from the true victims of our community while instilling fear among our community members,"" Vallejo Lt. Kenny Park said at the time, ABC News reported. ""So, if anything, it is Mr. Quinn and Ms. Huskins that owe this community an apology.""

Huskins told Netflix the department's reaction was baffling.
""It didn’t make any sense to have law enforcement — the people who have the power to investigate and to help — just turn against you. It made it that much more frightening,"" she told a reporter with Tudum, Netflix's companion site.
""It was just layers upon layers, and then finding out what evidence they had at the time that they did not use, they could have saved me. There was just so many layers of betrayal and injustice.""Amid the media circus that followed, Quinn and Huskins told filmmakers they feared losing their jobs as physical therapists in the aftermath. ""You go through something like that, and every moment, every ounce of energy is about, 'How do I live to see another second?' That is all you can think about,"" Huskins told ABC News in footage sampled by the docuseries. ""The last thing that you're thinking about is, 'If I do survive, I need to make sure that I'm believable.'""
Huskins and Quinn told filmmakers Misty Carausu, a rookie detective who solved the case, was their hero. On June 5, 2015, a couple woke in the middle of the night to a near-identical home invasion. An intruder was standing over their bed shining a light on their faces.
While the wife hid in a bathroom and called police, her husband managed to fight off the attacker. But he left crucial evidence behind: zip-ties, duct tape, a glove and a cellphone.
Carausu traced the phone to the stepfather of a man named Matthew Muller, a Harvard-educated immigration attorney and Marine veteran.
After reaching out to police departments in the Bay Area, NBC Bay Area reported, she learned that he had been a suspect in a 2009 Palo Alto home invasion. Also at the scene were a pair of swimming goggles blacked out with duct tape that had a blonde hair attached.
SUSPECTED SERIAL KILLER REX HEUERMANN'S LAWYER DEFENDS 'SADISTIC' INTERNET SEARCHES IN GILGO BEACH CASE
At that point, Carausu contacted the FBI. Muller was arrested for the Dublin, California, home invasion June 8.
Evidence in his home, including Quinn's laptop, finally linked him to Huskins' kidnapping. Muller's confession matched Quinn and Huskins' stories perfectly, down to the audio recordings, blacked-out goggles and liquid sedatives.
He pleaded guilty to one count of federal kidnapping in September 2016 and was sentenced to 40 years behind bars. Muller also faced state charges for burglary, robbery, kidnapping and two counts of rape by force.But he was deemed incompetent to stand trial for those charges in November 2020, according to the documentary. Muller allegedly suffered from ""Gulf War illness"" after his military service, and his attorney claimed he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, NBC News reported. To this day, Huskins and Quinn told People, they have no idea why Muller targeted them.
""Like many victims, or many people who have gone through tragedy, you don't get all the answers,"" Quinn told the magazine. ""And that can be a sticking point to recovery. So, for us, we don't rely on finding those answers, but what we have to do is move forward in the unknown and focus on things that matter the most to us, like our family, our kids, our work. Those are sustainable things. And having the answers of why they targeted us doesn't change what we do as far as moving forward.""

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis promised voters in 2020 not to date any of her subordinates, according to newly unearthed footage.
The footage, first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, shows Willis saying it would be ""inappropriate"" for her to have a relationship with one of her staffers. Willis is now being accused of an improper relationship with one of her prosecutors, whom she is also accused of overpaying.
""I will certainly not be choosing to date people that work under me,"" Willis said on the ""The Patricia Crayton Show"" in April 2020.
""We are at a place in society where things happen in people’s relationships – husbands and wives sometimes, there are outside relationships. I don’t think that that’s what the community is concerned about. Although there might be a moral breaking in that,"" she continued.

""I think that what citizens are really, really concerned about is if you chose to have inappropriate contact with employees,"" she continued. ""There’s nothing I can say on it other than that it is distracting, it is certainly inappropriate for the No. 1 law officer in this state, and it really, really saddens me.""
Willis is now being accused of having an improper romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she appointed to prosecute the election interference case against former President Donald Trump.

President Jimmy Carter granted an unconditional and controversial pardon to the many thousands of men who dodged the U.S. military draft during the Vietnam War on this day in history, Jan. 21, 1977.
Ahead of the 1976 presidential election, then-candidate Carter promised to pardon those who evaded the draft as a way to close the nation's book on Vietnam.
The day after his inauguration, Carter kept his word — and pardoned draft dodgers who had not committed violent offenses.
ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, JANUARY 20, 1930, BUZZ ALDRIN IS BORN, MOON WALKER TAUGHT US THAT ‘SKY IS NOT THE LIMIT’
Carter's presidential proclamation read, in part, ""Acting pursuant to the grant of authority in Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution of the United States, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States, do hereby grant a full, complete and unconditional pardon to: (1) all persons who may have committed any offense between August 4, 1964, and March 28, 1973, in violation of the Military Selective Service Act or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder; and (2) all persons heretofore convicted, irrespective of the date of conviction, of any offense committed between August 4, 1964, and March 28, 1973, in violation of the Military Selective Service Act, or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, restoring to them full political, civil and other rights.""

Carter said during the presidential campaign that a pardon was needed ""to heal our country after the Vietnam War.""
He also said that while disagreements remained, ""we can now agree to respect those differences and to forget them.""
However — many people did not forget ""those differences.""

The American Legion, among many other groups, ""had been vocal in its opposition to any form of amnesty granted to anyone who dodged the draft while others went to war,"" as the organization has noted on its website.
THE AMERICAN LEGION TURNS 103: A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE ORGANIZATION FORMED TO AID WORLD WAR I VETERANS
""Carter had outlined his plan to pardon the violators at the 1976 American Legion National Convention in Seattle. The Legionnaires, many of whom booed the announcement, were adamantly opposed and explored possible legal and constitutional violations of such a pardon,"" the group notes.

After Carter issued his pardon, ""American Legion leaders warned what such a move would mean for national security in the event of a future draft.""
Added the Legion on its site, ""The wartime veterans of the organization had argued … that no pardons should be granted, hearkening to the same position of the World War I American Legion founders who demanded justice for ‘alien slackers’ who lived in the United States but used their foreign citizenship to escape conscription during the Great War.""
During the late 1960s to early 1970s, some 100,000 young Americans left the country to avoid serving in the war, according to History.com.
About 1,000 Americans deserted the Armed Forces and also headed to Canada.
Ninety percent of them flocked to Canada — where they were eventually welcomed as immigrants.
Other people hid inside the United States.

While the Canadian government had the right to prosecute these deserters, they were often left alone.
After the war ended, the U.S. government continued to prosecute draft dodgers until a total of 209,517 men were formally accused of dodging the draft.

While veterans groups criticized him for letting evaders off the hook, amnesty groups were angry that he did not include others who had been prosecuted — such as deserters, soldiers who were dishonorably discharged and civilian anti-war demonstrators, History.com noted.

The U.S. Army has promoted over 10,000 noncommissioned officers (NCO) over the last two years who have yet to complete the required military education and training academies, according to a report.
Since enacting a temporary pandemic-era policy in 2021 that allowed NCOs to be promoted without the courses, the Army has promoted about 52,000 NCOs, but about 20%, or 10,588, have yet to complete their courses to retain their new rank, according to Army data obtained by Military.com.
If the courses were not completed within a year of being promoted, the NCOs were supposed to lose their rank. But the outlet reported that the Army did not want to issue such a large number of demotions at one time.
The Army told Fox News Digital in an emailed statement that it is conducting a review of the matter.

""We are conducting a review of all Soldiers with exceptions to the STEP [Select, Train, Educate and Promote Policy] policy prior to suspension,"" the statement said. ""As we align policies we will ensure that we are taking care of Soldiers, informing commanders, units and Soldiers of the changes and correcting any actions that are counter to the suspension of the STEP policy.""
NCOs have faced significant difficulties in scheduling time for the required schools, where courses can last at least a month, due to limited slots and constant deployments, according to the outlet.

In September, the Army issued a news release detailing how it will reinstate its ""Select, Train, Educate and Promote"" policy for the following January, again requiring NCOs to complete professional military education training courses before they can be promoted.
The decision, however, was reversed in December. The Army told the outlet that there was no timeline for the policy’s reinstatement.

Germany’s right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party was met with massive crowds of protesters Saturday, after a report revealed it had discussed deporting millions of immigrants, including German citizens, late last year.
Investigative journalism group Correctiv published a report Wednesday on the meeting between AfD and the Identitarian Movement (IM) in November, claiming IM member Martin Sellner presented a plan for ""re-migration"" of immigrants out of Germany, including those who already have citizenship, but have failed to integrate.
AfD has confirmed the meeting, which was allegedly captured on hidden cameras, took place but rejected assertions that it reflects their party policy.
""The AfD won't change its position on immigration policy because of a single opinion at a non-AfD meeting,"" a spokesperson told Reuters.

Protesters across Germany held signs on Saturday that read ""Never Again is Now,"" ""Defend Democracy"" and ""Against Hate"" as the meeting garners comparisons with the Nazis.
A protest in Frankfurt on Saturday had around 35,000 people and one in Hamburg had around 50,000, police said. Others took place in cities like Stuttgart, Nuremberg and Hannover.
Hamburg’s demonstration ended early over crowd size safety concerns.

Large protests in cities like Berlin and Munich are also planned for Sunday.
The report and subsequent protests have also renewed calls for a ban on the AfD in the country.

The AfD was founded in 2013 and polling suggests it has around 23% support in the country.
AfD was the first right-wing party since the Nazis to win a mayoral and district council election when it did last year. It has also made significant gains in state elections in Bavaria and Hesse.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz condemned the AfD and Identarian Movement in a statement on social media last week, comparing them to the Third Reich.
""We protect everyone — regardless of origin, skin color or how uncomfortable someone is for fanatics with assimilation fantasies,"" said Scholz.

A convicted killer was allegedly lunged at and punched in a California courtroom during his sentencing for stabbing his girlfriend to death nearly four years ago.
Euren Balbuena, 33, was sentenced to 33 years to life in prison for killing his girlfriend, 31-year-old Zaira Patino-Trejo, Ventura County District Attorney Erik Nasarenko announced in a Thursday press release.
According to the Ventura Star, citing Joey Buttitta, a spokesperson for the Ventura County District Attorney’s Office, a ""brief altercation"" happened as the emotional victim impact statements were being read in court.
