The President of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe, Marc Cools, has made the following statement:
"I am appalled by what appears to be the deadliest Russian attack on Ukrainian civilians perpetrated today in Poltava. On behalf of the Congress, I condemn in the strongest terms today's missile attack which caused a massive loss of life and left hundreds injured.
"We grieve with the people and authorities of Poltava, a long-standing Congress partner, and with Congress Vice-President Oksana Derkach, member of Poltava's Municipal Assembly. We express our solidarity with Ukraine's citizens and local authorities who are always the first to face the horrors of senseless and cruel bombing campaigns by the Russian aggressor. We pledge to continue supporting municipalities and regions of Ukraine including through the Cities4Cities/United4Ukraine online platform."
