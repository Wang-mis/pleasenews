Vladimir Putin toured the corvette Rezky and viewed information stands about the development of the naval base.
The Rezky is the fourth ship in a series of Project 20380 multipurpose patrol corvettes built at the Amur Shipyard for the Pacific Fleet. It went on duty in September 2023.
The Pacific Fleet's Primorye Flotilla of All-Arms Forces was established in 1979 and is the largest group within the Russian Navy.
Commander of the Pacific Fleet Viktor Liina, Commander of the Primorye Flotilla Alexei Sysuyev and commander of the corvette Rezky Yevgeny Kovalev provided explanations of the processes to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief.
Before visiting the base, Vladimir Putin travelled by boat to the site in Promezhutochnaya Bay where a new shipyard is to be built by 2031. The President assigned the implementation of the project to VTB Bank and the United Shipbuilding Corporation. The future shipyard will mostly build commercial vessels such as bulkers, tankers, container carriers and LNG carriers. The site's proximity to the city of Vladivostok ensures a readily available workforce. Other advantages include road, railway and engineering infrastructure, potential access to gas supply and a possibility to increase energy capacity.
The President was accompanied by First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov, Primorye Territory Governor Oleg Kozhemyako, President and Chairman of VTB Bank Management Board Andrei Kostin, and Director General of the United Shipbuilding Corporation Andrei Puchkov.
