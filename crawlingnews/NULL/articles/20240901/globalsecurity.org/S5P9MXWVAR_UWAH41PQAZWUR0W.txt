Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi has called for a complete arms embargo on the criminal Israeli regime.
Safadi on Tuesday praised the British government over its decision to partially suspend some arms export licenses to Israel, calling for a complete weapons embargo on the Tel Aviv regime.
Amid criticisms of the UK's indirect involvement in the Israeli genocide of the helpless Palestinian people trapped in the Gaza Strip, the UK on Monday suspended 30 of its 350 arms export licenses.
"The UK did right to suspend some arms exports licenses to Israel," Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said on X, formerly twitter.
"We urge an expansion of this suspension and call on all countries to impose a complete arms embargo on Israel."
"Unless consequences are real, (Israeli prime minister Benjamin) Netanyahu will not end his aggression on Gaza and the West Bank, and will not stop violating intentional law and threatening the security of the whole region," Safadi said.
Jordan's Prime Minister Bisher al Khasawaneh had announced earlier this year that peace with the Israelis remained to be a strategic choice for Amman, in complete disregard for the genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza.
Israel has killed over 40,800 Palestinians in Gaza since October 2023.
