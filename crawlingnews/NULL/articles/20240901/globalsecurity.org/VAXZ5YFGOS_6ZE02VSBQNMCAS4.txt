Question: You have said that the atmosphere is great. The EU and the US have expressed concern that Mongolia is receiving President Putin.
Sergey Lavrov: I pity them if they are concerned with such a good occasion. Two neighbours, two countries that fought side-by-side during WWII. We were allies with Mongolia at the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, and Mongolia was our ally in the Great Patriotic War.
If people raise questions about our close ties, then perhaps these are the people who have allowed Nazi undertones slip through again. And not just in their remarks, but in actions through their support of the Kiev regime.
