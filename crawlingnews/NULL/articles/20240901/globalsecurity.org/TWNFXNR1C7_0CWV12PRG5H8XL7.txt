President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Taoiseach of Ireland Simon Harris signed an Agreement on Support for Ukraine and Cooperation between the two countries.
Since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion, Ireland has   provided humanitarian, stabilization, and non-lethal military aid to   Ukraine, totaling approximately â¬380 million.
This year, Ireland has committed to providing an additional â¬128   million in non-lethal military support and at least â¬40 million in   humanitarian aid to Ukraine.
Ireland will also supply mine clearance systems and explosive   ordnance disposal equipment, continuing its involvement in the demining   coalition. Additionally, Ireland will explore other potential support   pathways within the capability coalitions of the Ukraine Defense Contact   Group, such as the IT Coalition.
Ireland will ensure the ongoing training of the Ukrainian Armed Forces through EUMAM Ukraine.
Separate sections of the agreement outline humanitarian aid, as well   as support for Ukraine's recovery and reform efforts, particularly on   the path toward EU membership. Ireland will assist in holding Russia   accountable, compensating for damages caused by the aggression, and   further strengthening sanctions pressure on Russia.
Moreover, Ireland will continue its diplomatic efforts to implement   the Peace Formula and participate in the activities of various working   groups and implementation of specific elements of the Formula, including   the International Coalition for the Return of Ukrainian Children.
In total, Ukraine has already signed 26 bilateral agreements in   furtherance of the G7 Joint Declaration adopted in Vilnius on July 12,   2023.
