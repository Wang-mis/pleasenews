Dear Ukrainians!
Today - Zaporizhzhia. Together with the Prime Minister of the   Netherlands. An important visit, and a very symbolic one - on the very   day the school year begins.
Just now, here in Khortytsia, we spoke with our veterans, veterans of   the war. Today, in Zaporizhzhia, we also presented our Mriia - a new   educational application. It is actually an analog of Diia for our   Ukrainian education, for all our children, for teachers, for parents.   This is an undeniably good result: in times of such war, Ukraine is   both: defending itself and developing - creating new products, providing   opportunities for our people. I thank the entire Mriia team and all our   Ukrainian teachers, everyone who works to strengthen education in   Ukraine. And we are adding guarantees to this. The Government of Ukraine   has clear instructions on the construction of shelters and the   provision of buses for schools - we must fulfill what we promised our   communities. We are also creating a program of guaranteed free meals for   children in primary school - from first to fourth grade. And also, the   Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Education, regional   administrations, the Ministry of Digital Transformation, communities   must ensure the full implementation of our Safe School program - which   means creating a truly reliable safe space for all students, for every   school.
This year, schools for offline learning have opened in Zaporizhzhia   and in many other cities and communities. More than two million children   will be able to study in the basic school format. Another million   children will study in a mixed format: both offline and online. All of   this depends on safety factors. On the availability of shelters in our   schools and on our overall ability to protect lives.
Today, during our negotiations with the Prime Minister of the   Netherlands, we talked about exactly that - about strengthening air   defense, about new air defense systems, and about missiles for them.   About F-16s for Ukraine. And about all the necessary weapons for our   defense against the Russian occupier. Shells for warriors, equipment.   And the protection of life throughout the country, including the   protection of our energy sector. Today we have a new aid package from   the Netherlands - thank you for that. We have also talked about the   Netherlands becoming a patron of Zaporizhzhia - this is infrastructure,   this is protection of normal life, this is humanitarian issues. This is   something that will definitely help Ukraine. And we appreciate all the   support of the people of the Netherlands, Prime Minister Schoof   personally, and all the political and public figures from the   Netherlands.
And of course, my greatest appreciation goes to all our people, to   everyone who protects our Ukraine, our Zaporizhzhia, all our cities and   communities. Everyone who fights for Ukraine, works here in our state,   helps us - thank you! I am proud of our people; I am proud of Ukraine!
Glory to Ukraine!
