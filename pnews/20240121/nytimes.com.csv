In recent months, however, that rule has been relaxed in two of the unlikeliest places.
Oregon and California, among the most cautious of states early in the pandemic, have surprised health officials elsewhere by breaking with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and telling infected workers and schoolchildren that as long as they have no symptoms, they are generally free to go about their lives.
The new approach has been greeted with trepidation by some health experts in the United States, especially as wastewater data shows a surge in cases driven by a new variant. But many scientists say that Covid has transitioned from a public health crisis into more of a featured virus among an array of respiratory risks.
“The emergency has ended. Covid-19 is endemic,” said Dr. Melissa Sutton, medical director for respiratory viral pathogens at the Oregon Health Authority. “We’re in a different phase.”
As vaccinations, antiviral treatments and natural immunity have reduced the mortality rate of Covid, state officials have given more consideration to the societal cost of pandemic constraints.

1A5WSEC8BV_32KPSZ6XGM904WF,Ron DeSantis Ends Campaign for President,"By Nicholas Nehamas, Maggie Haberman, Jonathan Swan and Shane GoldmacherReporting from Manchester, N.H.","Jan. 21, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/01/21/us/election-news-new-hampshire-trump/desantis-drops-out,"Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida suspended his campaign for president on Sunday and endorsed former President Donald J. Trump, marking a spectacular implosion for a candidate once seen as having the best chance to dethrone Mr. Trump as the Republican Party’s nominee in 2024.
His departure from the race just two days before the New Hampshire primary election leaves Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, as Mr. Trump’s last rival standing.
Mr. DeSantis’s devastating 30-percentage-point loss to Mr. Trump in the Iowa caucuses last Monday had left him facing a daunting question: Why keep going? On Sunday, he provided his answer, acknowledging there was no point in soldiering on without a “clear path to victory.""
“I am today suspending my campaign,” Mr. DeSantis said in a video posted after The New York Times reported he was expected to leave the race, adding: “Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden. That is clear. I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear.”

42X0GFMKDE_YIXMD0F12NN2MUX,"Netanyahu Restates Opposition to Two-State Solution, Despite Pressure From Biden",By Adam RasgonReporting from Jerusalem,"Published Jan. 21, 2024Updated Jan. 22, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/01/21/world/israel-hamas-gaza-news-iraq/netanyahu-rebuffs-biden-again-on-the-idea-of-creating-a-palestinian-state,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel doubled down on his opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state this weekend, again rebuffing pressure from President Biden to agree to that path after the war in Gaza is over.
“My insistence is what has prevented — over the years — the establishment of a Palestinian state that would have constituted an existential danger to Israel,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement in Hebrew on Sunday. “As long as I am prime minister, I will continue to strongly insist on this.”
The statement reiterated comments he made on social media the previous day, when he said in Hebrew that he “will not compromise on full Israeli security control of the entire area west of the Jordan River — and that is irreconcilable with a Palestinian state.”
Mr. Netanyahu’s comments came after Mr. Biden spoke to him on Friday about a two-state solution and floated the possibility of a disarmed Palestinian nation that would not threaten Israel’s security. Mr. Biden has argued that the creation of a Palestinian state is the only viable long-term resolution to a conflict that has dragged on for decades, repeating a position held by most American presidents and European leaders in recent history.
While there was no indication that Mr. Netanyahu would ease his strenuous opposition, which is popular with his fragile right-wing political coalition, Mr. Biden had expressed optimism that they might yet find consensus.
“There are a number of types of two-state solutions,” the president told reporters at the White House several hours after Friday’s call, their first in nearly a month amid tension over the war. “There’s a number of countries that are members of the U.N. that are still — don’t have their own militaries. Number of states that have limitations.” He added, “And so I think there’s ways in which this could work.”

6EONB33ZZ2_8IDAB6KG4DFH7F1,"As Trump Treats Trials Like Rallies, Judges Study How to Rein Him In",By Benjamin Weiser and Jonah E. Bromwich,"Jan. 21, 2024",20240114,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/nyregion/trump-trial-judge-campaign.html,"Donald J. Trump doesn’t change. Judges do.
Two weeks ago, a New York judge, Arthur F. Engoron, permitted Mr. Trump to personally deliver a closing argument in his civil fraud trial as long as he stuck to the facts and avoided a courtroom “campaign speech.” Mr. Trump bulldozed through the restrictions, repeated his familiar claim of a “political witch hunt” and assailed the judge to his face.
Then last week, after a lawyer down the street at the E. Jean Carroll defamation trial complained that Mr. Trump was grumbling “con job” and “witch hunt” loud enough for jurors to hear, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan sternly warned him that, although he had the right to be present, “that right can be forfeited — and it can be forfeited if he is disruptive.”
Ms. Carroll’s lawyers did not find reason to complain again.
The judges’ different approaches to the tempestuous storm that entered their courtrooms — and the different results — could offer lessons beyond the two New York cases. They may provide guidance for the judges set to oversee Mr. Trump’s four potential criminal trials, who will want to keep the 45th president from transforming his legal proceedings into political spectacles.
“The thing you’ve got to do primarily is set rules and enforce them,” said John S. Martin Jr., a former U.S. District Court judge in Manhattan. “I think if the judge is tough and doesn’t back down, Trump will back down.”

7WGVGL49MU_GGNQD2ME2MYKEP1,Only Voters Can Truly Disqualify Trump,_,"Jan. 21, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/opinion/trump-section-3-sovereignty.html,"Intense debate has accompanied the decision by the Supreme Court to review the decision by Colorado’s highest court to bar Donald Trump from the state’s primary ballots based on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment — about the precise meaning of the word “insurrection,” the extent of Mr. Trump’s culpability for the events of Jan. 6 and other legal issues.
I’m not going to predict how the Supreme Court will rule, or whether its ruling will be persuasive to those with a different view of the law. But there’s a critical philosophical question that lies beneath the legal questions in this case. In a representative democracy, the people are sovereign, and they express their sovereignty through representatives of their choice. If the courts presume to pre-emptively reject the people’s choice, then who is truly sovereign?
The question of sovereignty was central to the purpose of the 14th Amendment in the first place. The Civil War — unquestionably an armed insurrection — was fought because of slavery. That was the reason for the war.
But its justification was a dispute over sovereignty, whether it resided primarily with the people of the individual states or with the people of the United States, who had established the Constitution.
The answer was settled on the battlefield, but it was ratified through the 14th Amendment, which defined who is a citizen of the United States and established that the “privileges or immunities” of same supersede any state laws that might abridge them. From now on, there would be no ambiguity: Under the Constitution, the people of the United States are sovereign, and this sovereignty supersedes the sovereignty of the people of the individual states whenever the privileges and immunities of the former are in conflict with the will of the latter.
Section 3 of that amendment was similarly enacted in order to secure federal supremacy. Rebel officers might well have retained strong popular support in the former Confederate states, but Section 3 prevented the rebellion from being continued by electoral means. The people of South Carolina might prefer to be represented by former rebels, but the people of the United States, whose sovereignty trumps South Carolina’s, forbid it.
Whose sovereignty, though, trumps the people as a whole?
Donald Trump is the overwhelming favorite to win the Republican nomination for president and has a close to even-odds chance of winning the general election. That would seem to have no bearing on his eligibility to run. If a majority of the country wanted Barack Obama or Arnold Schwarzenegger or Selena Gomez to be president, it would be out of luck. The Constitution renders them ineligible: Mr. Obama has already been elected twice, Mr. Schwarzenegger was not born a U.S. citizen and Ms. Gomez is under 35 years old.
For that very reason, though, those individuals aren’t likely to run — and if they did try to run, their ineligibility would be manifest, recognized by everyone. Similarly, former Confederate officers and officials, by serving in the Confederacy, had explicitly declared themselves insurrectionists. Congress passed a broad amnesty in 1872 to lift the penalties associated with the involvement of most in insurrection, including that imposed by Section 3 of the 14th Amendment; some individuals not covered by the amnesty petitioned successfully for the restoration of their civil rights, and in other cases the prohibition was simply not enforced. But the essential fact of participation in the insurrection was not in dispute.
The situation with Mr. Trump could not be more different. An overwhelming majority of his party, and apparently about half of the country as a whole, considers him to be eligible to be president again. Moreover, these voters believe this even though, as President Biden said recently, “we saw with our own eyes” what happened on Jan. 6.
I count myself among those who consider Mr. Trump to be manifestly unfit to serve in any office ever again because of his actions on that day, even if he is not held criminally liable. But being unfit is not the same thing as being ineligible. What makes the Colorado Supreme Court — or any court — believe that it has a privileged understanding of those events that is beyond the capacity of the public to discern?
Perhaps the public is misinformed, or refuses to let itself be accurately informed, even at this late date, about what happened. The need for expertise and deliberation is why we have a representative democracy; the people do not act directly to make laws, but act through their representatives.
It’s notable in that regard, then, that impeachment — the remedy the Constitution provides for a president who violates his oath of office — does not involve the courts but the people, acting through their representatives. And the court of the people already had the opportunity to weigh in on Mr. Trump’s culpability for the events of Jan. 6. He was impeached an unprecedented second time by the House of Representatives for his actions on that day. But in the trial that followed in the Senate, Mr. Trump was acquitted.
That does not mean he is innocent. But it does mean that the Colorado Supreme Court has, in effect, declared that it outranks the Senate, and can overrule that body’s decision.
Some Republican senators, including the minority leader, Mitch McConnell, effectively asked the courts to do just that during the impeachment debate. Arguing that they had no authority to try a president whose term had ended, they refused to consider the facts of the case. But this was not a principled view. The Senate had already voted separately on the question of jurisdiction, and a majority determined that they did have the ability to try a president whose term had ended. Once that question was settled by the Senate itself, senators who thought Mr. Trump was guilty, including those who voted the other way on the jurisdictional question, could vote their consciences on the matter at trial.
Since the senators still voted to acquit, it must be because they did not think he was guilty, or did not deserve punishment for his guilt. Or, reflecting gross cowardice, perhaps they did not want the responsibility for convicting him, and preferred the courts to shoulder that responsibility instead.
That’s precisely what the Colorado Supreme Court has decided to do. But in so doing, it has usurped the proper prerogative of the people. It is saying, in so many words, that the people’s representatives got it wrong in the impeachment trial, and the people themselves are incapable of seeing what is in front of their eyes. Therefore the court must save the people from the possibility of making a catastrophically wrong decision.
Democracy cannot be saved in this fashion, not even from the threat of a demagogue with contempt for the rule of law. It can be saved only by democratic means. If the people’s representatives failed to do their duty, as they did in Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial, the last line of democracy’s defense is the sovereign people themselves. At the point that we cannot trust them, democracy is dead already.

His hands gripped the steering wheel of his rental car. He was dressed head to toe in white linen, his body glowing in an almost celestial way, as he drove toward the Oklahoma State Penitentiary.
Moss, a chaplain, had spent the year working as the spiritual adviser to Phillip Hancock, a death row inmate in Oklahoma. The morning of the November execution had arrived. The prison had brought Hancock the wrong last meal the night before, white meat from Kentucky Fried Chicken instead of dark.
“That chicken, I know,” echoed Sue Hosch, an anti-death penalty activist seated in the passenger seat beside Moss. “I couldn’t believe it.”
Hancock, convicted of two murders he committed in 2001, was scheduled to be executed at 10 a.m. With three hours to go, his lawyers were still hoping that Oklahoma’s governor would grant him clemency, as the state parole board had voted to recommend three weeks earlier.

“It is rather unusual in bringing impacts to most of the U.K.,” Grahame Madge, a spokesman for the weather service, said of the fading system called Storm Isha.
Forecasters had issued a yellow weather warning until midday. The warning is routinely used when people are at risk from certain weather because of their location or activity, and it advises the public “to take preventative action,” according to the meteorological office’s website.
Late on Sunday night, the Met Office issued a red wind warning for overnight covering the northeast coast of Scotland and advised people not to use the roadways. A red warning advises the public to expect “a short spell of extremely strong winds leading to danger to life, structural damage and disruption.”

ATJ7FXOL9T_W792RP4AZXCPDUG,The Hottest Buzzword in Wellness Seeps Into Real Estate,By Jane Margolies,"Jan. 21, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/business/blue-zones-homes-builders.html,"As the director of online sales for the builder CC Homes, Lorraine Sanchez encourages prospective buyers to go see the company’s houses in Ave Maria, a town in southwest Florida.
Since last year, she has had a new marketing tool: Ave Maria is “certified” as a blue zone, a place geared to helping people live healthy, active lives.
“It’s a great selling point,” Ms. Sanchez said.
The term “blue zone” was coined two decades ago when Dan Buettner, an explorer for National Geographic, was investigating places around the world where people regularly lived to 100 and beyond. He deduced that residents of these mostly small, remote locales had such long, healthy lives because they stayed active, ate plant-based meals and formed lasting social ties, among other practices.
The concept has become the latest wellness buzzword: Blue Zones, the company that sprang from Mr. Buettner’s research, has put its trademark on books, canned beans, bottled tea, frozen burrito bowls and even a series on Netflix.

C25HDCX67Q_8LMCSVUM6FJC7PV,Dean Phillips Floats a No Labels Bid if 2024 Is Trump vs. Biden,"By Reid J. EpsteinReporting from a Dean Phillips campaign stop in Nashua, N.H.","Jan. 20, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/20/us/politics/dean-phillips-no-labels-biden.html,"Representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota, a Democrat running a long-shot primary challenge to President Biden, said on Saturday that he would consider running on the ticket of No Labels, a centrist group exploring an independent bid, if it appeared the general election would be a rematch between Mr. Biden and Donald J. Trump.
In an interview, Mr. Phillips publicly articulated for the first time the circumstances in which he would accept the No Labels presidential nomination, and said he was in regular communication with Nancy Jacobson, the group’s chief executive. Democratic allies of Mr. Biden have been alarmed by No Labels, worrying that any candidate it runs could siphon votes from him.
“People are criticizing them because they believe whomever they offer on their ticket will hurt Joe Biden,” Mr. Phillips said after a town-hall event at a senior center in Nashua, N.H. “That’s false. If they put someone at the top of the ticket who could actually drive votes from Donald Trump, every Democrat in the United States of America should be celebrating it. They haven’t made that determination.”
Mr. Phillips has a long relationship with Ms. Jacobson and No Labels from his tenure in the group’s congressional Problem Solvers Caucus, an organization that promotes policies with bipartisan support. He said he had told Ms. Jacobson he would not discuss running as the No Labels candidate “at this time.”
But Mr. Phillips did say he would consider running as the No Labels candidate if polling suggested that Mr. Biden would lose in November to Mr. Trump.
“It would have to be a Joe Biden-Donald Trump rematch that shows Joe Biden is almost certain to lose,” Mr. Phillips said. “That is the only condition in which I would even entertain a conversation with any alternative.”

EAX4819H0C_3O7QWJ0FBQZF876,Why This Presidential Front-Runner Is Stirring Fears of the ‘Death of Democracy’,"By Sui-Lee WeeReporting from Jakarta, Indonesia","Jan. 21, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/world/asia/prabowo-human-rights-indonesia-election.html,"He hoped to succeed Indonesia’s longtime dictator. He ordered the kidnappings of pro-democracy activists. He was accused of atrocities during the ruthless military occupation of East Timor. He has said elections run counter to his country’s culture.
Even so, Prabowo Subianto has spent the past two decades trying his hand at democratic politics, donning different personas in multiple attempts to become Indonesia’s leader.
Now, a month before the next election, nearly every poll shows Mr. Prabowo, 72, leading in the first round of voting. His rise, with the help of a running mate who is the son of the popular departing president, Joko Widodo, has alarmed millions of Indonesians who still remember the brutal and kleptocratic rule of Suharto, Mr. Prabowo’s former boss and father-in-law.
A victory for Mr. Prabowo, his critics warn, would revive a dark past.
“What will happen is the death of democracy,” said Hendardi, the director of the Setara Institute for Democracy and Peace. Like many Indonesians, he goes by one name. “We have long been against Prabowo,” he added, “and with our limited power, we were still able to prevent him from moving forward. But now he has gained this support.”
On the campaign trail, Mr. Prabowo, who is the current defense minister, has dismissed concerns about his track record.
But he has continued to display his strongman bona fides. At a presidential debate this month, Mr. Prabowo talked about the need to develop a strong military, saying without it, a nation “will be crushed,” just as in Gaza today.
He is in a three-way race with Anies Baswedan, the former governor of Jakarta, and Ganjar Pranowo, who ran Central Java.
To win outright on Feb. 14, Mr. Prabowo would need to clinch at least 51 percent of the vote. Surveys show that he is far ahead of his rivals, but his support tops off around 46 percent, implying he will probably be forced into a runoff in June and likely to face stiffer competition.
For years, a Prabowo presidency was considered a remote possibility in Indonesia, one of Southeast Asia’s most vibrant democracies.
To many Indonesians, Mr. Prabowo is a symbol of the 32-year reign of Suharto. Following Suharto’s 1998 ouster, he was discharged from the Indonesian military after the armed forces found he was involved in the abduction and torture of pro-democracy activists. More than a dozen remain missing and are feared dead.
Ucok Munandar Siahaan was a 21-year-old student when he vanished on May 15, 1998. His father, Paian Siahaan, 76, discovered later that he had been helping detained anti-government activists. For decades, he has been pressing the authorities for answers.
Every night, Mr. Paian said he prayed the same prayer: “God, please save him.” In recent months, he has added another one: that Mr. Prabowo would not become president.
“In my mind, he will not be elected because of our prayers, the prayers of the oppressed people,” he said.
Mr. Prabowo’s record on human rights — which also includes accusations that his feared Kopassus special forces slaughtered hundreds in a crackdown in East Timor — led the United States to bar him from entering the country for years.
He was never charged in a criminal court.
In 2014, he presented himself as a military strongman, bellowing nationalistic speeches, but lost to Mr. Joko. Five years later, Mr. Prabowo portrayed himself as a devout Muslim and leaned on communal dog whistles, accusing Mr. Joko of secretly being a “Chinese Christian.” He failed again but claimed that he was a victim of election fraud and rallied hardline Islamists to protest the results in violent street demonstrations. (Indonesia has the world’s biggest Muslim population.)
In this campaign, Mr. Prabowo has tried to shed his reputation for a volatile temper by portraying himself as a gemoy, or cute, grandfather who dances at rallies. And he has implicitly won the backing of Mr. Joko by naming his 36-year-old son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, as his running mate. Billboards all over Indonesia show cartoons of a doe-eyed and chubby Mr. Prabowo together with Mr. Gibran.
Mr. Prabowo was not available to comment, said Budiman Sudjatmiko, the deputy chairman of the Prabowo-Gibran campaign team advisory board, who was once a fierce critic of Mr. Prabowo. The presidential hopeful, he said, had “learned a lot” from being surrounded by Mr. Joko and his supporters.
“He’s no longer in military service, so he should play a role as a civilian politician — reachable, accessible and more friendly,” said Mr. Budiman, who was a political prisoner under the Suharto regime.
This makeover has found traction among Indonesia’s youth, the country’s largest voting bloc. People under 30 did not grow up under Suharto, and many know little about the horrors of his regime because they are not covered in the country’s textbooks.
A post shared by Prabowo Subianto (@prabowo)
For Defi Afra, a 21-year-old first-time voter who has seen videos of Mr. Prabowo on TikTok, “He is a funny, humorous figure. He also seems nice and kind.”
Ms. Defi, a student in the city of Yogyakarta, said she only recently learned of Mr. Prabowo’s past on social media. But she shrugged it off, saying, “He couldn’t refuse orders from his superiors.”
The rehabilitation of Mr. Prabowo’s image began years ago, when Mr. Joko appointed him to be defense minister. He emerged as a moderate politician loyal to Mr. Joko, who was known for his down-to-earth style and ability to work with politicians from different parties. The appointment also allowed Mr. Prabowo to re-enter the United States.
But Mr. Prabowo’s tenure in that job has been marred by setbacks, including a failed effort to buy secondhand fighter jets and a botched food security program.
Mr. Joko initially appeared to support his party’s candidate, Mr. Ganjar, the former Central Java official. Then in October, Mr. Gibran joined Mr. Prabowo’s ticket. The alliance, critics say, is an effort by Mr. Joko to increase his influence on Indonesian politics by grooming his son for the presidency. For now, it has pushed Mr. Prabowo’s popularity even higher.
“It is very depressing,” said Goenawan Mohamad, the founder of Tempo, a prominent investigative magazine.
Mr. Prabowo, according to Mr. Budiman, wants an Indonesia that is “more just and more fair socioeconomically,” pointing to his proposal of free milk in schools and plan to transform Indonesia, whose economy is driven by commodities, into a “digital nation.”
Mr. Prabowo was born to one of Indonesia’s most prominent political families. His father, Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, fled Indonesia in the 1950s after he was accused of supporting a rebellion against the government. Mr. Prabowo spent his early years in England and Switzerland and later attended Indonesia’s military academy. In the 1980s, he married a daughter of Suharto, though they separated about 15 years later.
He is thought to have amassed a fortune of about $130 million, according to local news media reports. His brother Hashim Djojohadikusumo, a tycoon himself, helped set up the Gerindra Party in the late 2000s, which has become the vehicle for Mr. Prabowo’s political ambitions.
In June, he laid out why he was vying again for the presidency.
“I feel that God has given me many blessings, benefits and advantages,” he told a television host. “I have been given the opportunity to understand the problem of this nation.”
But many villagers across Indonesia have a different view. In 2020, Mr. Joko put Mr. Prabowo in charge of a program aimed at curbing the country’s reliance on food imports.
In the village of Desa Talekung Punei, the government said it wanted to clear about 20,000 acres of forest land to grow rice. There were no feasibility studies done to see if the soil was suitable for growing rice, according to Ihwan, a resident and activist for a nonprofit group.
Residents resisted the plan, saying they relied on the forest for their livelihoods. Still, the Defense Ministry sent in teams to clear tracts of land. When the seeds arrived, they had expired and were infested with bugs, Ihwan said. The land now sits abandoned.

It has since allowed limited amounts of aid into the enclave through two border points, one in Israel and the other in Egypt, but those deliveries have been bogged down by inspections and logistical snarls.
Humanitarian workers say vastly more aid is needed to meaningfully help Gaza’s 2.2 million residents amid dire shortages of food, water and supplies.
Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken pressed Israeli officials about allowing Gaza aid through the port of Ashdod when he was in Tel Aviv earlier this month, according to one U.S. official. That official and the others interviewed about the new aid proposal spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations.
Under the new proposed agreement, aid would be shipped from Cyprus — an Israeli ally — to Ashdod, three of the officials said. From Ashdod, it would then be transported to Kerem Shalom, the Israeli border crossing through which aid has been allowed into Gaza, a European official said.
The ultimate goal, an American and a European official said, is to establish a workable alternative to delivering aid via Egypt in a way that satisfies Israel’s demand for security checks. Israeli officials have demanded stringent inspections on all supplies entering Gaza so as to weed out anything that could benefit Hamas.

G4X7Z5KN4J_NG4GTTMO3QT0M8A,"U.N. Chief Says Gaza Death Toll Is ‘Unacceptable’ as It Passes 25,000",By Matthew Mpoke Bigg,"Jan. 21, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/world/middleeast/gaza-death-toll-israel-war.html,"Israel’s military operation in Gaza has led to destruction and killing on a scale that is “utterly unacceptable,” the United Nations’ secretary general, António Guterres, said on Sunday as the Gazan Health Ministry said the death toll in the territory since the start of the offensive had surpassed 25,000.
Mr. Guterres called for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza that would allow aid to reach all those in need, and to facilitate the release of hostages taken during an attack on Israel led by Hamas on Oct. 7, during which the Israeli authorities say around 1,200 people were killed. More than 100 hostages remain in captivity.
In response to the Oct. 7 attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began a campaign of airstrikes in Gaza and a ground invasion in a bid to eradicate Hamas. The government also declared a siege of Gaza, which has a population of about 2.2 million people.
Israel’s government says that civilian casualties are a tragedy, but it argues that it bombards residential areas because Hamas hides its forces among the civilian population and has built an extensive network of tunnels, some of them beneath hospitals. It also says that it warns civilians to move to areas away from the fighting.
Almost all of Gaza’s population has been displaced because of Israel’s military campaign, and international groups say the aid that is making it into Gaza is a small fraction of what is necessary to stem the humanitarian crisis that has played out over the last three months.
“This is heartbreaking,” Mr. Guterres said about the loss of life. He was speaking in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, during a summit that aims to increase trade and investment between nations in parts of the world that are less economically developed.

GN4G4FV5M8_CRDN5NNAZG8QS3X,The Nicest Place on the Internet,By Deb Amlen,"Jan. 21, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/briefing/new-york-times-games-community.html,"New York Times Games — which includes the Crossword, Spelling Bee, Wordle, Connections and more — has a devoted fandom. But I think the word “community” is a better way to describe them.
I joined The Times in 2011, when Wordplay — the Crossword column I write with Sam Corbin and Caitlin Lovinger — was a blog that presented a well-written analysis of each day’s puzzle, aimed at a small but devoted readership of experienced solvers. My assignment was to bring in a wider group of readers, who might love and respect the puzzle but who thought it intimidating and intellectually out of reach. It was a shame, in my opinion, that these people, who were smart in other aspects of their lives, were missing out on the confidence-building satisfaction of conquering the puzzle and the joy of spotting clever wordplay in the clues.
So I made it my mission to find ways to smash through that intimidation barrier. I told my readers that Wordplay was a party, and that everyone was invited.
We needed to show new solvers that crossword puzzles were nothing to fear by unlocking the rules of solving them — teaching readers, for example, that a question mark at the end of a clue is an indicator that they should not take it at face value, or that the tense of an answer has to match the tense of the clue. Wordplay began talking directly to beginners, because I knew that every day new people pick up crosswords for the first time. The more experienced solvers rose to the occasion in the comments, and began helping beginners find their way.
As New York Times Games has grown, we’ve carried that sentiment forward into the communities surrounding our newer games.
Readers who comment on Wordplay, or in the forums for Spelling Bee, Connections and Wordle, are a warm and generous bunch. They greet newbies, help each other solve and even check in on one another if someone hasn’t posted in a while. They have sat down to meals in North Carolina, California and England. When members of the community die, the group mourns their loss together. That sense of community even inspired one solver to take off on a road trip to meet some Spelling Bee friends in real life. One reader commented that she thought the Wordplay column and comment section must be the nicest place on the internet. I can’t think of a higher compliment.

GYVIJ3JI4W_6QHU1LMOUDXSG3Z,At Least 72 Deaths in U.S. Are Connected to Severe Winter Weather,By Jacey Fortin and Colbi Edmonds,"Jan. 21, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/us/deaths-cold-storms-ice-snow-freeze.html,"At least 72 people across the United States have died from weather-related causes after more than a week of frigid winter storms and brutally cold temperatures, according to reports from state officials, police departments, medical examiners and news outlets.
The number is likely to grow as the authorities scramble to assess the death toll from the bitter chill, frozen roads and high winds, especially in parts of the country unused to extended bouts of a deep freeze.
On Monday in Tennessee, a man died after he fell through a skylight while clearing snow from the roof of a business. On Tuesday in Pennsylvania, five women from the same family were killed in a collision with a tractor-trailer, just moments after they had convened on the side of a snowy highway following a separate accident. And on Wednesday in Oregon, a tree branch, weakened by wind and ice, took down a live power line that killed two adults and a teenager.
Tennessee suffered a particularly high number of fatalities. At least 27 people there appear to have died of weather-related causes, including hypothermia, falls and traffic accidents, according to state health officials. And in Oregon, at least 11 people are reported to have died of weather-related causes, including the three who were killed by the power line. Both states declared a state of emergency last week, as did Kentucky, where at least five people died during the cold snap.

IE58Q0FMU8_MCM1F9KH9XPGZ4I,How Nikki Haley’s Lean Years Led Her Into an Ethical Thicket,"By Sharon LaFraniere and Alexandra BerzonSharon LaFraniere reported from Columbia, S.C. and Alexandra Berzon reported from Los Angeles.","Jan. 21, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/us/politics/nikki-haley-republican-primary-ethics-south-carolina.html,"Nikki Haley had been serving in the South Carolina legislature for less than two years when she applied for a job in late 2006 as an accounting clerk at Wilbur Smith Associates, an engineering and design firm with state contracts.
She needed work. Her parents’ clothing business, where she and her husband, Michael Haley, had both worked, was winding down. Ms. Haley was earning a salary of just $22,000 as a part-time state legislator. And her husband’s own enterprise, involving businesses swapping goods and services, was losing money.
Wilbur Smith executives regarded Ms. Haley as overqualified for the accounting job. But because of her wide-ranging network, they would later say, they put Ms. Haley on a retainer, asking her to scout out potential new business. She never found any, a top executive later said. Over the next two years, the firm paid her $48,000 for a job the executive described as “a passive position.”
That contract, and a subsequent, much more lucrative one as a fund-raiser for a prominent hospital in her home county, allowed Ms. Haley to triple her income in just three years. But they also led her into an ethical gray area that tarnished her first term as South Carolina’s governor.

IV9C3Q8PO8_9M02JO796YHF1YL,"In Frigid New Hampshire, Haley Turns Up the Heat. But Is It Too Late?","By Jazmine Ulloa, Anjali Huynh and Jonathan WeismanReporting from Haley campaign stops in multiple cities and towns in New Hampshire.","Published Jan. 21, 2024Updated Jan. 24, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/us/politics/haley-new-hampshire.html,"Nikki Haley on Saturday blasted Donald J. Trump’s dishonesty and his relationships with “dictators,” questioned his mental acuity and dismissed his mounting stack of endorsements, sharpening her attacks on him as she headed into the final two days of New Hampshire campaigning.
Delivering her most forceful case yet for the Republican presidential nomination, Ms. Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, embraced her underdog status this weekend as independent, anti-Trump voters urged her on.
But with the first-in-the-nation primary on Tuesday, Ms. Haley has enormous ground to make up and very little time to do it. Mr. Trump was filling arenas and event centers in Concord and Manchester, N.H., on Friday and Saturday, speaking to adoring throngs as Republican elected officials fell in line. His event Saturday night in Manchester drew a few thousand fans. Ms. Haley, meanwhile, was visiting retail stores and restaurants. Her largest event, in Nashua, N.H., drew around 500.
A Suffolk University/Boston Globe/NBC10 Boston daily tracking poll of New Hampshire voters on Saturday had Mr. Trump leading Ms. Haley by double digits, 53 percent to 36 percent, with his margin having crept up a percentage point each of the previous two days.
“When you’re dealing with the pressures of a presidency, we can’t have someone else that we question whether they’re mentally fit to do this — we can’t,” Ms. Haley said in Keene, N.H., criticizing Mr. Trump for confusing her with Nancy Pelosi at his Friday night rally. “So, that’s the choice. Do you want to win in November or not? Do you want to be scared in November or not? Do you want your kids to be proud in November or not?”
Later, in a news conference with reporters in Peterborough, N.H., Ms. Haley questioned whether Mr. Trump would be “on it” enough to lead the nation. “My parents are up in age, and I love them dearly,” she told reporters. “But when you see them hit a certain age, there is a decline. That’s a fact — ask any doctor, there is a decline.”
Still, as she barnstormed through New Hampshire on her 52nd birthday on Saturday, attack lines that had been at the end of her standard stump speech moved more toward the front. Even the sound of her voice grew more urgent. And she appeared to feed off the energy of her audiences.
“You can give me your gifts on Tuesday, at a polling place near you,” she told supporters in Rindge, N.H., after they sang “Happy Birthday” to her.
Ms. Haley and Mr. Trump are effectively in a two-person race for New Hampshire. The former president hopes to bury his competition on Tuesday, heading into the Nevada and U.S. Virgin Islands caucuses on Feb. 8 and then the South Carolina primary on Feb. 24. Ms. Haley is hoping for an upset win in New Hampshire to slingshot her back to her home state, where another strong showing could turn the expected Trump coronation into a protracted fight for the nomination.
Mr. Trump remains the favorite. Even amid the enthusiasm at Ms. Haley’s events in recent days, some of her ardent supporters confessed that they, too, had a sinking feeling about Tuesday.
“I have a feeling Trump may win again,” said Linda Merullo, a retiree and independent voter in Dover, N.H., who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016. “How very bizarre. Boy, are we messed up as a country.”
New Hampshire voters flocking to Ms. Haley’s events encouraged her to take on Mr. Trump and free the country from what they described as a dreadful choice in November — between the 77-year-old Mr. Trump and the 81-year-old President Biden.
“We need some young blood,” said Terry Cutter, a Republican from Hillsborough, N.H., who supported Mr. Trump in both 2016 and 2020 but plans to vote for Ms. Haley in the primary.
“Young blood, and a woman to get rid of some of this testosterone,” added his wife, Shelley Cutter, a Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton and Mr. Biden but is now backing Ms. Haley. “I don’t think anyone over 65 should be running for president. You don’t need a bunch of old, white men — we just need to get rid of them all.”
For months now, Ms. Haley has treated Mr. Trump gingerly, with gentle jabs mingled with respectful praise. A three-minute campaign video released this weekend features Cindy Warmbier, the mother of a college student who died at the hands of North Korea’s autocratic regime, praising Ms. Haley’s outreach as the ambassador to the United Nations. But not once does the ad mention that her son, Otto Warmbier, died while Mr. Trump was president, or that Mr. Trump went on to lavish effusive praise for, and shake the hand of, Kim Jong Un, the dictator responsible for Mr. Warmbier’s death.
New Hampshire, where around 40 percent of voters are independent, has long respected insurgent candidates willing to take on the favorite. In 2000, Senator John McCain of Arizona beat that year’s establishment titan, George W. Bush. Eight years later, Barack Obama swept into the state with a confidence buoyed by his victory in the Iowa caucuses, only to lose to Hillary Clinton in a contest that set off an epic fight for the Democratic nomination.
Ms. Haley, in these final days, seemed to be the last to realize a pugilistic streak is what independent-minded New Hampshire voters were craving.
Dave and Kathy Kelley of Hudson, N.H., said they had come to hear Ms. Haley speak in Nashua on Saturday evening, eager for her to adopt the tone that Chris Christie, the anti-Trump former governor of New Jersey, had toward Mr. Trump before he left the race.
“She needs to take him to task for other comments that he’s made about other people, threatening comments, and continuing the big lie for Jan. 6,” said Ms. Kelley, referring to the pro-Trump riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
Dave Kelley, 71, added, “It still feels like she’s hedging her bets.”
Laura Dowling, 60, a nurse from Nashua, revealed the same misgivings as she dug into a piece of the birthday cake presented to Ms. Haley at the Peddler’s Daughter, a lively Irish pub in Ms. Dowling’s hometown. “I don’t like nastiness in the primaries,” she said, “but I think she should be defending herself a little more.”
Ms. Haley’s stops have been big and small: a cramped, iconic store in Hooksett; a retro diner in Amherst; a tiny country store selling jars of maple syrup in Newfields; hotel ballrooms in Manchester and Nashua that brought in hundreds of well-wishers. Unlike Mr. Trump and his outsize rallies, Ms. Haley has been doing the retail work that New Hampshirites have come to expect — shaking hands, holding babies and answering personal questions one on one (though she has not held the town hall-style events that state voters also expect).
At a history and culture center in Keene, she bent down to tie an older supporter’s shoe and took pictures with another voter and her poodle mix. At the Peddler’s Daughter, Ms. Haley poured pints of Guinness from behind the bar and toasted with Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire as she was serenaded with “Happy Birthday” for a third time on Saturday. She took selfies with patrons, signed Haley posters and called a fan’s mother to wish her well.
She also made her final pitch to voters.
“The world is on fire,” she said to a couple of independent voters who told her they were scared of a Trump re-election and appreciated her message that “chaos” followed wherever he went. “We can’t have that again,” she said.
Ahead of Iowa, Ms. Haley had been looking to winnow the field. In New Hampshire, she told reporters on Friday, she was seeking to draw contrasts between herself and Mr. Trump. She has long treaded a careful line with the former president, on the stump and in her books. She rarely criticized him, even as he racked up criminal cases, faced accusations of sexual misconduct and warmed his rhetoric toward Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader.
In her final days on the trail, she has not entirely abandoned that approach, as she continued to call for generational change and describe Mr. Trump as a force of chaos. But on Saturday, she denounced his lies on her record and his ties to authoritarian leaders, accusing him of having a “bromance with Putin,” praising President Xi Jinping “a dozen times after China gave us Covid” and exchanging “love letters” with Mr. Kim.
“When you are talking about contrasts in foreign policy, you don’t praise dictators and thugs who want to kill us,” she said in Nashua, recounting Otto Warmbier’s story. “It’s not good for us.”
She said she had been “disappointed” that Senator Tim Scott, a fellow South Carolinian whom she appointed to the Senate in 2017, had endorsed Mr. Trump. She argued that she got “no love” from South Carolina lawmakers because she ran as an anti-establishment Tea Party conservative and pushed for reforms. Asked about Henry McMaster, her lieutenant governor who is now the governor of South Carolina and who campaigned on Saturday with Mr. Trump in New Hampshire, she shot back: “I’m sorry, is that the person I ran against for governor and beat? Just check it.”
Her more direct approach comes as her events have been packed wall to wall with supporters from near and far. A campaign staff member said the fire marshal showed up at one town hall in Keene, fretting over the overstuffed venue. At another event at a college in Rindge, many onlookers said they had come from Massachusetts, just to the south, or New York, to get a glimpse of the person they said they hoped would be the first female president.
Such voters expressed a desperate desire for someone to beat Mr. Trump. Ms. Haley is a candidate, they said, whom they can vote for, not against.
Thalia Floras, of Nashua, switched her “lifetime” party affiliation as a Democrat so that she could vote for Ms. Haley in the primary. But she worried that her candidate's new tone was too timid and too late.
“I wish she had started doing that a little while back,” Ms. Floras, 61, said. “She does it with a little bit of humor, and she does it with grace.”"
KQNU0M2722_WYT0WKM2B51PT4M,"Brent Sikkema, Influential New York Gallerist, Dies at 75",By Will Heinrich,"Jan. 21, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/arts/brent-sikkema-dead.html,"Brent Sikkema, an influential and well respected New York City gallerist, was found dead on Jan. 15 in an apartment he owned in Rio de Janeiro. He was 75.
The Brazilian police said that he had apparently been stabbed multiple times, and that an investigation was ongoing. A suspect was arrested on Thursday.
As the founder of what became the Sikkema Jenkins & Co. gallery in Manhattan’s Chelsea arts district, Mr. Sikkema discovered, guided, exhibited and sold a diverse and notably international rotation of distinguished artists whose work married bright, accessible colors to substantive subjects like memory, race and identity.
Sikkema Jenkins represented artists at every stage of their careers — from Sheila Hicks, a long-established pioneer of textile art, to Louis Fratino, a young figurative painter — and in every medium, from the politically inflected sculptor William Cordova to the estate of the choreographer Trisha Brown. Some artists inevitably moved on to larger galleries. But a tight core of loyalists, most notably Vik Muniz, Arturo Herrera and Kara Walker, remained with Mr. Sikkema for decades as they built their careers together.
“Brent Sikkema and I had a personal connection that went well beyond that of gallery director and exhibiting artist,” Ms. Walker said in a statement. “He was a nurturing, protective figure to me when I was a quite young upstart. He saw in me something beyond what either of us could fully articulate, but I think we brought out the best in each other.”
Writing about Mr. Sikkema on Instagram, Mr. Muniz, a photographer who was born in São Paulo and now has homes in New York and Rio, said, “I have spent more than 30 years trying to pointlessly emulate his juggling of fearlessness, kindness and sophistication.”
In recent years Mr. Sikkema had been somewhat less engaged with the gallery’s day-to-day operations as he spent more time in Brazil, where he was seeking residency and where several of his artists lived. But the institution, which he had built around his own taste and judgment, continued to touch artists like the painter Brenda Goodman, who began showing with Sikkema Jenkins in 2019 — but who had aspired to do so for many years before that.
“I first moved to New York in 1976,” she said in an interview, and since the moment Sikkema Jenkins opened, “that was my dream gallery.”
Brent Fay Sikkema was born on Aug. 13, 1948, in Morrison, Ill., the younger of two children of Dwaine Louis Sikkema and Emily (Howe) Sikkema. For a time his parents owned and operated a tavern in Morrison.
Mr. Sikkema and his husband, Daniel (Garcia) Sikkema, were in the midst of a divorce. He is also survived by their son, Lucas Sikkema.
Mr. Sikkema earned a B.F.A. degree in 1970 and an M.F.A. in 1971 from the San Francisco Art Institute, where he studied filmmaking and photography. He won grants as a photographer from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1975 and 1979. As late as 1990, when he had a solo show at the Thomas Segal Gallery in Boston, he was still making photographs of his own, using multiple exposures to create black-and-white prints full of art-historical references.
But he also began working with other people’s art right out of school, as director of traveling exhibitions and then director of exhibitions at the nonprofit Visual Studies Workshop in Rochester, N.Y. In 1976 he moved to the Vision Gallery in Boston, which handled 19th- and 20th-century photography and listed many museums among its clients. By 1980, he had become the gallery’s owner.
(He was also briefly married to Mary Pratt, Vision’s founder; that early marriage was the second of two that ended in divorce.)
In 1989, he staged his first show in New York under the name Brent Sikkema Fine Art. Two years later he opened a permanent space in SoHo that he called Wooster Gardens. There he showed innovative photography and a number of women painters — among them Mary Heilmann, Ann Craven and Amy Sillman. In 1995, he gave Kara Walker’s provocative black paper silhouettes their first solo show.
Michael Jenkins began working with Mr. Sikkema in 1991, officially becoming a gallery director in 1996 and a partner in 2003. Meg Malloy became a partner in 2005.
Artists formerly represented by the gallery include Ms. Sillman, Mark Bradford, Wangechi Mutu, Deana Lawson and Arlene Shechet.
In 1999, Mr. Sikkema was in the early wave of gallerists moving from SoHo to far west Chelsea, which at the time was still a semi-deserted industrial neighborhood. There he showed glass sculptures by Josiah McElheny, photographs by Tim Davis and the mystical drawings of the Ivoirian outsider artist Frédéric Bruly Bouabré and, as Ken Johnson wrote in a 2000 New York Times review of a group show that included Barkley L. Hendricks and Wangechi Mutu, expanded his affinity for multiculturalism “not as a bureaucratic program but as a kind of delirious pluralism.”
Jeffrey Gibson, who this year will become the first Indigenous artist to represent the United States at the Venice Biennale, joined the gallery in 2018. He also shared a statement dwelling on Mr. Sikkema’s generosity.
“Brent was an early supporter of many queer art spaces including Participant Inc., FIAR and Boffo, among others,” he wrote. “He would always take the time to engage with artists, not like a dealer or gallerist, but more like a supportive friend.”"
LGP88PJ77N_KAQWAB4E7JTX08P,"As U.S. and Militias Engage, White House Worries About a Tipping Point",By Peter BakerReporting from Washington,"Jan. 22, 2024, 3:15 p.m. ET",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/us/politics/us-militias-tipping-point.html,"Another day, another barrage of rockets and another spark that American officials fear could set off a wildfire of violence across the Middle East.
The latest attack on American troops in the region over the weekend resulted in no deaths, but President Biden and his advisers worry that it is only a matter of time. Whenever a report of a strike arrives at the White House Situation Room, officials wonder whether this will be the one that forces a more decisive retaliation and results in a broader regional war.
The assault on American troops based at Al Asad Air Base in western Iraq on Saturday night was by one measure the most successful believed to be carried out by a militia sponsored by Iran since the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Two out of an estimated 17 rockets and short-range ballistic missiles fired at the base made it through air defense systems. An unspecified number of American military personnel were reported injured, but none were said to have been killed.
But it was just the latest in a regular string of relatively low-level assaults that have become a way of life in the Middle East for U.S. forces since the Hamas attack. As of Thursday, Iranian-backed militias had already carried out 140 attacks on American troops in Iraq and Syria, with nearly 70 U.S. personnel wounded, some of them suffering traumatic brain injuries. All but a few have been able to return to duty in short order, according to the Pentagon.

MXRA4MFMPE_58QKU8GTHQDH76R,First Black Women to Cover the White House Are Honored in the Briefing Room,By Erica L. GreenReporting from the White House briefing room,"Jan. 21, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/us/politics/black-women-white-house-dunnigan-payne.html,"On her first day covering the White House, Alice Dunnigan had every reason to stand out.
She was the first Black woman to be credentialed to join the White House press corps, and she had even arrived an hour early to cover her first news conference with President Harry S. Truman. But as she sat in the lobby of the West Wing, she may as well have been invisible.
“I sat there alone and apparently unnoticed, taking in all the activity while glancing now and then at my newspaper,” she wrote in her autobiography, “Alone Atop the Hill.” “If anyone wondered who I was or why I was there, they made no effort to find out.”
More than 75 years later, Ms. Dunnigan’s memory is being honored in the same setting where her colleagues once ignored her.
Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, in November named a new lectern in the White House briefing room for Ms. Dunnigan of The Associated Negro Press and Ethel L. Payne, who joined her on the beat a few years later for The Chicago Defender.

O6DY8OEB2D_RBINCIM50SC6687,Haley Picks Up Endorsement of New Hampshire’s Largest Newspaper,By Neil Vigdor,"Jan. 21, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/us/politics/union-leader-endorses-haley.html,"The Union Leader, New Hampshire’s largest newspaper and one that reliably picked Republicans for a century before the rise of Donald Trump, endorsed Nikki Haley on Sunday in the Republican primary.
“Of course, we can’t talk about Nikki Haley without addressing the elephant in the room and the rather old donkey hiding in the White House,” it wrote, alluding to Mr. Trump and President Biden — though making no mention of Mr. Trump by name.
The newspaper did not endorse Mr. Trump in the previous two cycles, either.
In the 2016 Republican contest, it backed then-Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey — but later retracted its endorsement when Mr. Christie, who dropped out of the race after a poor showing in New Hampshire, endorsed Mr. Trump.
Then in the 2016 general election, for the first time in more than 100 years, it did not endorse a Republican, instead choosing Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee.
And in 2020, it endorsed Joseph R. Biden Jr. instead of Mr. Trump, who had previously called the newspaper’s publisher a “lowlife” in a television interview.
“Nikki Haley is an opportunity to vote for a candidate rather than against those two,” the endorsement reads, again referring to Mr. Trump. It called Ms. Haley a “candidate who can run circles around the dinosaurs from the last two administrations, backwards and in heels.”"
PY6LAQPJ6M_XWXNFGESIEWO7A4,"Deadly Blast Hits Market in Ukrainian City Controlled by Russia, Officials Say",By Matthew Mpoke Bigg,"Published Jan. 21, 2024Updated Jan. 23, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/world/europe/ukraine-donetsk-market-blast.html,"At least 25 people were killed on Sunday when artillery shells hit a market in Donetsk, a city in eastern Ukraine occupied by Russian forces, the pro-Moscow head of the region said, blaming Ukrainian forces for the strike.
If confirmed, the episode would be one of the most serious in recent months involving civilians in an area controlled by Moscow. Ukraine’s military released a statement on Facebook late on Sunday that referred to the market blast, but said it was not responsible. “Donetsk is Ukraine,” the statement by the Tavria military grouping said.
Denis Pushilin, the pro-Moscow leader in the Russia-held part of the region, said on the Telegram messaging app that 20 people had also been wounded at the market, which is in the Kirovsky district and southwest of the city center. The area is roughly eight miles east of the front line in the war.
The pro-Russian mayor of Donetsk, Aleksei Kulemzin, said on Telegram that the market “was attacked on Sunday, when it is busiest,” calling it “horrendous.”
Reuters and The Associated Press carried footage they said they had verified of the immediate aftermath of the episode. It showed bodies in civilian clothes scattered in the snow in an urban street and wounded people being helped by passers-by.
Russia annexed Donetsk and Luhansk as well as two other regions of Ukraine in fall 2022, around seven months after the start of its full-scale invasion. Ukraine and most international governments condemned the annexations as illegal, but according to Moscow, Donetsk is now part of Russia’s sovereign territory and the region’s citizens are Russian.
As a result, Moscow presents any strikes on civilians as an attack across a national boundary that it says undermines Ukraine’s claim to them.
In contrast, the Ukrainian authorities say they confine their attacks to military targets in what they describe as the temporarily occupied territories to avoid hitting their own citizens.
The authorities in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions staged referendums in 2022 and said that the results showed that a large majority of residents wanted to join Russia. But the votes were widely denounced as a sham, and it is unclear what percentage of the population supports Moscow. At the same time, human rights groups accuse the pro-Moscow authorities of detaining and torturing people they suspect of opposing Russian rule.
Around 10,000 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Russia began its full-scale invasion around two years ago and around 18,000 have been wounded, according to United Nations data. A vast majority of the casualties have come in shelling and other strikes. In one incident in October in a village in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, 52 people were killed when a missile hit a cafe where a wake was being held. Ukraine considers these attacks to be war crimes.
Sunday’s market blast comes at an uncertain time in the Donetsk region. Russia, which has effectively controlled Donetsk city since 2014, fought off a counteroffensive in the region last year that had targeted the city of Bakhmut and that aimed to retake other territory in the south and east of the country.
In the fall, Russia scaled up its own offensive around the cities of Marinka and Avdiivka, which are close to Donetsk’s western suburbs.
The Ukrainian military said in recent weeks that it had all but withdrawn its forces from Marinka, a city that, like Avdiivka, is in ruins after months of shelling.
While this gave a victory to the Kremlin, progress toward its overall goal in eastern Ukraine of seizing control of the whole of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which are together known as the Donbas, has been slow. Military analysts say that despite heavy fighting and substantial casualties on both sides, a Russian breakthrough in the short term looks unlikely.

UQ39M32WIB_FSNL2S3UYMMXBP2,Overturning ‘Chevron’ Can Help Rebalance the Constitutional Order,_,"Jan. 21, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/opinion/supreme-court-chevron.html,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday heard oral arguments in a case that could go a long way toward fixing some of the systemic dysfunction in American government. The case, which revisits a judicial doctrine known as the “Chevron deference,” has been widely described as a conservative effort to limit government. But that’s not entirely correct. The case is better understood as a key part of the effort to restore the proper balance of power among the three branches of government.
If you took high school civics, there is a good chance you’ve heard the phrase “coequal branches of government.” It’s such a common formulation for America’s separation of powers that it’s easy to slide into the false belief that each branch of government is equal in authority to the others.
But if you read the Constitution, you’ll quickly see that while each branch of government has some power to check the others, one branch is plainly supreme. The government can’t spend one dime unless it’s appropriated through Congress. Impeachment gives Congress the power to fire not only the president but also any member of the Supreme Court. Only Congress has the power to declare war.
Even if the president takes the exceptional step of vetoing a bill it has passed, Congress has the power to override that veto. And the Constitution gives Congress immense power over the federal judiciary. Congress defines the number of judges and justices, sets their compensation and defines the full extent of their jurisdiction.
Not only is Congress the most powerful of the three branches of government, it’s also the branch closest to the people. Members of the House and Senate are elected by popular vote, and members of the House run for election every two years. By contrast, no American ever votes for a single federal judge — let alone a Supreme Court justice — and the Electoral College distances the presidency from majority rule to such an extent that the last two Republican presidents entered office having failed to win the popular vote.
And indeed there is a compelling logic in the most powerful branch also being the branch closest to the people. It builds popular support for public policy, and it provides Americans with the crucial sense that they are participants in American democracy, not mere observers of the machinations of a distant government elite.
But by now you most likely see the problem. Congress is not performing its constitutional tasks. It’s a broken institution that contains too few genuine lawmakers and far too many would-be activists and TV pundits. Time and again, it has proved incapable of compromise or of accomplishing even the most basic legislative tasks. It’s been 27 years since it even passed a budget on time. And that barely begins to capture the current level of dysfunction, with a razor-thin House Republican majority consistently held hostage by a mere handful of MAGA extremists.
As Congress has shirked its duties, presidents and the courts have filled the power vacuum. Presidents have used the power of their executive agencies to promulgate new regulations without congressional involvement. Executive agencies publish 3,000 to 4,500 new rules per year, and these regulations have a substantial impact on the American economy. Compounding the problem, courts have ratified that presidential power grab by enacting a series of judge-made rules that require federal courts to defer to the decisions of executive agencies.
The most important of those judge-made rules is called “Chevron deference,” named after the 1984 Supreme Court case Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council. The case involved a highly technical dispute over the meaning of the term “stationary source” under amendments to the Clean Air Act. Congress did not define the term, so the E.P.A. defined it for itself. The question at issue was whether the court should defer to the agency’s interpretation or interpret the statute itself.
The court chose to defer to the E.P.A., and it established a default rule of deference going forward. If the statute an agency administers is “silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,” the majority held, “the question for the court is whether the agency’s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.”
The justification for Chevron deference is compelling, at least on the surface. Agencies regulate some of the most complex businesses and industries in the United States. They possess a level of expertise that’s clearly beyond the capabilities of Congress. Why not defer to their determinations? Isn’t that simply wise?
But what might be wise in specific, highly technical circumstances can be very problematic when adopted as a general rule, as the Chevron doctrine has been. Chevron disrupted the constitutional order by effectively giving the president the power to make, interpret and enforce laws acting solely through his administrative agencies. It injected the presidency’s lawmaking abilities with steroids.
This is not the way the United States was intended to function. It magnifies the power of the president beyond recognition, diminishes democracy, raises the stakes of presidential elections to destabilizing levels and puts immense pressure on the president to maximize his rule-making authority. Just as bad, it encourages congressional inaction and incompetence. If the agencies can take over when Congress is silent or ambiguous, it diminishes the necessity for Congress to speak clearly. It’s much easier to punt the hard decisions to the president, and then heckle (or cheer) from Fox News or MSNBC.
How have we seen this dynamic play out? Three consecutive administrations — Obama, Trump and Biden — have attempted radically different immigration reforms through executive action rather than through legislation. We’ve also seen the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations enact or propose divergent rules and regulations on sex discrimination under Title IX. We’ve witnessed President Biden attempt to forgive student loans and mandate workplace vaccinations through executive action.
These policy disputes and policy shifts have very little to do with “agency expertise” and everything to do with presidential ideology. The language of Title IX or of federal immigration statutes isn’t changing, but the ideological commitments of the president do, and the president is then using his rule-making authority to alter the law. The same law shouldn’t mean wildly different things based on the whim of a president.
Wednesday’s oral argument signaled that America may be on the verge of a welcome restoration of proper constitutional order. The case is called Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, and the facts are both simple and representative of how the Chevron doctrine distorts American law. The plaintiffs are fishing companies that are challenging a federal rule that requires them to pay the cost for federal observers who board their boats and observe their compliance with federal fishing rules.
The plaintiffs aren’t challenging just the rule itself; they’re also challenging Chevron deference, arguing that it is “at odds with the basic division of labor in the first three Articles of the Constitution.” Unfortunately, much of the commentary around the case has been simplistic and reductive, casting the case as merely another Republican effort to limit government power.
But it’s not that simple. After all, some conservative jurists, including most notably Antonin Scalia, agreed with Chevron. In 1989, Scalia wrote that “broad delegation to the executive is the hallmark of the modern administrative state.” He said the nation was “awash in agency ‘expertise.’”
Yet the question at issue in Loper Bright — like the questions at issue in many of the administrative law cases that fall under Chevron — has nothing to do with special agency expertise. Congress is perfectly qualified to determine who should bear the cost of fishery observers.
The question isn’t how much power the government should possess, but rather who should possess it. And it’s far from clear to me that it’s inherently “conservative” or “Republican” to say that Congress, the most democratic branch of government, should possess more power than the president. Indeed, a number of conservatives adhere to a theory of presidential power called the “unitary executive” that often means the opposite, increasing executive authority at the expense of Congress.
Moreover, reversing Chevron wouldn’t end executive rule-making. Nor would it block Congress from explicitly granting agencies a degree of discretion based on agency expertise. It would instead roll back the president’s extraordinary dominance. Do we really want to maintain a system that enables a man like Donald Trump to eclipse both Congress and the judiciary?
Americans feel alienated from their government for good reason. Democracy feels more distant because it is more distant. Decades of congressional failure have diminished congressional power and placed it in the hands of presidents and their army of unelected administrators. We need to reverse bad precedent. Regardless of whether one is for big government or small government, we should all be for democratic government, and that — at the very least — requires Congress to do its job.

V7TJ2HXNCC_GBZWXGJ6NMLC26C,"In France, a Conviction for Police Brutality, but Little Expectation of Change","By Aurelien BreedenReporting from Aulnay-sous-Bois, France","Jan. 21, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/world/europe/france-police-brutality-verdict.html,"When a French police officer was found guilty on Friday of assaulting Théo Luhaka, a 22-year-old Black man, during a 2017 identity check that led to his arrest, lawyers on both sides left the courthouse claiming victory in one of France’s most publicized cases of police abuse.
Mr. Luhaka, now 29, was officially recognized as a victim of police brutality after a seven-year legal ordeal. But the officer received only a one-year suspended sentence and was cleared of a more serious charge that he had permanently mutilated Mr. Luhaka. Neither side seemed intent on appealing.
On Saturday in Aulnay-sous-Bois, the northeastern suburb of Paris where Mr. Luhaka was assaulted and where he still lives, residents said they felt more disillusioned than encouraged. To them, progress in punishing police misconduct felt like the biting winter air: glacial.
“There is a two-tier justice system,” said Mohamed Djezzar, 29, a computer engineering student. Even though the officer and two of his colleagues were convicted, the sentences were too light, Mr. Djezzar added. Friends often complain of repeated, unwarranted identity checks, he said, and this case will do little to unseat deeply rooted animosity toward the police.
“I was under no illusions,” Mr. Djezzar said, his breath forming misty clouds of condensation in the frigid air. “It’s always the same thing.”
Mr. Djezzar was exercising in a hilly, snow-covered park not far from the low-slung concrete apartment blocks that Mr. Luhaka was cutting through in 2017 when three officers subdued him during an identity check. One of them thrust a baton at Mr. Luhaka’s upper thigh and caused a four-inch tear to his rectum.
The incident triggered several days of rioting, pushed François Hollande, then France’s president, who was Socialist, to visit Mr. Luhaka in the hospital, and led Emmanuel Macron, then a presidential candidate, to promise he would create a police force better attuned to local communities.
Seven years later, change feels elusive — especially recalling the week of chaotic and violent protests that rocked France last summer after the police fatally shot Nahel Merzouk, a 17-year-old French citizen of North African descent, during a traffic stop.
A preliminary government report later found that much of that week’s looting, arson and vandalism was opportunistic. But simmering anger about heavy-handed police tactics in France’s poorer urban suburbs, which are often home to people with immigrant backgrounds, provided the initial spark.
Sébastian Roché, a policing expert at France’s National Center for Scientific Research, said that Mr. Luhaka’s case was “emblematic” of “persistent” problems in those suburbs, like identity checks that are a cover for racial profiling, or the disproportionate use of nonlethal but potentially dangerous weapons like tear gas grenades and rubber bullets.
SOS Racisme, one of France’s main anti-discrimination groups, said in a statement on Friday that Mr. Luhaka’s case should push the French authorities “to finally open a debate and initiate reforms to ensure this never happens again.”
But Mr. Macron, now president, and Gérald Darmanin, his tough-talking interior minister, have shown little appetite for those kinds of changes. French officials have dismissed accusations of systemic problems with racism and violence among the police.
At a recent news conference, Mr. Macron vowed that the police would clear out notorious drug trafficking spots every week and that the number of police officers in the streets would be doubled. But he was less specific on ways to reduce discrimination, focusing instead on measures like school uniforms and mandatory community service for teenagers that he said would foster national unity.
Police unions have also fought back against attempts to curb some aggressive policing methods, arguing that officers face increasingly dangerous working conditions in areas rife with drug trafficking.
In 2020, after furious union protests, the government softened key provisions of a proposal to ban chokeholds during arrests after the death of Cédric Chouviat, a deliveryman who was pinned to the ground and put in such a hold.
Linda Kebbab, a spokeswoman for Unité SGP Police, one of France’s largest police unions, told reporters at the courthouse on Friday that the three officers convicted of assaulting Mr. Luhaka could not be faulted for doing a “difficult” job in a “very complicated” drug-dealing spot. As she spoke, anti-police violence activists tried to drown her out with chants.
“Some want the head of police officers as trophies,” Ms. Kebbab shot back.
Bruno Pomart, the head of an association that organizes police outreach workshops, said that the French authorities had long been suspicious of softer approaches to local policing. Mr. Macron once derided the notion that it was an officer’s job to “play soccer with young people.”
“Over 36 years in the force, I had a lot of trouble getting people to subscribe to this approach,” said Mr. Pomart, a retired police officer who created the association, Raid Aventure, in 1992. “It wasn’t in the police’s DNA.”
Attitudes have changed slightly, he said. Every year, his group organizes over 100 workshops, with sports activities, first-aid classes or explanations of policing methods, that are led by volunteer officers in cities around France.
But many high-profile legal cases involving police misconduct have yet to reach a trial — or never will — after years of tortuous investigations, further fueling a sense that the system is stacked against victims of police brutality.
An investigation into the case of Adama Traoré, who died in 2016 after three officers pinned him to the ground during an arrest, was closed in September without any charges filed. In the case of Zineb Redouane, an 80-year-old woman who died in 2018 after being hit by a tear gas grenade as she was closing her windows during a Yellow Vest protest in Marseille, no one has been charged.
Officers have been charged in the case of Michel Zecler, a Black music producer who in 2020 was beaten by the police in the vestibule of the building where he keeps his music studio — but no trial date has been set.
“Each time there is a case like this, we go backward,” said Réda Didi, a community organizer at the head of Graines de France, an association that tries to improve relations with institutions like the police with writing or theater workshops and conversations with famous athletes.
Last summer, one of the group’s programs at a middle school in Nanterre, the suburb where Mr. Merzouk was killed, had to be paused for a month because tensions were running too high, he said.
While the pace of institutional change is slow, experts see signs that public opinion is moving slightly faster, especially with the ubiquity of video. Mr. Merzouk’s shooting and Mr. Luhaka’s arrest were both captured on camera.
Mr. Roché, the policing expert, said the growing number of cases over the past few years — coupled with the rise of small but active advocacy groups, often centered around victims’ families — had shifted what kind of police methods society deems acceptable.
“Public opinion moves first, then the courts,” Mr. Roché said, noting that while convictions of officers accused of misconduct are still uncommon, more cases are going to trial.
In September, five officers based in Pantin, a northern suburb of Paris, were found guilty of violent assault and of writing false police reports. This month, in Nice, a police captain stood trial for ordering a riot-police charge against Yellow Vest protesters in 2019 that left a protester with a fractured skull.
“There is a tension in every democracy” between civil rights and the rules that govern police use of intrusive or violent tools, Mr. Roché said. “What’s at stake is how you adjust the cursor between the two,” he added. “And that’s what these cases highlight.”
In Aulnay-sous-Bois, many felt the cursor still needed adjusting.
Yamina Abdel, 50, said that the officer convicted of injuring Mr. Luhaka “should have done at least a bit of prison time.” Bundled up in a beige winter coat and a giant scarf, she kept her arms moving to stay warm in the bitter cold.
“Wasn’t that case seven years ago?” she added. “Feels like it was yesterday.”"
W4Y5WL1I41_0L0UKK1GEG1W2LO,"Deep Under Gaza, Evidence of Cells and Hostages, Israel Says","By Isabel KershnerIsabel Kershner traveled with Israeli troops into Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, and spent two hours underground in a Hamas tunnel compound.","Jan. 21, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/world/middleeast/gaza-hamas-israel-tunnels-hostages.html,"In a subterranean compound deep below Khan Younis, a Hamas stronghold in the southern Gaza Strip, the five cells with barred doors that the Israeli military says held hostages abducted from Israel had clearly been constructed long in advance.
The tunnel builders even paid some attention to décor: The tiled walls of a small kitchenette in the compound, littered with remnants of food and dirty dishes, were embellished with a quaint, if incongruous, motif of teapots and teacups.
The Israeli military said that roughly 20 hostages were kept in the compound at various times. It said it pieced that assessment together based on testimony it said it gathered from the captives, as well as evidence like DNA. Some were released among the more than 100 hostages freed during a weeklong truce in late November, while others, including older people, were later dispersed to other locations in Gaza, the military said.
There has been no independent confirmation of the Israeli account of the compound, but details provided to Israeli media by one of the hostages — who was freed in November and, Israel says, held in the Khan Younis compound — aligns with some of those assertions.
Some 240 captives were seized during the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli officials. More than 25,000 Gazans have been killed so far, most of them civilians, according to health authorities in the enclave, following a punishing counterattack by Israel.
A journalist for The New York Times descended on Friday morning into the dark labyrinth leading to the compound under Khan Younis, escorted by Israeli soldiers and military officials to show what they said were the conditions in which the hostages had been held.
An arched chamber at the mouth of the corridor leading to the cells with barred doors was covered with green carpeting, like fake grass, and strewed with detritus.
Amid a jumble of blankets with floral patterns and plastic bottles lay several empty tubes labeled RPG-7VR, a kind of rocket-propelled grenade, and bearing the insignia of Hamas’s military wing, the Qassam Brigades. In a dim corner, there were four standing fans, a half-used pack of disposable diapers and a metal Palestine Red Crescent Society first-aid case containing a packet of latex gloves and a few sealed gauze pads.
The guided visit to the compound came as Israel, after more than 100 days of fighting in Gaza, appeared increasingly torn between the dueling war goals of dismantling Hamas’s military and its governing abilities and of freeing the remaining 130 or so captives, which will most likely require a diplomatic deal involving a cease-fire.
At least 25 of the captives have already been declared dead, and many Israelis fear that time is running out for the rest. The military offensive has slowed, complicated by the sheer scope and sophistication of Hamas’s vast tunnel network that crisscrosses the Palestinian enclave, extending for hundreds of miles, according to Israeli intelligence.
Beneath Khan Younis alone, the military estimates that Hamas dug at least 100 miles of tunnels across several levels, creating an inverted, multistory complex.
“We are fighting in Khan Younis above ground and below ground,” said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military, who led the tour of the subterranean compound on Friday. He added, “This kind of warfare is unlike any other modern battlefield anywhere in the world.”
The spiraling death toll in Gaza has increased international pressure on Israel to end the war. Above ground, much of Gaza is in ruins.
“Israel does not seek destruction,” Admiral Hagari said. “This war is a tragedy.” But there is no way to destroy tunnels built beneath civilian areas without damaging the structures above, he said, adding, “Hamas knows that.”
The Times and other journalists accepted a military escort to visit the underground compound and secure rare access to wartime Gaza, which is mainly off-limits to the outside news media.
After a half-hour journey in an armored vehicle, the journalists were taken to a ground-level entrance with an open metal door in the side of a three-story apartment building that led down a staircase to a maze of tunnels that branched out in different directions. The neighborhood, in eastern Khan Younis, had been evacuated.
The tunnel entrance, located under the residence of a Hamas operative, was booby-trapped with explosives, according to the Israeli military. As soldiers of the 98th Paratroopers Division advanced along the underground route, they encountered blast doors and engaged in close combat with several fighters, who were killed, the military said. By the time the soldiers reached the carpeted chamber and cells, the hostages had been moved to another location, the military said, without saying when it believed hostages had last been present there.
The compound was about a half-mile into the warren of tunnels, which was lined with electricity and communications cables, and about 65 feet — or about six floors — underground. To reach it required walking single file through pitch darkness and walking down long flights of stairs carved into the earth. The air was thick and humid.
In the abandoned chamber, which was equipped with basic light fittings, the Israeli military said soldiers had found two drawings by a child. The military showed photographs of the drawings — both of a house against a backdrop of hills with a sun and clouds in the sky — that it said were drawn by Emilia Aloni, 5, an Israeli girl who was abducted with her mother, Danielle Aloni, 44, on Oct. 7 from Kibbutz Nir Oz. After nearly seven weeks in captivity, the Alonis were released in a first group of 13 hostages, all women and children, under the temporary truce deal in November.
In interviews with Israeli television channels after the hostages’ release, Ms. Aloni displayed pictures she said were drawn by her daughter in captivity that closely resembled those the Israeli military said had been found in the compound under Khan Younis.
In the television interviews, Ms. Aloni said she and her daughter were taken into a tunnel soon after arriving in Gaza and then walked for hours in what she described as an “underground city.” Eventually, she said, they came to a kind of “cave” where there were about a dozen other captives, including wounded older people and a teenager.
Ms. Aloni recalled sleeping on mattresses next to other hostages in extremely humid conditions with little air, making it hard to breathe.
The Alonis were held underground for several days and then moved to an apartment above ground where they stayed for nearly two weeks with other hostages, Ms. Aloni said. They were then returned to the tunnels for safety, she said, as Israeli fighter jets pounded Gaza.
Ms. Aloni appeared in a hostage video in late October with two other women, Rimon Kirsht, 36, and Yelena Trupanob, 50, who were also released a month later.
In a document released on Sunday by Hamas in which it provided its own narrative of recent events, the group said that it “dealt in a positive and kind manner with all the civilians who have been held in Gaza.”
Many of the released hostages say they received little food and water, inadequate medical treatment, if any, and were kept in tough conditions.
The Israeli military said some of the hostages were kept in the central chamber and others in the narrow cells with the barred doors. The cells had clinical white-tiled walls broken by a vertical purple stripe with a toilet and sink in the back of each one; some also had a small shower nozzle. Soldiers escorting the journalists said that strands of hair had been found in the cells, as well as a bra. The military said DNA testing matched the hair with hostages, but did not say who.
Ayala Metzger, the daughter-in-law of Yoram Metzger, 80, who is still a captive in Gaza, told Israel’s Channel 12 News on Sunday that his DNA was found on clothes left behind in the compound.
A boiler provided hot water when there was electricity.
Any hostages kept in the compound would have had little sense of time below ground, or of the destruction taking place on the surface.
Emerging back into sunlight two hours after entering the tunnel, the subterranean silence was replaced for the reporters accompanying the Israeli military on Friday by the sounds of war. A drone whined in the sky. Sharp cracks and booms stirred up plumes of dark smoke.
The neighborhood is a wasteland, surrounded by mounds of earth and rubble and churned up roads.
Inside the house that Israel says belonged to the Hamas operative, a marble staircase hinted at a level of opulence. Copper and gold curtains still hung at blown-out windows in a lower-floor bedroom, and most of an outside wall had gone. Not one building in the vicinity looked habitable.
By Saturday, the tunnels and the compound below the neighborhood had been blown up.

WO2F596XUJ_DHW16BJ7SMFGIRL,This Is Why Americans Are So Cynical About Politics,_,"Jan. 21, 2024",20240114,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/opinion/america-politics-cynical-dysfunctional.html,"Last week, a group of federal employees organized a protest of the Biden administration’s support of Israel in its war with Hamas. Although a snowstorm in Washington complicated their plans, some federal employees from a range of agencies declined to work for a day. Meanwhile at the Capitol, Republican members of the House of Representatives were once again threatening to throw their institution into chaos to prevent their leader from negotiating a spending package with Democrats.
These seemingly unconnected dramas, on opposite sides of the partisan divide, offered examples of a characteristic disorder of this moment in our politics — the confusion of roles that leaves insiders behaving like outsiders and makes effective public action awfully difficult.
Federal employees have every right to participate in protests in their personal capacities. And they have every right to resign their positions to express strong disagreement with the policies of the administration they serve — as a number of Biden administration officials have done over the Israel-Hamas war. This latest group of federal workers, however, organized a protest in their capacities as government officials yet did so anonymously to avoid being held responsible.
They were not the first. Late last year, about a hundred Democratic congressional staff members — many wearing masks to hide their identities — staged a walkout to, as some put it, “demand” that their bosses’ “speak up” for a “cease-fire, a release of all hostages and an immediate de-escalation now.” Hundreds of Biden administration officials sent a letter to the president in November opposing his Israel policy without signing their names to it, out of what they called “concern for our personal safety and risk of potentially losing our jobs.” There was even a vigil in which White House staff members protested outside the White House wearing masks and sunglasses.
They didn’t resign, and (inexplicably) they weren’t fired. They just used their positions as federal officials to raise the visibility of their protests against federal policy. And they didn’t seem to see a contradiction between the two. On the contrary, as reported by the news site Al-Monitor, which broke the news of plans for the most recent walkout, the organizers believed they were acting out of an obligation “to influence change from inside.”
But were they acting as insiders or outsiders? Were they engaged in making public policy or expressing private views? They were intentionally muddling that boundary. Their actions violated the basic norms of federal employment and (to the extent they constitute a labor action) perhaps even the law. But they evince a confusion that is now all too common.
In fact, a version of the same confusion of roles is at play in the persistent dysfunction of Congress, where too many members treat the institution like a platform for expressing dissent rather than a space for legislative negotiation. Anyone who has attended a high-profile congressional hearing in recent years can attest that hearings have become production sessions for YouTube clips and other social media posts rather than opportunities for collective deliberation or debate. The travails of House Republicans in this Congress have had much to do with the tendency of members to treat the House as a platform for commentary or performance art.
These performances often use Congress not only as a stage but also as a foil, treating the bargaining and deal making that is the essence of legislative work as a form of corruption. Members who view their roles this way are less interested in winning substantive policy concessions than in positioning themselves as outside observers narrating a morality play in which their own ineffectiveness stands as proof of their purity.
Some younger members can be quite open about this. When Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, was asked by a reporter a few years ago if he was concerned that he was gaining notoriety outside Congress rather than influence in it, he answered: “What’s the difference? People have to know who you are and what you’re doing if your opinions are to matter.”
Neither Republican nor Democratic insiders who pitch themselves as outsiders seem to see how this damages their ability to solve problems that concern them.
The outsider yelling at the system can speak some truth to power, but at the cost of having no power. Such people play an essential role, especially in the face of dangerously disconnected elites. The insider acting in the system can exercise real authority, but at the cost of being restrained by institutional responsibility and public accountability. That person is crucial, too, because someone has to enter the arena and facilitate effective and legitimate public action.
The twisted hybrids that we now live with present themselves as simultaneously truth tellers and power players but, in fact, are just exercising power without responsibility. By seeking the government job and the activist megaphone at the same time, they render public officials into passive observers and critics, or else they deploy power outside its legitimate channels.
The difference between the insider and the outsider is crucial in the politics of a free society. The loss of public trust in core American institutions in our time has had everything to do with the sense that the elites who run those institutions are unrestrained by formal responsibility and use their positions merely as platforms for their own priorities.
There is no easy fix for these problems. The Biden administration should be willing to fire employees who can’t handle the constraints of government work. Voters need to punish politicians who aren’t interested in doing their jobs. The incentives officials confront need to stop encouraging their worst habits.
But before such habits can change, they have to be seen as a problem. Constituents, voters and public officials themselves need to grasp that blurring the lines between insider work and outsider expression renders government less trustworthy and less able to do its vital work.
The federal employees acting as protesters on the job and the members of Congress acting as commentators on the floor of the House may genuinely believe they are speaking on behalf of outraged Americans let down by these institutions. But they are actually exacerbating the causes of those Americans’ cynicism.

XVRHEML3HV_UZT91CB855ZSBY0,DeSantis Appears to Misattribute a Quote to Churchill as He Drops Out of Primary,By Angelo Fichera,"Jan. 21, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/us/politics/desantis-churchill-quote.html,"WHAT WAS SAID
“‘Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.’ — Winston Churchill”
— Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, in a post on X announcing the end of his presidential campaign.
There is no record of the former British prime minister, who died in 1965, saying those words, according to the International Churchill Society, which features the statement on a list of quotes that are wrongly tied to Mr. Churchill.
Another quote, “Success is going from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm,” is listed alongside it.
“We can find no attribution for either one of these, and you will find that they are broadly attributed to Winston Churchill,” the organization reports. “They are found nowhere in his canon, however.”"
YW3TF2EXPG_PQ04NA6U2Q55A22,Three Killed in Medical Helicopter Crash in Oklahoma,By Rebecca Carballo,"Published Jan. 21, 2024Updated Jan. 22, 2024",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/us/oklahoma-helicopter-crash-air-evac.html,"Three crew members died in a medical helicopter crash in Oklahoma on Saturday after transporting a patient, according to the company that runs the service.
The company, Air Evac Lifeteam, said on social media that the crew members lost contact with the company’s control center around 11:23 p.m. local time while they were returning to their base in Weatherford, Okla., about 70 miles west of Oklahoma City.
The company said the crew members were headed to Weatherford after transporting a patient in Oklahoma City. The Federal Aviation Administration said the helicopter, a Bell 206L-3, crashed around midnight, though where exactly was not immediately clear.
Air Evac Lifeteam said it would not, at this time, publicly identify the crew members and that it was turning over the investigation to the National Transportation Safety Board.
An N.T.S.B. investigator was expected to be at the crash scene on Sunday to begin documenting and examining the aircraft, officials said.
The investigation will examine any recordings of air traffic control communications, radar data, weather reports, witness statements and a 72-hour background of the pilot to determine whether there were any issues that could have affected the pilot’s ability to safely operate the flight, among other information.
“It is important to note that N.T.S.B. does not determine cause in the early part of the investigative process,” the agency said in a statement. “This is considered the fact-gathering phase of the investigation.”
Air Evac Lifeteam operates more than 150 helicopter air ambulance bases in 18 states, according to its website. Crews consist of a pilot, a flight nurse and a flight paramedic.
About 90 percent of its patient transports originate from a rural area as defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, according to the company."
ZRVDO9UZXF_O3W0607EPQDE1RD,"Deep Under Gaza, Evidence of Cells and Hostages, Israel Says","By Isabel KershnerIsabel Kershner traveled with Israeli troops into Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, and spent two hours underground in a Hamas tunnel compound.","Jan. 24, 2024, 6:15 a.m. ET",20240121,nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/21/world/middleeast/deep-under-gaza-evidence-of-cells-and-hostages-israel-says.html,"In a subterranean compound deep below Khan Younis, a Hamas stronghold in the southern Gaza Strip, the five cells with barred doors that the Israeli military says held hostages abducted from Israel had clearly been constructed long in advance.
The tunnel builders even paid some attention to décor: The tiled walls of a small kitchenette in the compound, littered with remnants of food and dirty dishes, were embellished with a quaint, if incongruous, motif of teapots and teacups.
The Israeli military said that roughly 20 hostages were kept in the compound at various times. It said it pieced that assessment together based on testimony it said it gathered from the captives, as well as evidence like DNA. Some were released among the more than 100 hostages freed during a weeklong truce in late November, while others, including older people, were later dispersed to other locations in Gaza, the military said.
There has been no independent confirmation of the Israeli account of the compound, but details provided to Israeli media by one of the hostages — who was freed in November and, Israel says, held in the Khan Younis compound — aligns with some of those assertions.
Some 240 captives were seized during the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli officials. More than 25,000 Gazans have been killed so far, most of them civilians, according to health authorities in the enclave, following a punishing counterattack by Israel.
A journalist for The New York Times descended on Friday morning into the dark labyrinth leading to the compound under Khan Younis, escorted by Israeli soldiers and military officials to show what they said were the conditions in which the hostages had been held.
An arched chamber at the mouth of the corridor leading to the cells with barred doors was covered with green carpeting, like fake grass, and strewed with detritus.
Amid a jumble of blankets with floral patterns and plastic bottles lay several empty tubes labeled RPG-7VR, a kind of rocket-propelled grenade, and bearing the insignia of Hamas’s military wing, the Qassam Brigades. In a dim corner, there were four standing fans, a half-used pack of disposable diapers and a metal Palestine Red Crescent Society first-aid case containing a packet of latex gloves and a few sealed gauze pads.
The guided visit to the compound came as Israel, after more than 100 days of fighting in Gaza, appeared increasingly torn between the dueling war goals of dismantling Hamas’s military and its governing abilities and of freeing the remaining 130 or so captives, which will most likely require a diplomatic deal involving a cease-fire.
At least 25 of the captives have already been declared dead, and many Israelis fear that time is running out for the rest. The military offensive has slowed, complicated by the sheer scope and sophistication of Hamas’s vast tunnel network that crisscrosses the Palestinian enclave, extending for hundreds of miles, according to Israeli intelligence.
Beneath Khan Younis alone, the military estimates that Hamas dug at least 100 miles of tunnels across several levels, creating an inverted, multistory complex.
“We are fighting in Khan Younis above ground and below ground,” said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military, who led the tour of the subterranean compound on Friday. He added, “This kind of warfare is unlike any other modern battlefield anywhere in the world.”
The spiraling death toll in Gaza has increased international pressure on Israel to end the war. Above ground, much of Gaza is in ruins.
“Israel does not seek destruction,” Admiral Hagari said. “This war is a tragedy.” But there is no way to destroy tunnels built beneath civilian areas without damaging the structures above, he said, adding, “Hamas knows that.”
The Times and other journalists accepted a military escort to visit the underground compound and secure rare access to wartime Gaza, which is mainly off-limits to the outside news media.
After a half-hour journey in an armored vehicle, the journalists were taken to a ground-level entrance with an open metal door in the side of a three-story apartment building that led down a staircase to a maze of tunnels that branched out in different directions. The neighborhood, in eastern Khan Younis, had been evacuated.
The tunnel entrance, located under the residence of a Hamas operative, was booby-trapped with explosives, according to the Israeli military. As soldiers of the 98th Paratroopers Division advanced along the underground route, they encountered blast doors and engaged in close combat with several fighters, who were killed, the military said. By the time the soldiers reached the carpeted chamber and cells, the hostages had been moved to another location, the military said, without saying when it believed hostages had last been present there.
The compound was about a half-mile into the warren of tunnels, which was lined with electricity and communications cables, and about 65 feet — or about six floors — underground. To reach it required walking single file through pitch darkness and walking down long flights of stairs carved into the earth. The air was thick and humid.
In the abandoned chamber, which was equipped with basic light fittings, the Israeli military said soldiers had found two drawings by a child. The military showed photographs of the drawings — both of a house against a backdrop of hills with a sun and clouds in the sky — that it said were drawn by Emilia Aloni, 5, an Israeli girl who was abducted with her mother, Danielle Aloni, 44, on Oct. 7 from Kibbutz Nir Oz. After nearly seven weeks in captivity, the Alonis were released in a first group of 13 hostages, all women and children, under the temporary truce deal in November.
In interviews with Israeli television channels after the hostages’ release, Ms. Aloni displayed pictures she said were drawn by her daughter in captivity that closely resembled those the Israeli military said had been found in the compound under Khan Younis.
In the television interviews, Ms. Aloni said she and her daughter were taken into a tunnel soon after arriving in Gaza and then walked for hours in what she described as an “underground city.” Eventually, she said, they came to a kind of “cave” where there were about a dozen other captives, including wounded older people and a teenager.
Ms. Aloni recalled sleeping on mattresses next to other hostages in extremely humid conditions with little air, making it hard to breathe.
The Alonis were held underground for several days and then moved to an apartment above ground where they stayed for nearly two weeks with other hostages, Ms. Aloni said. They were then returned to the tunnels for safety, she said, as Israeli fighter jets pounded Gaza.
Ms. Aloni appeared in a hostage video in late October with two other women, Rimon Kirsht, 36, and Yelena Trupanob, 50, who were also released a month later.
In a document released on Sunday by Hamas in which it provided its own narrative of recent events, the group said that it “dealt in a positive and kind manner with all the civilians who have been held in Gaza.”
Many of the released hostages say they received little food and water, inadequate medical treatment, if any, and were kept in tough conditions.
The Israeli military said some of the hostages were kept in the central chamber and others in the narrow cells with the barred doors. The cells had clinical white-tiled walls broken by a vertical purple stripe with a toilet and sink in the back of each one; some also had a small shower nozzle. Soldiers escorting the journalists said that strands of hair had been found in the cells, as well as a bra. The military said DNA testing matched the hair with hostages, but did not say who.
Ayala Metzger, the daughter-in-law of Yoram Metzger, 80, who is still a captive in Gaza, told Israel’s Channel 12 News on Sunday that his DNA was found on clothes left behind in the compound.
A boiler provided hot water when there was electricity.
Any hostages kept in the compound would have had little sense of time below ground, or of the destruction taking place on the surface.
Emerging back into sunlight two hours after entering the tunnel, the subterranean silence was replaced for the reporters accompanying the Israeli military on Friday by the sounds of war. A drone whined in the sky. Sharp cracks and booms stirred up plumes of dark smoke.
The neighborhood is a wasteland, surrounded by mounds of earth and rubble and churned up roads.
Inside the house that Israel says belonged to the Hamas operative, a marble staircase hinted at a level of opulence. Copper and gold curtains still hung at blown-out windows in a lower-floor bedroom, and most of an outside wall had gone. Not one building in the vicinity looked habitable.
By Saturday, the tunnels and the compound below the neighborhood had been blown up.
