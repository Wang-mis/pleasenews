The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) is scheduled to meet on September 3 to review and potentially approve these initiatives, news agency ANI reported.
The meeting, chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, will be attended by key officials such as the chief of defense staff, the three service chiefs, and the defence secretary, according to the report.
During the meeting, the DAC is expected to authorize projects worth over Rs 1.3 lakh crore, according to Defence Ministry sources.
A major proposal on the agenda is the Indian Navy's acquisition of seven new warships under Project 17 Bravo, which will be the most advanced stealth frigates built in India, following the Nilgiri-class frigates currently under construction.
The DAC is likely to approve a tender worth around Rs 70,000 crore for Indian shipyards, in line with the 'Make in India' initiative, including private sector shipyards.
The tender for Project 17 Bravo is expected to be targeted at Category A shipyards, such as Mazagon Dockyards Limited (MDL), Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE), Goa Shipyard Limited, and Larsen & Toubro.
MDL and GRSE are currently building frigates under Project 17A (Nilgiri-class), with MDL responsible for four and GRSE for three.
The meeting will consider the Indian Army's proposal to replace its Russian-origin T-72 tanks with 1,700 future-ready combat vehicles (FRCVs), at a cost of over Rs 50,000 crore, to modernize its armoured regiments.
